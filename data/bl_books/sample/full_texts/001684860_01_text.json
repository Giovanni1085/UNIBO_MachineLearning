THE object of this work is to preserve, so far as possible, the most important facts connected with the territory, embraced within the limits of Licking county, from the anti-historic age to the present time. In order to give the narrative a more perfect and connected form, a brief, but comprehensive, history of Ohio by A. A. Graham, is first given, followed by a general and detailed history of the county, from the earliest date at which any authentic information could be obtained. Geologically and topographically the county is far above the average in point of interest, while arch\u00e6ologically it is by far the richest field in the State and is, perhaps, not excelled, if equaled, by any other of equal dimensions in the United States, hence this subject receives unusual attention, both in a general chapter, and in the histories of the townships in which arch\u00e6ological remains appear. The Indian history of the county is somewhat meagre, but the first settlement by the white race, and the extension and development of the settlements, have been thoroughly traced, while the habits and customs of the pioneers have received such attention as space would permit. Following these the general history of the county traces its agricultural resources, its great internal im provements, its city, towns, villages, schools, churches, its public men and prominent citizens, and many other matters connected with its growth. The war history, by Major C. D. Miller, of Newark, including the War of 1812, the Mexican war and that of the great Rebellion, speak volumes for the patriotism of the county, in the liberal contri bution of its great recources to the honor and preservation of the Government, under which it enjoys the blessings of civil liberty, and the highest condition of civilization and happiness yet attained among the peoples of the earth. Probably no county in the State has a more complete military history. Following this, each township in the county has received a separate history, in proportion to the prominence of each in the generel development, or which, by reason of geographical location, or other advantages or disadvantages, has made a greater or less amount of interesting history. The Welsh Hills' settlement and the Granville colony, both in Granville township, mark an important era in the settlement of the county, and are fully treated. The biographical department, at the conclusion of the works, will, to many, be the most interesting part, containing, as it does, biographical sketches of nearly all the pioneers, prominent citizens, and patrons of the work. To the Historical Society, as an organization, and to the following individual members and others who have contributed valuable historical papers to the records of the society (which records have been freely and generously placed in their hands), the publisher and compiler are indebted for much of the mat ter contained in the following pages : Isaac Smucker, B. C. Woodward, C. B. Giffin, M. M. Munson, A. B. Clark, Rev. T. W. Howe, Gaptain Joseph M. Scott, Samuel Park, General Rufus Putnam, Rev. Israel Thrapp, Rev. W. Bower, Judge Brumback, Jacob Winter, D. D. Woods, William Knowles, Captain E. Z. Clarke, and others. Those who have departed for the \"shadow land,\" but who left behind them valuable historical"], [8, "PREFACE. papers, which have found their way into these pages, are: Rev. C. Springer, Dr. J. N. Wilson, Rev. H. M. Hervey, Revel Everett, William Wing, Mrs. Stadden, Jacob F. Conine, Dr. J. H. Coul ter, Rev. S. P. Hildreth, and others. To Mr. Isaac Smucker, the faithful and laborious secretary of the society, the kind-hearted gentle man, and venerable historical writer, the publisher and compiler desire to return their grateful acknowledge ments, not only for many and valuable contributions, but for kindly advice and material aid, always freely extended. His large contributions to the records of the society; his well-known ability and reputation as a careful writer, which reputation is not confined to Licking county or the State of Ohio; his deep interest in historical matters, and conscientious regard for the duties of a faithful historian, mark him above all others as the man to whom the people of this county are indebted for the preservation of whatever is valuable in its history. Although accuracy beyond criticism is not claimed, yet the work will be found measurably correct and will bear careful criticism. Mr. Smucker read the proof (except the military part, read by Major Miller) and as the entire work, in all its various stages, has had his careful supervision, and a large num ber of its pages bear the impress of his handiwork, it is given to the public with much confidence in its accuracy. The volume contains all that is necessary to impress upon the mind of the reader a picture of the growth and development of the county, from its birth in the wilderness to its present proud position among the rich and enlightened counties of the State. Licking county is comparatively in its youth, but has probably made more and valuable history in the last eighty years, than it will make in the next several centuries. These years have been prolific in mighty changes, not only in the history of the county, but of the world. If what is worthy of consideration in the history of the county has been rescued from oblivion, and placed in consecutive and readable form for the present generation, and future historian, the object of this work has been fully accomplished.

INTRODUCTORY \u2014TOPOGRAPHY -GEOLOGY PRIMITIVE-RACES \u2014ANTIQUITIES \u2014INDIAN TRIBES a State. Such was not the ease with the other States of the West ; all were Territories, with Terri torial forms of government, ere they became States. Ohio's boundaries are, on the north, Lakes Erie and Michigan ; on the west, Indiana ; on the south, the Ohio River, separating it from Kentucky; and, on the east, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. It is situated between 38\u00b0 25' and 42\u00b0 north latitude ; and 80\u00b0 30' and 84\u00b0 50' west longitude from Greenwich, or 3\u00b0 30' and 7\u00b0 50' west from Washington. Its greatest length, from north to south, is 210 miles; the extreme width, from east to west, 220 miles. Were this an exact out line, the area of the State would be 40,200 square miles, or 29,568,000 acres ; as the outlines of the State are, however, rather irregular, the area is estimated at 39,964 square miles, or 25,576,960 acres. In the last census \u2014 1870 \u2014 the total num ber of1 acres in Ohio is given as 21,712,420, of which 14,469,132 acres are improved, and 6,883, 575 acres are woodland. By the last statistical report of the State Auditor, 20,965,371s acres are reported as taxable lands. This omits many acres untaxable for various reasons, which would make the estimate, 25,576,960, nearly correct. THE present State of Ohio, comprising an extent of country 210 miles north and south, 220 miles east and west, in length and breadth \u2014 25,576,969 acres \u2014 is a part of the Old Northwest Territory. This Territory embraced all of the present States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and so much of Minnesota as lies east of the Mississippi River. It became a corporate existence soon after the formation of the Virginia Colony, and when that colony took on the dignity of State government it became a county thereof, whose exact outline was unknown. The county embraced in its limits more territory than is com prised in all the New England and Middle States, and was the largest county ever known in the United States. It is watered by the finest system of rivers on the globe ; while its inland seas are without a parallel. Its entire southern boundary is traversed by the beautiful Ohio, its western by the majestic Mississippi, and its northern and a part of its eastern are bounded by the fresh-water lakes, whose clear waters preserve an even temper ature over its entire surface. Into these reservoirs of commerce flow innumerable streams of limpid water, which come from glen and dale, from mountain and valley, from forest and prairie \u2014 all avenues of health, commerce and prosperity. Ohio is in the best part of this territory \u2014 south of its river are tropical heats ; north of Lake Erie are polar snows and a polar climate. The territory comprised in Ohio has always re mained, the same. Ohio's history differs somewhat from other States, in that it was never under Ter ritorial government. When it was created, it was made a State, and did not pass through the stage incident to the most of other States, i. e., exist as a Territory before being advanced to the powers of The face of the country, in Ohio, taken as a whole, presents the appearance . of an extensive monotonous plain. It is moderately undulating but not mouulainous, and is excavated in places by the streams coursing over its surface, whose waters have forced a way for themselves through cliffs of sandstone rock, leaving abutments of this material in bold outline. There are no mountain ranges, geological uplifts or peaks. A low ridge enters the State, near the northeast corner, and crosses it in a southwesterly direction, emerging near the inter section of the 40th degree of north latitude with"], [24, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 12 the western boundary of the State. This \"divide\" separates the lake and Ohio River waters, and main tains an elevation of a little more than thirteen hundred feet above the level of the ocean. The highest part is in Logan County, where the eleva tion is 1,550 feet. unite at Pittsburgh. The entire length of the river, from its source to its mouth, is 950 miles, though by a straight line from Pittsburgh to Cairo, it is only 615 miles. Its current is very gentle, hardly three miles per hour, the descent being only five inches per mile. At high stages, the rate of the current increases, and at low stages decreases. Sometimes it is barely two miles per hour. The average range between high and low water mark is fifty feet, although several times the river has risen more than sixty feet above low water mark. At the lowest stage of the river, it is fordable many places between Pittsburgh and Cincinnati. The river abounds in islands, some of which are exceed ingly fertile, and noted in the history of the West. Others, known as \"tow-heads,\" are simply deposits of sand. The Scioto is one of the largest inland streams in the State, and is one of the most beautiful riv ers. It rises in Hardin County, flows southeast erly to Columbus, where it receives its largest affluent, the Olentangy er Whetstone, after which its direction is southerly until it enters the Ohio at Portsmouth. It flows through one of the rich est valleys in the State, and has for its compan ion the Ohio and Erie Canal, for a distance of ninety miles. Its tributaries are, besides the Whet stone, the Darby, Walnut and Paint Creeks. The Muskingum River is formed by the junc tion of the Tuscarawas and Waldhoning Rivers, which rise in the northern part of the State and unite at Coshocton. From the junction, the river flows in a southeastern course about one hundred miles, through a rich and populous valley, to the Ohio, at Marietta, the oldest settlement in the State. At its outlet, the Muskingum is over two hundred yards wide. Ry improvements, it has been made navigable ninety-five miles above Mari etta, as far as Dresden, where a side cut, three miles long, unites its waters with those of the Ohio Canal. All along this stream exist, in abundant profusion, the remains of an ancient civiliza tion, whose history is lost in the twilight of antiq uity. Extensive mounds, earthworks and various fortifications, are everywhere to be found, inclosing a mute history as silent as the race that dwelt here and left these traces of their evistence. The same may be said of all the other valleys in Ohio. The Miami River \u2014 the scenes of many exploits in pioneer days \u2014 rises in Hardin County, near the headwaters of the Scioto, and runs southwesterly, to the Ohio, passing Troy, Dayton and Hamilton. It is a beautiful and rapid stream, flowing through North of this ridge the surface is generally level, with a gentle inclination toward the lake, the ine qualities of the surface being caused by the streams which empty into the lake. The central part of Ohio is almost, in general, a level plain, about one thousand feet above the level of the sea, slightly inclining southward. The Southern part of the State is rather hilly, the valleys growing deeper as they incline toward the great valley of the Ohio, which is several hundred feet below the general level of the State. In the southern counties, the surface is generally* diversified by the inequalities produced by the excavating power of the Ohio River and its tributaries, exercised through long periods of time. There are a few prairies, or plains, in the central and northwestern parts of the State, but over its greater portion originally existed im mense growths of timber. The \" divide,\" or water-shed, referred to, between the waters of Lake Erie and the Ohio River, is less elevated in Ohio than in New York and Penn sylvania, though the difference is small. To a per son passing over the State in a balloon, its surface presents an unvarying plain, while, to one sailing down the Ohio River, it appears mountainous. On this river are bluffs ranging from two hundred and fifty to six hundred feet in height. As one ascends the tributaries of the river, these bluffs diminish in heiglit until they become gentle undu lations, while toward the sources of the streams, in the central part of the State, the banks often become low and marshy. The principal rivers are the Ohio, Muskingum, Scioto and Miami, on the southern slope, emptying into the Ohio ; on the northern, the Maumee, Sandusky, Huron and Cuyahoga, emptying into Lake Erie, and,' all but the first named, entirely in Ohio. The Ohio, the chief river of the State, and from which it derives its name, with its tributaries, drains a country whose area is over two hundred thousand square miles in extent, and extending frota the water-shed to Alabama. The river was first dis covered by La Salle in 1669, and was by him nav igated as far as the Falls, at Louisville, Ky. It is formed by the junction of the Alleghany and Monongahela rivers, in Pennsylvania, whose waters"], [25, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 13 a highly productive and populous valley, in which limestone and hard timber are abundant. Its total length is about one hundred and fifty miles. The Maumee is the largest river in the northern part of Ohio. It rises in Indiana and flows north easterly, into Lake Erie. About eighty miles of its course are in Ohio. It is navigable as far as Perrysburg, eighteen miles from its mouth. The other rivers north of the divide are all small, rapid-running streams, affording a large amount of good water-power, much utilized by mills and man ufactories. A remarkable feature of the topography of Ohio is its almost total absence of natural lakes or ponds. A few very small ones are found near the water-shed, but all too small to be of any practical value save as watering-places for stock. Lake Erie, which forms nearly all the northern boundary of the State, is next to the last or lowest of America's \" inland seas.\" It is 290 miles long, and 57 miles wide at its greatest part. There are no islands, except in the shallow water at the west end, and very few bays. The greatest depth of the lake is off Long Point, where the water is 312 feet deep. The shores are principally drift-clay or hard-pan, upon which the waves are continually encroaching. At Cleveland, from the first sur vey, in 1796, to 1842, the encroachment was 218 feet along the entire city front. The entire coast is low, seldom rising above fifty feet at the water's edge. Lake Erie, like the others, has a variable sur face, rising and falling with the seasons, like great rivers, called the \" annual fluctuation,\" and a gen eral one, embracing a series of years, due to mete orological causes, known as the \" secular fluctua tion.\" Its lowest known level was in February, 1819, rising more or less each year, until June, 1838, in the extreme, to six feet eight inches. Lake Erie has several excellent harbors in Ohio, among which are Cleveland, Toledo, Sandusky, Port Clinton and Ashtabula. Valuable improve ments have been made in some of these, at the expense of the General Government. In 1818, the first steamboat was launched on the lake. Owing to the Falls of Niagara, it could go no farther east than the outlet of Niagara River. Since then, however, the opening of the Welland Canal, in Canada, allows vessels drawing not more than ten feet of water to pass from one lake to the other, greatly facilitating navigation. As early as 1836, Dr. S.'P. Hildreth, Dr. John Locke, Prof. J. H. Riddle and Mr. I. A. Lapham, were appointed a committee by the Legislature of Ohio to report the \" best method of obtaining a complete geological survey of the State, and an estimate of the probable cost of the same.\" In the preparation of their report, Dr. Hildreth examined the coal-measures in the southeastern part of the State, Prof. Riddle and Mr. Lapham made exam inations in the western and northern counties, while Dr. Locke devoted his attention to chemical analyses. These investigations resulted in the presentation of much valuable information con cerning the mineral resources of the State and in a plan for a geological survey. In accordance with the recommendation of this Committee, the Legislature, in 1837, passed a bill appropriating $12,000 for the prosecution of the work during the next year. The Geological Corps appointed consisted of W. W. Mather, State Geologist, with Dr. Hildreth, Dr. Locke, Prof. J. P. Kirtland, J. W. Foster, Charles Whittlesey and Charles Briggs, Jr., Assistants. The results of the first year's work appeared in 1838, in an octavo volume of 134 pages, with contributions from Mather, Hildreth, Briggs, Kirtland and Whittlesey. In 1838, the Legislature ordered the continuance of the work, and, at the close of the year, a second report, of 286 pages, octavo, was issued, containing contribu tions from all the members of the survey. Succeeding Legislatures failed to provide for a continuance of the work, and, save that done by private means, nothing was accomplished till 1869, when the Legislature again took up the work. In the interim, individual enterprise had done much. In 1841, Prof. James Hall passed through the State, and, by his indentification of several of the formations with those of New York, for the first time fixed their geological age. The next year, he issued the first map of the geology of the State, in common with the geological maps of all the region between the Alleghanies and the Mississippi. Similar maps were published by Sir Charles Lyell, in 1845 ; Prof. Edward Hitchcock, in 1853, and by J. Mareon, in 1856. The first individual map of the geology of Ohio was a very small one, published by Col. Whittlesey, in 1848, in Howe's History. In 1856, he published a larger map, and, in 1865, another was issued by Prof. Nelson Sayler. In 1867, Dr. J. S. Newberry published a geological map and sketch of Ohio in the Atlas of the State issued by H. S. Stebbins. Up to this time, the geological knowledge was very general in its character, and, consequently, errone ous in many of its details. Other States had been"], [26, "14 HISTORY OF OHIO. accurately surveyed, yet Ohio remained a kind of terra incognita, of which the geology was less known than any part of the surrounding area. In 1869, the Legislature appropriated, for a new survey, $13,900 for its support during one year, and appointed Dr. Newberry Chief Geologist ; E. R. Andrews, Edward Orton and J. H. Klippart were appointed Assistants, and T. G. Wormley, Chemist. The result of the first year's work was a volume of 164 pages, octavo, published in 1870. This report, accompanied by maps and charts, for the first time accurately defined the geological formations as to age and area. Evidence was given which set at rest questions of nearly thirty years' standing, and established the fact that Ohio in cludes nearly double the number of formations be fore supposed to exist. Since that date, the sur veys have been regularly made. Each county is being surveyed by itself, and its formation ac curately determined. Elsewhere in these pages, these results are given, and to them the reader is referred for the specific geology of the county. Only general results can be noted here. On the general geological map of the State, are two sections of the State, taken at each northern and southern extremity. These show, with the map, the general outline of the geological features of Ohio, and are all that can be given here. Roth sections show the general arrangements of the formation, and prove that they lie in sheets resting one upon another, but not horizontally, as a great arch traverses the State from Cincinnati to the lake shore, between Toledo and Sandusky. Along this line, which extends southward to Nashville, Tenn., all the rocks are raised in a ridge or fold, once a low mountain chain. In the lapse of ages, it has, however, been extensively worn away, and now, along a large part of its course, the strata which once arched over it are re moved from its summit, and are found resting in regular order on either side, dipping away from its axis. Where the ridge was highest, the erosion has been greatest, that being the reason why the oldest rocks are exposed in the region about Cin cinnati. Ry following the line of this great arch from Cincinnati northward, it will be seen that the Helderberg limestone (No. 4), midway of the State, is still unbroken, and stretches from side to side ; while the Oriskany, the Corniferous, the Hamilton and the Huron formations, though generally re moved from the crown of the arch, still remain over a limited area near Rellefontaine, where they form an island, which proves the former continuity of the strata which compose it. On the east side of the great anticlinal axis, the rocks dip down into a basin, which, for several hundred miles north and south, occupies the inter val between the Nashville and Cincinnati ridge and the first fold of the Alleghany Mountains. In this basin, all the strata form trough-like layers, their edges outcropping eastward on the flanks of the Alleghanies, and westward along the anti clinal axis. As they dip from this margin east ward toward the center of the trough, near its middle, on the eastern border of the State, the older rocks are deeply buried, and the surface is here underlaid by the highest and most recent of our rock formations, the coal measures. In the northwestern corner of the State, the strata dip northwest from the anticlinal and pass under the Michigan coal basin, precisely as the same forma tions east of the anticlinal dip beneath the Alle ghany coal-field, of which Ohio's coal area forms a part. The rocks underlying the State all belong to three of the great groups which geologists have termed \" systems,\" namely, the Silurian, Devonian and Carboniferous. Each of these are again sub divided, for convenience, and numbered. Thus the Silurian system includes the Cincinnati group, the Medina and Clinton groups, the Niagara group, and the Salina and Water-Line groups. The Devonian system includes the Oriskany sand stone, the Carboniferous limestone, the Hamilton group, the Huron shale and the Erie shales. The Carboniferous system includes the Waverly group, the Carboniferous Conglomerate, the Coal Meas ures and the Drift. This last includes the surface, and has been divided into six parts, numbering from the lowest, viz.: A glacialed surface, the Gla cial Drift, the Erie Clays, the Forest Red, the Ice berg Drift and the Terraces or Reaches, which mark intervals of stability in the gradual recession of the water surface to its present level. \" The history we may learn from these forma tions,\" says the geologist, \"is something as fol lows: \" First. Subsequent to the Tertiary was a period of continual elevation, during which the topog raphy of the country was much the same as now, the draining streams following the lines they now do, but cutting down their beds until they flowed sometimes two hundred feet lower than they do at present. In the latter part of this period of ele vation, glaciers, descending from the Canadian"], [27, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 15 islands, excavated and occupied the valleys of the great lakes, and covered the lowlands down nearly to the Ohio. \"Second. Ry a depression of the land and ele vation of temperature, the glaciers retreated north ward, leaving, in the interior of the continent, a great basin of fresh water, in which the Erie clays were deposited. \" Third. This water was drained away until a broad land surface was exposed within the drift area. Upon this surface grew forests, largely of red and white cedar, inhabited by the elephant, mastodon, giant beaver and other large, now ex tinct, animals. \"Fourth. The submergence of this ancient land and the spreading over it, by iceberg agency, of gravel, sand and bowlders, distributed just as ice bergs now spread their loads broadcast over the sea bottom on the banks of Newfoundland. \"Fifth. The gradual draining-off of the waters, leaving the land now as we find it, smoothly cov ered with all the layers of the drift, and well pre pared for human occupation.\" \" In six days, the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and rested the seventh day,\" records .the Scriptures, and, when all was done, He looked upon the work of His own hands and pronounced it \" good.\" Surely none but a divine, omnipotent hand could have done all this, and none can study the \"work of His hands\" and not marvel at its completeness. The ancient dwellers of the Mississippi Valley will always be a subject 'of great interest to the antiquarian. Who they were, and whence they came, are still unanswered questions, and may remain so for ages. All over this valley, and, in fact, in all parts of the New World, evidences of an ancient civilization exist, whose remains are now a wonder to all. The aboriginal races could throw no light on these questions. They had always seen the remains, and knew not whence they came. Explorations aid but little in the solu tion of the problem, and only conjecture can be entertained. The remains found in Ohio equal any in the Valley. Indeed, some of them are vast in extent, and consist of forts, fortifications, moats, ditches, elevations and mounds, embracing many acres in extent. \"It is not yet determined,\" says Col. Charles Whittlesey, \"whether we have discovered the first or the original people who occupied the soil of Ohio. Modern investigations are bringing to light evidences of earlier races. Since the presence of man has been established in Europe as a cotempor ary of the fossil elephant, mastodon, rhinoceros and the horse, of the later drift or glacial period, we may reasonably anticipate the presence of man in America in that era. Such proofs are already known, but they are not of that conclusive charac ter which amounts to a demonstration. It is, how ever, known that an ancient people inhabited Ohio in advance of the red men who were found here, three centuries since, by the Spanish and French explorers. \" Five and six hundred years before the arrival of Columbus,\" says Col. Charles Whittlesey, \"the Northmen sailed from Norway, Iceland and Green land along the Atlantic coast as far as Long Island. They found Indian tribes, in what is now New En gland, closely resembling those who lived upon the coast and the St. Lawrence when the French and English came to possess these regions. \" These red Indians had no traditions of a prior people ; but over a large part of the lake country and the valley of the Mississippi, earth-works, mounds, pyramids, ditches and forts were discov ered \u2014 the work of a more ancient race, and a peo ple far in advance of the Indian. If they were not civilized, they were not barbarians. They were not mere hunters, but had fixed habitations, cultivated the soil and were possessed of consider able mechanical skill. We know them as the Mound- Builders, because they erected over the mortal remains of their principal men and women memorial mounds of earth or unhewn stone \u2014 of which hundreds remain to our own day, so large and high that they give rise to an impression of the numbers and energy of their builders, such as we receive from the pyramids of Egypt.\" Might they not have been of the same race and the same civilization ? Many competent authori ties conjecture they are the work of the lost tribes of Israel ; but the best they or any one can do is only conjecture. \" In the burial-mounds,\" continues Col. Whit tlesey, \" there are always portions of one or more human skeletons, generally partly consumed by fire, with ornaments of stone, bone, shells, mica and copper. The largest mound in Ohio is near Miainisburg, Montgomery County. It is the second largest in the West, being nearly seventy feet high, originally, and about eight hundred feet in circumference. This would give a superficial area of nearly four acres. In 1864, the citizens of Miamisburg sunk a shaft from the summit, to the natural surface, without finding the bones"], [28, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 16 or ashes of the great man for whom it was intended. The exploration has considerably lowered the mound, it being now about sixty feet in height. \" Fort Ancient, on the Little Miami, is a good specimen of the military defenses of the Mound- Ruilders. It is well located on a long, high, nar row, precipitous ridge. The parapets are now from ten to eighteen feet high, and its perimeter is sufficient to hold twenty thousand fighting men. Another prominent example of their works exists near Newark, Licking County. This collection presents a great variety of figures, circles, rectan gles, octagons and parallel banks, or highways, covering more than a thousand acres. The county fair-ground is permanently located within an ancient circle, a quarter of a mile in diameter, with an embankment and interior ditch. Its high est place was over twenty feet from the top of the moat to the bottom of the ditch.\" One of the most curious-shaped works in this county is known as the \"Alligator,\" from its sup posed resemblance to that creature. When meas ured, several years ago, while in a good state of preservation, its dimensions were two hundred and ten feet in length, average width over sixty feet, and height, at the highest point, seven feet. It appears to be mainly composed of clay, and is overgrown with grass. Speaking of the writing of these people, Col. Whittlesey says : \" There is no evidence that they had alphabetical characters, picture-writing or hieroglyphics, though they must have had some mode of recording events. Neither is there any proof that they used domestic animals for tilling the soil, or for the purpose of erecting the imposing earth works they have left. A very coarse cloth of hemp, flax or nettles has been found on their burial-hearths and around skeletons not consumed by fire. \" The most extensive earthworks occupy many of the sites of modern towns, and are always in the vicinity of excellent land. Those about the lakes are generally irregular earth forts, while those about the rivers in the southern part of the State are generally altars, pyramids, circles, cones and rectangles of earth, among which fortresses or strongholds are exceptions. \" Those on the north may not have been cotem porary or have been built by the same people. They are far less prominent or extensive, which indicates a people less in numbers as well as indus try, and whose principal occupation was war among themselves or against their neighbors. This style of works extends eastward along the south shore of Lake Ontario, through New York. In Ohio, there is a space along the water-shed, between the lake and the Ohio, where there are few, if any, ancient earthworks. It appears to have been a vacant or neutral ground between different nations. \" The Indians of the North, dressed in skins, cultivated the soil very sparingly, and manufactured no woven cloth. On Lake Superior, there are ancient copper mines wrought by the Mound- Ruilders over fifteen hundred years ago.\" Copper tools are occasionally found tempered sufficiently hard to cut the hardest rocks. No knowledge of such tempering exists now. The Indians can give no more knowledge of the ancient mines than they can of the mounds on the river bottoms. \" The Indians did not occupy the ancient earth works, nor did they construct such. They were found as they are now \u2014 a hunter race, wholly averse to labor. Their abodes were in rock shel ters, in caves, or in temporary sheds of bark and boughs, or skins, easily moved from place to place. Like most savage races, their habits are unchange able ; at least, the example of white men, and their efforts during three centuries, have made little, if any, impression.\" When white men came to the territory now em braced in the State of Ohio, they found dwelling here the Iroquois, Delawares, Shawanees, Miamis, Wyandots and Ottawas. Each nation was com posed of several tribes or clans, and each was often at war with the others. The first mentioned of these occupied that part of the State whose northern boundary was Lake Erie, as far west as the mouth of the Cuyahoga River, wbere the city of Cleveland now is ; thence the boundary turned southward in an irregular line, until it touched the Ohio River, up which stream it continued to the Pennsylvania State line, and thence northward to the lake. This nation were the implacable foes of the French, owing to the fact that Champlain, in 1609, made war against them. They occupied a large part of New York and Pennsylvania, and were the most insatiate conquerors among the aborigines. When the French first came to the lakes, these monsters of the wilderness were engaged in a war against their neighbors, -a war that ended in their conquering them, possessing their terri tory, and absorbing the remnants of the tribes into their own nation. At the date of Champlain's visit, the southern shore of Lake Erie was occupied by the Eries, or, as the orthography of the word is"], [29, "17 HISTORY OF OHIO. sometimes given, Erigos, or Errienous.* About forty years afterward, the Iroquois (Five Nations) fell upon them with such fury and in such force that the nation was annihilated. Those who escaped the slaughter were absorbed among their conquerors, but allowed to live on their own lands, paying a sort of tribute to the Iroquois. This was the policy of that nation in all its conquests. A few years after the conquest of the Eries, the Iroquois again took to the war-path, and swept through Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, even attacking the Mississippi tribes. Rut for the intervention and aid of the French, these tribes would have shared the fate of the Hurons and Eries. Until the year 1700, the Iroquois held the south shore of Lake Erie so firmly that the French dared not trade or travel along that side of the lake. Their missionaries and traders penetrated this part of Ohio as early as 1650, but generally suffered death for their zeal. Having completed the conquest of the Hurons or Wyandots, about Lake Huron, and murdered the Jesuit missionaries by modes of torture which only they could devise, they permitted the residue of the Hurons to settle around the west end of Lake Erie. Here, with the Ottawas, they resided when the whites came to the State. Their country was bounded on the south by a line running through the central part of Wayne, Ashland, Richland, Crawford and Wyandot Counties. At the western boundary of this county, the line di verged northwesterly, leaving the State near the northwest corner of Fulton County. Their north ern boundary was the lake ; the eastern, the Iro quois. The Delawares, or \" Lenni Lenapes,\" whom the Iroquois had subjugated on the Susquehanna, were assigned by their conquerors hunting-grounds on the Muskingum. Their eastern boundary was the country of the Iroquois (before defined), and their northern, that of the Hurons. On the west, they * Father Louis Hennepin, in his work published in 1684, thus alludes to the Eries: -'These good fathers,\" referring to the priests, \" were great friends of the Hurons, who told them that the Iroquois went to war beyond Virginia, or New Sweden, near a lake which they called ' Erige,' or 'Erie' which signifies 'the cas,' or ' nation of the cat,'' and because these savages brought captives from this nation in returning to their cantons along this lake, the Hurons named it, in their language, 'Erige,' or ' Erike,' 'the lake of the cat,' and which our Canadians, in softeuing the word, have called ' Lake Erie.' \" Charlevoix, writing in 1721, says: \"The name it bears is that of an Indian nation of the Huron (Wyandot) language, which was formerly seated on its banks, and who have been entirely destroyed by the Iroquois. Erie, in that language, signifies 'cat,' and, in some acounts, this nation is called the ' cat nation.' This name, probably, comes from the large numbers of that animal found in this region.\" extended as far as a line drawn from the central part of Richland County, in a semi-circular direc tion, south to the mouth of Leading Creek. Their southern boundary was the Ohio River. West of the Delawares, dwelt the Shawanees, a troublesome people as neighbors, whether to whites or Indians. Their country was bounded on the north by the Hurons, on the east, by the Dela wares ; on the south, by the Ohio River. On the west, their boundary was determined by a line drawn southwesterly, and again southeasterly \u2014 semi-circular \u2014 from a point on the southern boundary of the Hurons, near the southwest corner of Wyandot County, till it intersected the Ohio River. All the remainder of the State \u2014 all its western part from the Ohio River to the Michigan line \u2014 was occupied by the Miamis, Mineamis, Twigtwees, or Tawixtawes, a powerful nation, whom the Iro quois were never fully able to subdue. These nations occupied the State, partly by per mit of the Five Nations, and partly by inheritance, and, though composed of many tribes, were about all the savages to be found in this part of the Northwest. No sooner had the Americans obtained control of this country, than they began, by treaty and purchase, to acquire the lands of the natives. They could not stem the tide of emigration ; peo ple, then as now, would go West, and hence the necessity of peacefully and rightfully acquiring the land. \" The true basis of title to Indian territory is the right of civilized men to the soil for pur poses of cultivation.\" The same maxim may be applied to all uncivilized nations. When acquired by such a right, either by treaty, purchase or con quest, the right to hold the same rests with the power and development of the nation thus possess ing the land. The English derived title to the territory between the Alleghanies and the Mississippi partly by the claim that, in discovering the Atlantic coast, they had possession of the land from \" ocean to ocean,\" and partly by the treaty of Paris, in Feb ruary, 1763. Long before this treaty took place, however, she had granted, to individuals and colo nies, extensive tracts of land in that part of Amer ica, based on the right of discovery. The French had done better, and had acquired title to the land by discovering the land itself and by consent of the Indians dwelling thereon. The right to pos sess this country led to the French and Indian war, ending in the supremacy of the English."], [30, "IS HISTORY OF OHIO. The Five Nations claimed the territory in ques tion by right of conquest, and, though professing friendship to the English, watched them with jeal ous eyes. In 1684, and again in 1726, that con federacy made cessions of lands to the English, and these treaties and cessions of lands were re garded as sufficient title by the English, and were insisted on in all subsequent treaties with the Western Nations. The following statements were collected by Col. Charles Whittlesey, which show the principal treaties made with the red men wherein land in Ohio was ceded by them to the whites : In September, 1726, the Iroquois, or Six Na tions, at Albany, ceded all their claims west of Lake Erie and sixty miles in width along the south shore of Lakes Erie and Ontario, from the Cuyahoga to the Oswego River. In 1744, this same nation made a treaty at Lancaster, Penn., and ceded to the English all their lands \"that may be within the colony of Virginia.\" In 1752, this nation and other Western tribes made a treaty at Logstown, Penn., wherein they confirmed the Lancaster treaty and consented to the settlements south of the Ohio River. February 13, 1763, a treaty was made at Paris, France, between the French and English, when Canada and the eastern half of the Mississippi Valley were ceded to the English. In 1783, all the territory south of the Lakes, and east of the Mississippi, was ceded by England to America \u2014 the latter country then obtaining its independence \u2014 by which means the country was gained by America. October 24, 1784, the Six Nations made a treaty, at Fort Stanwix, N. Y., with the Ameri cans, and ceded to them all the country claimed by the tribe, west of Pennsylvania. In 1785, the Chippewas, Delawares, Ottawas, and Wyandots ceded to the United States, at Fort Mclntosh, at the mouth of the Rig Reaver, all their claims east and south of the \"Cayahaga,\" the Portage Path, and the Tuscarawas, to Fort Laurens (Bolivar), thence to Loramie's Fort (in Shelby County) ; thence along the Portage Path to the St. Mary's River and down it to the \" Oniee,\" or Maumee, and along the lake shore to the \" Cayahaga.\" January 3, 1786, the Shawanees, at Fort Fin ney, near the mouth of the Great Miami (not owning the land on the Scioto occupied by them), were allotted a tract at the heads of the two Miamis and the Wabash, west of the Chippewas, Delawares and Wyandots. February 9, 1789, the Iroquois made a treaty at Fort Harmar, wherein they confirmed the Fort Stanwix treaty. At the same time, the Chippewas, Ottawas, Delawares, and Wyandots \u2014 to which the Sauks and Pottawatomies assented \u2014 confirmed the treaty made at Fort Mclntosh. Period of war now existed till 1795. August 3, 1795, Gen. Anthony Wayne, on behalf of the United States, made a treaty with twelve tribes, confirming the boundaries estab lished by the Fort Harmar and Fort Mclntosh treaties, and extended the boundary to Fort Re covery and the mouth of the. Kentucky River. In June, 1796, the Senecas, represented by Rrant, ceded to the Connecticut Land Company their rights east of the Cuyahoga. In 1805, at Fort Industry, on the Maumee, the Wyandots, Delawares, Ottawas, Chippewas, Shawa nees, Menses, and Pottawatomies relinquished all their lands west of the Cuyahoga, as far west as the western line of the Reserve, and south of the line from Fort Laurens to Loramie's Fort. July 4, 1807, the Ottawas, Chippewas, Wyan dots, and Pottawatomies, at Detroit, ceded all that part of Ohio north of the Maumee River, with part of Michigan. November 25, 1808, the same tribes with the Shawanees, at Rrownstown, Mich., granted the Government a tract of land two miles wide, from the west line of the Reserve to the rapids of the Maumee, for the purpose of a road through the Rlack Swamp. September 18, 1815, at Springwells, near De troit, the Chippewas, Ottawas, Pottawatomies, Wy andots, Delawares, Senecas and Miamis, having been engaged in the war of 1812 on the Rritish side, were confined in the grants made at Fort Mclntosh and Greenville in 1785 and 1795. September 29, 1817, at the rapids of the Maumee, the Wyandots ceded their lands west of the line of 1805, as far as Loramie's and the St. Mary's River and north of the Maumee. The Pottawatomies, Chippewas, and Ottawas ceded the territory west of the Detroit line of 1807, and north of the Maumee. October 6, 1818, the Miamis, at St. Mary's, made a treaty in which they surrendered the re maining Indian territory in Ohio, north of the Greenville treaty line and west of St. Mary's River. The numerous treaties of peace with the West ern Indians for the delivery of prisoners were \u2014"], [31, "HISTORY OF OHIO. IS one by Gen.

Ry the treaty at the Maumee Rapids, in 1817, reservations were conveyed by the United States to all the tribes, with a view to induce them to cultivate the soil and cease to be hunters. These were, from time to time, as the impracticability of the plan became manifest, purchased by the Gov ernment, the last of these being the Wyandot Reserve, of twelve^miles square, around Upper Sandusky, in 1842, closing out all claims and com posing all the Indian difficulties in Ohio. The open war had ceased in 1815, with the treaty of Ghent. \" It is estimated that, from the French war of 1754 to the battle of the Maumee Rapids, in 1794, a period of forty years, there had been at least 5,000 people killed or captured west of the Alleghany Mountains. Eleven organized military expeditions had been carried on against the West ern Indians prior to the war of 1812, seven regu lar engagements fought and about twelve hundred men killed. More whites were slain in battle than there were Indian braves killed in military expedi tions, and by private raids and murders ; yet, in 1811, all the Ohio tribes combined could not mus ter 2,000 warriors.\" Attempts to determine the number of persons comprising the Indian tribes in Ohio, and their location, have resulted in nothing better than estimates. It is supposed that, at the commence ment of the Revolution, there were about six thousand Indians in the present confines of the State, but their villages were little more than movable camps. Savage men, like savage beasts, are engaged in continual migrations. Now, none are left. The white man occupies the home of the red man. Now \" The verdant hills Are covered o'er with growing grain, And white men till the soil, Where once the red man used to reign.\" CHAPTER II. EARLY EXPLORATIONS IN THE WEST. WHEN war, when ambition, when avarice fail, religion pushes onward and succeeds. In the discovery of the New World, wherever man's aggrandizement was the paramount aim, failure was sure to follow. When this gave way, the followers of the Cross, whether Catholic or Protestant, came on the field, and the result before attempted soon appeared, though in a different way and through different means than those supposed. The first permanent efforts of the white race to penetrate the Western wilds of the New World preceded any permanent English settlement north of the Potomac. Years before the Pilgrims anchored their bark on the cheerless shores of Cape Cod, \"the Roman Catholic Church had been plant ed by missionaries from France in the Eastern moiety of Maine; and LeCaron, an ambitious Franciscan, the companion of Cham plain, had passed into the hunting-grounds ofthe Wyandots, and, bound by the vows of his life, had, on foot or pad dling a bark canoe, gone onward, taking alms ofthe savages until he reached the rivers of Lake Huron.\" This was in 1615 or 1616, and only eight years after Champlain had sailed up the wa ters of the St. Lawrence, and on the foot of a bold cliff laid the foundation of the present City of Quebec. From this place, founded to hold the country, and to perpetuate the religion of his King, went forth those emissaries of the Cross, whose zeal has been the admiration ofthe world. The French Colony in Canada was suppressed soon after its es tablishment, and for five years, until 1622, its im munities were enjoyed by the colonists. A grant of New France, as the country was then known, was made by Louis XIII to Richelieu, Champlain, Razilly and others, who, immediately after the res toration of Quebec by its English conquerors, entered upon the control and government of their province. Its limits embraced the whole basin of the St. Lawrence and of such other rivers in New France as flowed directly into the sea. While away to the south on the Gulf coast, was also included a country rich in foliage and claimed in virtue of the unsuccessful efforts of Coligny."], [32, "20 HISTORY OF OHIO. power declining, did they relinquish their warlike propensities, and allow the Jesuits entrance to their country. While this was going on, the traders and Jesuits had penetrated farther and farther westward, until, when peace was declared, they had seen the southwestern shores of Lake Superior and the northern shores of Lake Michigan, called by them Lake Illinois.* In August, 1654, two young adventurers penetrated the wilds bordering on these western lakes in company with a band of Ottawas. Returning, they tell of the wonderful country they have seen, of its vast forests, its abundance of game, its mines of copper, and ex cite in their comrades a desire to see and explore such a country. They tell of a vast expanse of land before them, of the pqjwerful Indian tribes dwelling there, and of their anxiety to become an nexed to the Frenchman, of whom they have heard. The request is at once granted. Two missionaries, Gabriel Dreuillettes and Leonard Gareau, were selected as envoys, but on their way the fleet, propelled by tawny rowers, is met by a wandering band of Mohawks and by them is dis persed. Not daunted, others stood ready to go. The lot fell to Ren6 Mesnard. He is charged to visit the wilderness, select a suitable place for a dwelling, and found a mission. With only a short warning he is ready, \"trusting,\" he says, \"in the Providence which feeds the little birds of the desert and clothes the wild flowers of the forest.\" In October, 1660, he reached a bay, which he called St. Theresa, on the south shore of Lake Superior. After a residence of eight months, he yielded to the invitation of the Hurons who had taken refuge on the Island of St. Michael, and bidding adieu to his neophytes and the French, he departed. While on the way to the Ray of Che goi-me-gon, probably at a portage, he became separated from his companion and was never after ward heard of. Long after, his cassock and his breviary were kept as amulets among the Sioux. Difficulties now arose in the management of the colony, and for awhile it was on the verge of dis solution. The King sent a regiment under com mand of the aged Tracy, as a safeguard against the Iroquois, now proving themselves enemies to *Mr. C. W. Butterfield, author of Cratrford's Campaign, and good authority, says: \"John Nicholet, a Frenchman, left Quebec and Three Rivers in the summer of 1634, and visited the Hurons on Georgian Bay, the Chippewas at the Sault Ste. Marie, and tho Win nebagoes in Wisconsin, returning to Quebec in the summer of 1635. This was the first white man to Bee any part of the Northwest Territory. In 1641, two Jesuit priests were at the Sault Ste. Marie for a brief time. Then two French traders reached Lake Superior, aud after them came that tide of emigration on which the French based their claim to the country.\" Religious zeal as much as commercial prosperity had influenced France to obtain and retain the de pendency of Canada. The commercial monopoly of a privileged company could not foster a colony ; the climate was too vigorous for agricult ure, and, at first there was little else except relig ious enthusiasm to give vitality to the province. Champlain had been touched by the simplicity of the Order of St. Francis, and had selected its priests to aid him in his work. But another order, more in favor at the Court, was interested, and succeed ed in excluding the mendicant order from the New World, established themselves in the new domain and, by thus enlarging the borders of the French King, it became entrusted to the Jesuits. This \"Society of Jesus,\" founded by Loyola when Calvin's Institutes first saw the light, saw an unequaled opportunity in the conversion of the heathen in the Western wilds; and, as its mem bers, pledged to obtain power only by influence of mind over mind, sought the honors of opening the way, there was no lack of men ready for the work. Through them, the motive power in opening the wilds of the Northwest was religion. \" Religious enthusiasm,\" says Bancroft, \"colonized New Eng land, and religious enthusiasm founded Montreal, made a conquest of the wilderness about the upper lakes, and explored the Mississippi.\" Through these priests \u2014 increased in a few years to fifteen \u2014 a way was made across the West from Quebec, above the regions of the lakes, below which they dared not go for the relentless Mohawks. To the northwest of Toronto, near the Lake Iro qilois, a bay of Lake Huron, in September, 1634, they raised the first humble house of the Society of Jesus among the Hurons. Through them they learned of the great lakes beyond, and resolved one day to explore them and carry the Gospel of peace to the heathen on their shores. Before this could be done, many of them were called upon to give up their lives at the martyr's stake and re ceive a martyr's crown. But one by one they went on in their good work. If one fell by hun ger, cold, cruelty, or a terrible death, others stood ready, and carrying their lives in their hands, established other missions about the eastern shores of Lake Huron and its adjacent waters. The Five Nations were for many years hostile toward the French and murdered them and their red allies whenever opportunity presented. For a quarter of century, they retarded the advance of the missionaries, and then only after wearied with a long struggle, in which they began to see their"], [33, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 81 the French. Accompanying him were Courcelles, as Governor, and M. Talon, who subsequently fig ures in Northwestern history. Ry 1665, affairs were settled and new attempts to found a mission among the lake tribes were projected. \"With better hopes \u2014 undismayed by the sad fate of their predecessors\" in August, Claude Allouez embarked on a mission by way of Ottawa to the Far West. Early in September he reached the rapids \"through which rush the waters of the lakes to Huron. Sailing by lofty sculptured rocks and over waters of crystal purity, he reached the Chippewa village just as the young warriors were bent on organizing a war expedition against the Sioux. Commanding peace in the name of his King, he called a council and offered the commerce and protection of his nation. He was obeyed, and soon a chapel arose on the shore of the bay, to which admiring crowds from the south and west gathered to listen to the story of the Cross. The scattered Hurons and Ottawas north of Lake Superior ; the Pottawatomies from Lake Mich igan ; the Sacs and Foxes from the Far West ; the Illinois from the prairies, all came to hear him, and all besought him to go with them. To the last nation Allouez desired to go. They told him of a \" great river that flowed to the sea, \"and of \"their vast prairies, where herds of buffalo, deer and other animals grazed on the tall grass.\" \"Their country,\" said the missionary, \"is the best field for the Gospel. Had I had leisure, I would have gone to their dwellings to see with my own eyes all the good that was told me of them.\" He remained two years, teaching the natives, studying their language and habits, and then returned to Quebec. Such was the account that he gave, that in two days he was joined by Louis Nicholas and was on his way back to his mission. Peace being now established, more missionaries came from France. Among them were Claude Dablon and Jacques Marquette, both of whom went on to the mission among the Chippewas at the Sault. They reached there in 1668 and found Allouez busy. The mission was now a reality and given the name of St. Mary. It is often written \" Sault Ste. Marie,\" after the French method, and is the oldest settlement by white men in the bounds of the Northwest Territory. It has been founded over two hundred years. Here on the inhospitable northern shores, hundreds of miles away from friends, did this triumvirate employ themselves in extending their religion and the influence of their King. Traversing the shores of the great lakes near them, they pass down the western bank of Lake Michigan as far as Green Bay, along the southern shore of Lake Superior to its western ex tremity, everywhere preaching the story of Jesus. \" Though suffering be their lot and martyrdom their crown,\" they went on, only conscious that they were laboring for their Master and would, in the end, win the crown. The great river away to the West of which they heard so much was yet unknown to them. To ex plore it, to visit the tribes on its banks and preach to them the Gospel and secure their trade, became the aim of Marquette, who originated the idea of its discovery. While engaged at the mission at the Sault, he resolved to attempt it in the autumn of 1669. Delay, however, intervened \u2014 for Allouez had exchanged the mission at Che-goi-me-gon for one at Green Ray, whither Marquette was sent. While here he employed a young Illinois Indian to teach him the language of that nation, and there by prepare himself for the enterprise. Continued commerce with the Western Indians gave protection and confirmed their attachment. Talon, the intendant of the colony of New France, to further spread its power and to learn more of the country and its inhabitants, convened a congress of the Indians at the Falls of St. Mary, to which he sent St. Lusson on his behalf. Nicholas Perrot sent invitations in every direction for more than a huudred leagues round about, and fourteen nations, among them Sacs, Foxes and Miamis, agreed to be present by their embassadors. The congress met on the fourth day of June, 1671. St. Lusson, through Allouez, his interpre ter, announced to the assembled natives that they, and through them their nations, were placed under the protection of the French King, and to him were their furs and peltries to be traded. A cross of cedar was raised, and amidst the groves of ma ple and of pine, of elm and hemlock that are so strangely intermingled on the banks of the St. Mary, the whole company of the French, bowing before the emblem of man's redemption, chanted to its glory a hymn of the seventh century : \"The banners of heaven's King advance; The mysteries of the Cross shines forth.\"* A cedar column was planted by the cross and marked with the lilies of the Rourbons. The power of France, thus uplifted in the West of which Ohio is now a part, was, however, not destined * Bancroft."], [34, "22 HISTORY OF OHIO. to endure, and the ambition of its monarchs was to have only a partial fulfillment. The same year that the congress was held, Mar quette had founded a mission among the Hurons at Point St. Ignace, on the continent north of the peninsula of ' Michigan. Although the climate was severe, and vegetation scarce, yet fish abounded, and at this establishment, long maintained as a key to further explorations, prayer and praise were heard daily for many years. Here, also, Marquette gained a footing among the founders of Michigan. While he was doing this, Allouez and Dablon were exploring countries south and west, going as far as the Mascoutins and Kickapoos on the Milwaukee, and the Miamis at the head of Lake Michigan. Allouez continued even as far as the Sacs and Foxes on the river which bears their name. The discovery of the Mississippi, heightened by these explorations, was now at hand. The enter prise, projected by Marquette, was received with favor by M. Talon, who desired thus to perpetuate his rule in New France, now drawing to a close. He was joined by Joliet, of Quebec, an emissary of his King, commissioned by royal magnate to take possession of the country in the name of the French. Of him but little else is known. This one excursion, however, gives him immortality, and as long as time shall last his name and that of Marquette will endure. When Marquette made known his intention to the Pottawatomies, they were filled with wonder, and endeavored to dis suade him from his purpose. \"Those distant na tions,\" said they, \" never spare the strangers; the Great River abounds in monsters, ready to swal low both men and canoes ; there are great cataracts and rapids, over which you will be dashed to pieces; the excessive heats will cause your death.\" \"I shall gladly lay down my life for the salvation of souls,\" replied the good man; and the docile nation joined him. On the 9th day of June, 1673, they reached the village on Fox River, where were Kickapoos, Mascoutins and Miamis dwelling together on an expanse of lovely prairie, dotted here and there by groves of magnificent trees, and where was a cross garlanded by wild flowers, and bows and ar rows, and skins and belts, offerings to the Great Manitou. Allouez had been here in one of his wanderings, and, as was his wont, had lest this emblem of his faith. Assembling the natives, Marquette said, \" My companion is an envoy of France to discover new countries ; and I am an embassador from God to enlighten them with the Gospel.\" Offering pres- ents, he begged two guides for the morrow. The Indians answered courteously, and gave in return a mat to serve as a couch during the long voyage. Early in the morning of the next day, the 10th of June, with all nature in her brightest robes, these two men, with five Frenchmen and two Al- gonquin guides, set out on their journey. Lifting two canoes to their shoulders, they quickly cross the narrow portage dividing the Fox from the Wisconsin River, and prepare to embark on its clear waters. \"Uttering a special prayer to the Immaculate Virgin, they leave the stream, that, flowing onward, could have borne their greetings to the castle of Quebec. 'The guides returned,' says the gentle Marquette, 'leaving us alone in this unknown land, in the hand of Providence.' France and Christianity stood alone in the valley of the Mississippi. Embarking on the broad Wisconsin, the discoverers, as they sailed west, went solitarily down the stream between alternate prairies and hillsides, beholding neither man nor the wonted beasts of the forests; no sound broke the silence but the ripple of the canoe and the lowing of the buffalo. In seven days, ' they en- tered happily the Great River, with a joy that could not be expressed ; ' and the two birchbark canoes, raising their happy sails under new skies and to unknown breezes, floated down the calm magnificence of the ocean stream, over the broad, clear sand-bars, the resort of innumerable water- fowl \u2014 gliding past islets that swelled from the bosom of the stream, with their tufts of massive thickets, and between the wild plains of Illinois and Iowa, all garlanded with majestic forests, or checkered by island groves and the open vastness of the prairie.\"* Continuing on down the mighty stream, they saw no signs of human life until the 25th of June, when they discovered a small foot-path on the west bank of the river, leading away into the prairie. Leaving their companions in the canoes, Marquette and Joliet followed the path, resolved to brave a meeting alone with the savages. After a walk of six miles they came in sight of a village on the banks of a river, while not far away they discovered two others. The river was the \" Mou in-gou-e-na,\" or Moingona, now corrupted into Des Moines. These two men, the first of their race who ever trod the soil west of the Great * Bancroft."], [35, "23 HISTORY OF OHIO. Remaining here till the next day, they are escorted for eight or ten leagues to the village of Akansea. They are now at the limit of their voyage. The Indians speak a dialect unknown to them. The natives show furs and axes of steel, the latter prov ing they have traded with Europeans. The two travelers now learn that the Father of Wa ters went neither to the Western sea nor to the Florida coast, but straight south, and conclude not to encounter the burning heats of a tropical clime, but return and find the outlet again. They had done enough now, aud must report their dis covery. On the 1 7th day of July, 1673, one hundred and thirty-two years after the disastrous journey of De Soto, which led to no permanent results, Marquette and Joliet left the village of Akansea on their way back. At the 38th degree, they en counter the waters of the Illinois which they had before noticed, and which the natives told them afforded a much shorter route to the lakes. Pad dling up its limpid waters, they see a country un surpassed in beauty. Rroad prairies, beautiful up lands, luxuriant groves, all mingled in excellent harmony as they ascend the river. Near the head of the river, they pause at a great village of the Illinois, and across the river behold a rocky prom ontory standing boldly out against the landscape. The Indians entreat the gentle missionary to re main among them, and teach them the way of life. He cannot do this, but promises to return when he can and instruct them. The town was on a plain near the present village of Utica, in La Salle County, 111., and the rock was Starved Rock, afterward noted in the annals of the Northwest. One of the chiefs and some young men conduct the party to the Chicago River, where the present mighty city is, from where, continuing their jour ney along the western shores of the lake, they reach Green Ray early in September. The great valley of the West was now open. The \"Messippi\" rolled its mighty flood to a south ern sea, and must be sully explored. Marquette's health had keenly suffered by the voyage and he concluded to remain here and rest. Joliet hasten ed on to Quebec to report his discoveries. During the journey, each had preserved a description of the route they had passed over, as well as the country and its inhabitants. While on the way to Quebec, at the foot of the rapids near Montreal, by some means one of Joliet's canoes became cap sized, and by it he lost his box of papers and two of his men. A greater calamity could have River, commended themselves to God, and, uttering a loud cry, advanced to the nearest village. The Indians hear, and thinking their visitors celestial beings, four old men advance with rever ential mien, and offer the pipe of peace. \" We are Illinois,\" said they, aud they offered the calu met. They had heard of the Frenchmen, and welcomed them to their wigwams, followed by the devouring gaze of an astonished crowd. At a great council held soon after, Marquette published to them the true God, their Author. He also spoke of his nation and of his King, who had chastised the Five Nations and commanded peace. He questioned them concerning the Great River and its tributaries, and tho tribes dwelling on its banks. A magnificent feast was spread before them, and the conference continued several days. At the close of the sixth day, the chieftains of the tribes, with numerous trains of warriors, attended the visitors to their canoes, and selecting a peace pipe, gayly caparisoned, they hung the sacred calumet, emblem of peace to all and a safeguard among the nations, about the good Father's neck, and bid the strangers good speed. \"I did not fear death,\" writes Marquette ; \" I should have esteemed it the greatest happiness to have died for the glory of God.\" On their journey, they passed the perpendicular rocks, whose sculptured sides showed them the monsters they should meet. Farther down, they pass the turgid flood of the Missouri, known to them by its Algonquin name, Pekitanoni. Resolving in his heart to one day explore its flood, Marquette rejoiced in the new world it evidently could open to him. A little farther down, they pass the bluffs where now is a mighty emporium, then silent as when created. In a little less than forty leagues, they pass the clear waters of the beautiful Ohio, then, and long after ward, known as the Wabash. Its banks were in habited by numerous villages of the peaceful Shawanees, who then quailed under the incursions of the dreadful Iroquois. As they go on down the mighty stream, the canes become thicker, the insects more fierce, the heat more intolerable. The prairies and their cool breezes vanish, and forests of white wood, admirable for their vastness and height, crowd close upon the pebbly shore. It is observed that the Chickasaws have guns, and have learned how to use them. Near the latitude of 33 degrees, they encounter a great village, whose inhabitants pre sent an inhospitable and warlike front. The pipe of peace is held aloft, and instantly the savage foe drops his arms and extends a friendly greeting."], [36, "24 HISTORY OF OHIO. hardly happened him. In a letter to Gov. Frontenac, Joliet says : \" I had escaped every peril from the Indians ; I had passed forty-two rapids, and was on the point of disembarking, full of joy at the success of so long and difficult an enterprise, when my canoe capsized after all the danger seemed over. I lost my two men and box of papers within sight of the French settlements, which I had lest almost two years before. Nothing remains now to me but my life, and the ardent desire to employ it in any service you may please to direct.\" When Joliet made known his discoveries, a Te Deum was chanted in the Cathedral at Quebec, and all Canada was filled with joy. The news crossed the ocean, and the French saw in the vista of coming years a vast dependency arise in the val ley, partially explored, which was to extend her domain and enrich her treasury. Fearing En gland might profit by the discovery and claim the country, she attempted as far as possible to prevent the news from becoming general. Joliet was re warded by the gift of the Island of Anticosti, in the St. Lawrence, while Marquette, conscious of his service to his Master, was content with the salvation of souls. Marquette, left at Green Ray, suffered long with his malady, and was not permitted, until the au tumn of the following year (1674), to return and teach the Illinois Indians. With this purpose in view, he left Green Ray on the 25th of October with two Frenchmen and a number of Illinois and Pottawatomie Indians for the villages on the Chicago and Illinois Rivers. Entering Lake Michigan, they encountered adverse winds and waves and were more than a month on the way. Going some distance up the Chicago River, they found Marquette too weak to proceed farther, his malady having assumed a violent form, and land ing, they erected two huts and prepared to pass the winter. The good missionary taught the na tives here daily, in spite of his afflictions, while his companions supplied him and themselves with food by fishing and hunting. Thus the winter wore away, and Marquette, renewing his vows, pre pared to go on to the village at the foot of the rocky citadel, where he had been two years before. On the 13th of March, 1675, they left their huts and, rowing on up the Chicago to the portage be tween that and the Desplaines, embarked on their way. Amid the incessant rains of spring, they were rapidly borne down that stream to the Illi- nois, on whose rushing flood they floated to the object of their destination. At the great town the missionary was received as a heavenly messenger, and as he preached to them of heaven and hell, of angels and demons, of good and bad deeds, they regarded him as divine and besought him to remain among them. The town then contained an immense concourse of natives, drawn hither by the reports they heard, and assembling them before him on the plain near their village, where now are pros perous farms, he held before their astonished gaze four large pictures of the Holy Virgin, and daily harangued them on the duties of Christianity and the necessity of conforming their conduct to the words they heard. His strength was fast declining and warned him he could not long remain. Find ing he must go, the Indians furnished him an escort as far as the lake, on whose turbulent waters he embarked with his two faithful attendants. They turned their canoes for the Mackinaw Mis sion, which the afflicted missionary hoped to reach before death came. As they coasted along the eastern shores of the lake, the vernal hue of May began to cover the hillsides with robes of green, now dimmed to the eye of the departing Father, who became too weak to view them. By the 19th of the month, he could go no farther, and requested his men to land and build him a hut in which he might pass away. That done, he gave, with great composure, directions concerning his burial, and thanked God that he was permitted to die in the wilderness in the midst of his work, an unshaken believer in the faith he had so earnestly preached. As twilight came on, he told his weary attendants to rest, promising that when death should come he would call them. At an early hour, on the morn ing ofthe 20th of May, 1675, they heard a feeble voice, and hastening to his side found that the gen tle spirit ofthe good missionary had gone to heav en. His hand grasped the crucifix, and his lips bore as their last sound the name of the Virgin. They dug a grave near the banks of the stream and buried him as he had requested. There in a lonely wilderness the peaceful soul of Marquette had at last found a rest, and his weary labors closed. His companions went on to the mission, where the news of his death caused great sorrow, for he was one beloved by all. Three years after his burial, the Ottawas, hunting in the vicinity of his grave, determined to carry his bones to the mission at their home, in accor dance with an ancient custom of their tribe. Hav ing opened the grave, at whose head a cross had been planted, they carefully removed the bones and"], [37, "25 HISTORY OF OHIO. cleaning them, a funeral procession of thirty canoes bore them to the Mackinaw Mission, singing the songs he had taught them. At the shores of the mission the bones were received by the priests, and, with great ceremony, buried under the floor ofthe rude chapel. While Marquette and Joliet were exploring the head-waters of the \"Great River,\" another man, fearless in purpose, pious in heart, and loyal to his country, was living in Canada and watching the operations of his fellow countrymen with keen eyes. When the French first saw the in hospitable shores of the 8t. Lawrence, in 1535, under the lead of Jacques Cartier, and had opened a new country to their crown, men were not lacking to further extend the discovery. In 1608, Champlain came, and at the foot of a cliff on that river founded Quebec. Seven years after, he brought four Recollet monks ; and through them and the Jesuits the discoveries already narrated occurred. Champlain died in 1635, one hundred years after Cartier's first visit, but not until he had explored the northern lakes as far as Lake Huron, on whose rocky shores he, as the progenitor of a mighty race to follow, set his feet. He, with others, held to the idea that somewhere across the country, a river highway extended to the Western ocean. The reports from the missions whose history has been given aided this belief; and not until Marquette and Joliet returned was the delu sion in any way dispelled. Before this was done, however, the man to whom reference has been made, Robert Cavalier, better known as La Salle, had endeavored to solve the mystery, and, while living on his grant of land eight miles above Montreal, had indeed effected important discoveries. La Salle, the next actor in the field of explor ation after Champlain, was born in 1643. His father's family was among the old and wealthy burghers of Rouen, France, and its members were frequently entrusted with important govern mental positions. He early exhibited such traits of character as to mark him among his associates. Coming from a wealthy family, he enjoyed all the advantages of his day, and received, for the times, an excellent education. He was a Catholic, though his subsequent life does not prove him to have been a religious enthusiast. From some cause, he joined the Order of Loyola, but the cir cumscribed sphere of action set for him in the order illy concurred with his independent dis position, and led to his separation from it. This was effected, however, in a good spirit, as they considered him fit for a different field of action than any presented by the order. Having a brother in Canada, a member of the order of St. Sulpice, he determined to join him. By his connection with the Jesuits he had lost his share of his father's estate, but, by some means, on his death, which occurred about this time, he was given a small share; and with this, in 1666, he arrived in Montreal. All Canada was alive with the newS of the explorations; and La Salle's mind, actively grasping the ideas he afterward carried out, began to mature plans for their perfection. At Montreal he found a semi nary of priests of the St. Sulpice Order who were encouraging settlers by grants of land on easy terms, hoping to establish a barrier of settlements between themselves and the Indians, made ene mies to the French by Champlain's actions when founding Quebec. The Superior of the seminary, learning of La Salle's arrival, gratuitously offered him a grant of land on the St. Lawrence, eight miles above Montreal. The grant, though danger ously near the hostile Indians, was accepted, and LaSalle soon enjoyed an excellent trade in furs. While employed in developing his claim, he learned of the great unknown route, and burned with a desire to solve its existence. He applied himself closely to the study of Indian dialects, and in three years is said to have made great progress in their language. While on his farm his thoughts often turned to the unknown land away to the west, and, like all men of his day, he desired to explore the route to the Western sea, and thence obtain an easy trade with China and Japan. The \" Great River, which flowed to the sea,\" must, thought they, find an outlet in the Gulf of California. While musing on these things, Marquette and Joliet were preparing to descend the Wisconsin; and LaSalle himself learned from a wandering band of Seneeas that a river, called the Ohio, arose in their country and flowed to the sea, but at such a distance that it would require eight months to reach its mouth. This must be the Great River, or a part of it : for all geographers of the day considered the Mississippi and its tributary as one stream. Plac ing great confidence on this hypothesis, La Salle repaired to Quebec to obtain the sanction of Gov. Courcelles. His plausible statements soon won him the Governor and M. Talon, and letters patent were issued granting the exploration. No pecuniary aid was offered, and La Salle, hav ing expended all his means in improving his"], [38, "2G HISTORY OF OHIO. would guide them there. While preparing to commence the journey, they heard of the missions to the northwest, and the priests resolved to go there and convert the natives, and find the river by that route. It appears that Louis Joliet met them here, on his return from visiting the copper mines of Lake Superior, under command of M. Talon. He gave the priests a map of the country, and informed them that the Indians of those regions were in great need of spiritual advisers. This strengthened their intention, though warned by La Salle, that the Jesuits were undoubtedly there. The authority for Joliet's .visit to them here is not clearly given, and may not be true, but the same letter which gives the account of the discovery of the Ohio at this time by La Salle, states it as a fact, and it is hence inserted. The missionaries and La Salle separated, the former to find, as he had predicted, the followers of Loyola already in the field, and not wanting their aid. Hence they return from a fruitless tour. La Salle,-now left to himself and just recovering from a violent fever, went on his journey. From the paper from which these statements are taken, it appears he went on to Onondaga, where he pro cured guides to a tributary of the Ohio, down which he proceeded 'to the principal stream, on whose bosom he continued his way till he came to the falls at the present city of Louisville, Ky. It has been asserted that he went on down to its mouth, but that is not well authenticated and is hardly true. The statement that he went as far as the falls is, doubtless, correct. He states, in a letter to Count Frontenac in 1677, that he discovered the Ohio, and that he descended it to the falls. Moreover, Joliet, in a measure his rival, for he was now preparing to go to the northern lakes and from them search the river, made two maps repre senting the lakes and the Mississippi, on both of which he states that La Salle had discovered the Ohio. Of its course beyond the falls, La Salle does not seem to have learned anything definite, hence his discovery did not in any way settle the great question, and elicited but little comment. Still, it stimulated La Salle to more effort, and while musing on his plans, Joliet and Marquette push on from Green Bay, and discover the river and ascertain the general course of its outlet. On Joliet's return in 1673, he seems to drop from further notice. Other and more venturesome souls were ready to finish the work begun by himself and the zealous Marquette, who, left among the far-away nations, laid down his life. The spirit of estate, was obliged to sell it to procure the necessary outfit. The Superior of the seminary being favorably disposed toward him, purchased the greater part of his improvement, and realiz ing 2,800 livres, he purchased four canoes and the necessary supplies for the expedition. The semi nary was, at the same time, preparing for a similar exploration. The priests of this order, emulating the Jesuits, had established missions on the north ern shore of Lake Ontario. Hearing of populous tribes still further west, they resolved to attempt their conversion, and deputized two of their number for the purpose. On going to Quebec to procure the necessary supplies, they were advised of La Salle's expedition down the Ohio, and resolved to unite themselves with it. La Salle did not alto gether favor their attempt, as he believed the Jesuits already had the field, and would not care to have any aid from a rival order. His dispo sition also would not well brook the part they assumed, of asking him to be a co-laborer rather than a leader. However, the expeditions, merged into one body, left the mission on the St. Law rence on the 6th of July, 1669, in seven canoes. The party numbered twenty-four persons, who were accompanied by two canoes filled with Indians who had visited La Salle, and who now acted as guides. Their guides led them up the St. Lawrence, over the expanse of Lake Ontario, to their village on the banks of the Genesee, where they expected to find guides to lead them on to the Ohio. As La Salle only partially under stood their language, he was compelled to confer with them by means of a Jesuit stationed at the village. The Indians refused to furnish him the expected aid, and even burned before his eyes a prisoner, the only one who could give him any knowledge he desired. He surmised the Jesuits were at the bottom of the matter, fearful lest the disciples of St. Sulpice should gain a foothold in the west. He lingered here a month, with the hope of accomplishing his object, when, by chance, there came by an Iroquois Indian, who assured them that at his colony, near the head of the lake, they could find guides ; and offered to conduct them thither. Coming along the southern shore of the lake, they passed, at its western extremity, the mouth of the Niagara River, where they heard for the first time the thundei* of the mighty cata ract between the two lakes. At the village of the Iroquois they met a friendly reception, and were informed by a Shawanese prisoner that they could reach the Ohio in six weeks' time, and that he"], [39, ""], [40, ""], [41, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 29 La Salle was equal to the enterprise, and as he now had returned from one voyage of discovery, he stood ready to solve the mystery, and gain the country for his King. Before this could be ac complished, however, he saw other things must be done, and made preparations on a scale, for the time, truly marvelous. Count Frontenac, the new Governor, had no sooner established himself in power than he gave a searching glance over the new realm to see if any undeveloped resources lay yet unnoticed, and what country yet remained open. He learned from the exploits of La Salle on the Ohio, and from Joliet, now returned from the West, of that immense country, and resolving in his mind on some plan whereby it could be formally taken, entered heartily into the plans of La Salle, who, anxious to solve the mystery concerning the outlet of the Great River, gave him the outline of a plan, saga cious in its conception and grand in its compre hension. LaSalle had also informed him of the endeavors of the English on the Atlantic coast to divert the trade with the Indians, and partly to counteract this, were the plans of La Salle adopted. They were, briefly, to build a chain of forts from Canada, or New France, along the lakes to the Mississippi, and on down that river, thereby hold ing the country by power as well as by discovery. A fort was to be built on the Ohio as soon as the means could be obtained, and thereby hold that country by the same policy. Thus to La Salle alone may be ascribed the bold plan of gaining the whole West, a plan only thwarted by the force of arms. Through the aid of Frontenac, he was given a proprietary and the rank of nobility, and on his proprietary was erected a fort, which he, in honor of his Governor, called Fort Frontenac. It stood on the site of the present city of Kingston, Canada. Through it he obtained the trade of the Five Nations, and his fortune was so far assured. He next repaired to France, to perfect his arrange ments, secure his title and obtain means. On his return he built the fort alluded to, and prepared to go on in the prosecution of his plan. A civil discord arose, however, which for three years prevailed, and seriously threatened his projects. As soon as he could extricate himself, he again repaired to France, receiving additional encouragement in money, grants, and the exclusive privilege of a trade in buffalo skins, then consid ered a source of great wealth. On his return, he was accompanied by Henry Tonti, son of an illus trious Italian nobleman, who had fled from his own country during one of its political revolutions. Coming to France, he made himself famous as the founder of Tontine Life Insurance. Henry Tonti possessed an indomitable will, and though he had suffered the loss of one of his hands by the ex plosion of a grenade in one of the Sicilian wars, his courage was undaunted, and his ardor un dimmed. La Salle also brought recruits, mechanics, sailors, cordage and sails for rigging a ship, and merchandise for traffic with the natives. At Montreal, he secured the services of M. LaMotte, a person of much energy and integrity of character. He also secured several missionaries before he reached Fort Frontenac. Among them were Louis Hennepin, Gabriel Ribourde and Zenabe Membre. All these were Flemings, all Recollets. Hennepin, of all of them, proved the best assist ant. They arrived at the fort early in the autumn of 1678, and preparations were at once made to erect a vessel in which to navigate the lakes, and a fort at the mouth of the Niagara River. The Seneeas were rather adverse to the latter proposals when La Motte and Hennepin came, but by the eloquence of the latter, they were pacified and rendered friendly. After a number of vexa tious delays, the vessel, the Griffin, the first on the lakes, was built, and on the 7th of August, a year after La Salle came here, it was launched, passed over the waters of the northern lakes, and, after a tempestuous voyage, landed at Green Bay. It was soon after stored with furs and sent back, while La Salle and his men awaited its return. It was never afterward heard of. La Salle, becoming impatient, erected a fort, pushed on with a part of his men, leaving part at the fort, and passed over the St. 'Joseph and Kankakee Rivers, and thence to the Illinois, down whose flood they proceeded to Peoria Lake, where he was obliged to halt, and return to Canada for more men and supplies. He left Tonti and several men to complete a fort, called Fort \" Crevec\u0153ur \" \u2014 broken-hearted. The Indians drove the French away, the men mutinied, and Tonti was obliged to flee. When La Salle returned, he found no one there, and going down as far as the mouth of the Illinois, he retraced his steps, to find some trace of his garrison. Tonti was found safe among the Pottawatomies at Green Bay, and Hennepin and his two followers, sent to explore the head-waters of the Mississippi, were again home, after a captivity among the Sioux. La Salle renewed his force of men, and the third time set out for the outlet of the Great River."], [42, "30 HISTORY OF OHIO. He left Canada early in December, 1681, and by February 6, 1682, reached the majestic flood of the mighty stream. On the 24th, they ascended the Chickasaw Bluffs, and, while waiting to find a sailor who had strayed away, erected Fort Prud honirue. They passed several Indian villages fur ther down the river, in some of which they met with no little opposition. Proceeding onward, ere long they encountered the tide of the sea, and April 6, they emerged on the broad bosom of the Gulf, \" tossing its restless billows, limitless, voice less and lonely as when born of chaos, without a sign of life.\" Coasting about a short time on the shores of the Gulf, the party returned until a sufficiently dry place was reached to effect a landing. Here another cross was raised, also a column, on which was inscribed these words: we have made alliance, either by ourselves or others in our behalf, as far as its mouth at the sea or Gulf of Mexico, about the twenty-seventh degree of its elevation of the North Pole, and also to the mouth of the River of Palms ; upon the assurance which we have received from all these nations that we are the first Europeans who have descended or ascended the river Colbert, hereby protesting against all those who may in future undertake to invade any or all of these countries, peoples or lands, to the prejudice of the right of His Majesty, acquired by the consent of the nations herein named.\" The whole assembly responded with shouts and the salutes of fire-arms. The Sieur de La Salle caused to be planted at the foot of the column a plate of lead, on one side of which was inscribed the arms of France and the following Latin inscrip tion: \" Louis le Grand, Roi de France et de Navarre, Regne; Le Neuviehe, Avril, 1682.\" * Robertvs Cavellier, cvm Domino de Tonly, Legato, R.

Thus was the foundation of France laid in the new republic, and thus did she lay claim to the Northwest, which now includes Ohio, and the county, whose history this book perpetuates. La Salle and his party returned to Canada soon after, and again that country, and France itself, rang with anthems of exultation. He went on to France, where he received the highest honors. He was given a fleet, and sailors as well as colon ists to return to the New World by way of a south ern voyage, expecting to find the mouth of the Mississippi by an ocean course. Sailing past the outlets, he was wrecked on the coast of Texas, and in his vain endeavors to find the river or return to Canada, he became lost on the plains of Arkansas, where he, in 1687, was basely murdered by one of hisfollowers. \" Youaredown now, Grand Bashaw,\" exclaimed his slayer, and despoiling his remains, they left them to be devoured by wild beasts. To such an ignominious end came this daring, bold adven turer. Alone in the wilderness, he was left, with no monument but the vast realm he had discov ered, on whose bosom he was left without cover ing and without protection. \" For force of will and vast conception ; for va rious knowledge, and quick adaptation of his genius \"In the name ofthe most high, mighty, invin cible and victorious Prince, Louis the Great, by the grace of God, King of France and of Navarre, Fourteenth of that name, thjs ninth day of April, one thousand six hundred and eighty two, I, in virtue ofthe commission of His Majesty, which I hold in my hand, and which may be seen by all whom it may concern, have taken, and do now take, in the name of His Majesty and of his suc cessors to the crown, possession of this country of Louisiana, the seas, harbor, ports, bays, adjacent straights, and all the nations, people, provinces, cities, towns, villages, mines, minerals, fisheries, streams and rivers, comprised in the extent of said Louisiana, from the north of the great river St. Louis, other wise called the Ohio, Alighin, Sipore or Chukago na, and this with the consent of the Chavunons, Chickachaws, and other people dwelling therein, with whom we have made alliance; as also along the river Colbert or Mississippi, and rivers which discharge themselves therein from its source beyond the Kious or Nadouessious, and this with their consent, and with the consent of the Illinois, Mes igameas, Natchez, Koroas, which are the most con siderable nations dwelling therein, with whom also * Louis the Great, King of France and of Navarre, reigning tbe ninth day of April, 1682."], [43, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 31 to untried circumstances; for a sublime magnani mity, that resigned itself to the will of Heaven, and yet triumphed over affliction by energy of purpose and unfaltering hope \u2014 he had no superior among his countrymen.

Yet the tide of battle wa vered. In 1689, the French were defeated at Walcourt, and the Turks at Widin ; but in 169(1, the French were victorious at Charleroy, and the Turks at Belgrade. The next year, and also the next, victory inclined to the French, but in 1693, Louvois and Luxemberg were dead and Namur surrendered to the allies. The war extended to the New World, where it was maintained with more than equal success by the French, though the En glish population exceeded it more than twenty to one. In 1688, the French were estimated at about twelve thousand souls in North America, while the English were more than two hundred thousand. At first the war was prosecuted vigorously. In 1689, De. Ste. Helone and DTberville, two ofthe sons of Charles le Mome, crossed the wilderness and reduced the English forts on Hudson's Bay. But in August of the same year, the Iroquois, the hereditary foes ofthe French, captured and burned Montreal. Frontenac, who had gone on an ex pedition against New York by sea, was recalled. Fort Frontenac was abandoned, and no French posts left in the West between Trois Rivieres and Mackinaw, and were it not for the Jesuits the en tire West would now have been abandoned. To recover their influence, the French planned three expeditions. One resulted in the destruction of Schenect'ady, another, Salmon Falls, and the third, Casco Bay. On the other hand, Nova Scotia was reduced by the colonies, and an expedition against Montreal went as far as to Lake Champlain, where it failed, owing to the dissensions of the leaders. Another expedition, consisting of twenty-four ves sels, arrived before Quebec, which also failed through the incompetency of Sir William Phipps. During the succeeding years, various border con flicts occurred, in all of which border scenes of savage cruelty and savage ferocity were enacted. The peace of Ryswick, in 1697, closed the war. France retained Hudson's Bay, and all the places of which she was in possession in 1688; but the boundaries ofthe English and French claims in the New World were still unsettled. Avarice, passion and jealousy were not calmed by the blood of La Salle. All of his conspirators per ished by ignoble deaths, while only seven ofthe six teen succeeded in continuing the journey until they reached Canada, and thence found their way to France. Tonti, who had been left at Fort St. Louis, on \" Starved Rock\" on the Illinois, went down in search of his beloved commander. Failing to find him, he returned and remained here until 1700, thousands of miles away from friends. Then he went down the Mississippi to join D'lberville, who had made the discovery of the mouth of the Mis sissippi by an ocean voyage. Two years later, he went on a mission to the Chickasaws, but of his subsequent history nothing is known. The West was now in possession of the French. La Salle's plans were yet feasible. The period of exploration was now over. The great river and its outlet was known, and it only remained for that nation to enter in and occupy what to many a Frenchman was the \"Promised Land.\" Only eighteen years had elapsed since Marquette and Joliet had descended the river and shown the course of its outlet. A spirit, less bold than La Salle's would never in so short a time have pene trated for more than a thousand miles an unknown wilderness, and solved the mystery of the world. When Joutel and his companions reached France in 1688, all Europe was on the eve of war. Other nations than the French wanted part of the New World, and when they saw that nation greedily and rapidly accumulating territory there, they en deavored to stay its progress. The league of Augs burg was formed in 1687 by the princes of the Em pire to restrain the ambition of Louis XIV, and in 1688, he began hostilities by the capture of Philipsburg. The next year, England, under the The conclusion of the conflict left the French at liberty to pursue their scheme of colonization in the Mississippi Valley. In 1698, DTberville was sent to the lower province, which, erelong, was made a separate independency, called Louisiana. * Bancroft."], [44, "32 HISTORY OF OHIO. Forts were erected on Mobile Bay, and the division of the territory between the French and the Spaniards was settled. Trouble existed between the French and the Chickasaws, ending in the cruel deaths of many of the leaders, in the fruitless endeavors of the Canadian and Louisi anian forces combining against the Chickasaws. For many years the conflict raged, with unequal successes, until the Indian power gave way before superior military tactics. In the end, New Orleans was founded, in 1718, and the French power secured. junction between it and the St. Mary's, which they followed to the \" Oubache \" \u2014 Wabash \u2014 and then to the French villages in Vigo and Knox Counties, in Indiana. Vincennes was the oldest and most important one here. It had been founded in 1702 by a French trader, and was, at the date of the establishment of the third route, in a prosperous condition. For many years, the traders crossed the plains of Southern Illinois to the French towns on the bottoms opposite St. Louis. They were afraid to go on down the \" Waba\" to the Ohio, as the Indians had fright ened them with accounts of the great monsters below. Finally, some adventurous spirit went down the river, found it emptied into the Ohio, and solved the problem of the true outlet of the Ohio, heretofore supposed to be a tributary of the Wabash. Before this was consummated, however, France became entangled in another war against the allied powers, ending in her defeat and the loss of Nova Scotia, Hudson's Bay and Newfound land. The peace of Utrecht closed the war in 1713. The French, weary with prolonged strife, adopted the plan, more peaceful in its nature, of giving out to distinguished men the monopoly of certain districts in the fur trade, the most pros perous of any avocation then. Crozat and Cadillac \u2014 the latter the founder of Detroit, in 1701 \u2014 were the chief ones concerned in this. The founding of the villages of Kaskaskia, Ca hokia, Vincennes, and others in the Mississippi and Wabash Valleys, led to the rapid develop ment, according to the French custom of all these parts of the West, while along all the chief water-courses, other trading posts and forts were established, rapidly fulfilling the hopes of La Salle, broached so many years before. The French had, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, four principal routes to their western tow-ns, two of which passed over the soil of Ohio. The first of these was the one followed by Marquette and Joliet, by way of the Lakes to Green Bay, in Wisconsin ; thence across a portage to the Wisconsin River, down which they floated to the Mississippi. On their return they came up the Illinois River, to the site of Chicago, whence Joliet returned to Quebec by the Lakes. La Salle's route was first by the Lakes to the St. Joseph's River, which he followed to the portage to the Kankakee, and thence downward to the Mississippi. On his second and third attempt, he crossed the lower peninsula of Michigan to the Kankakee, and again traversed its waters to the Illinois. The third route was established about 1716. It followed the southern shores of Lake Erie to the mouth of the Maumee River; following this stream, the voyagers went on to the The fourth route was from the southern shore of Lake Erie, at Presqueville, over a portage of 'fifteen miles to the head of French Creek, at Waterford, Penn. ; thence down that stream to the Ohio, and on to the Mississippi. Along all these routes, ports and posts were carefully maintained. Many were on the soil of Ohio, and were the first attempts of the white race to possess its domain. Many of the ruins of these posts are yet found on the southern shore of Lake Erie, and at the outlets of streams flowing into the lake and the Ohio River. The principal forts were at Mackinaw, at Presqueville, at the mouth of the St. Joseph's, on Starved Rock, and along the Father of Waters. Yet another power was encroaching on them : a sturdy race, clinging to the inhospitable Atlantic shores, were coming over the mountains. The murmurs of a conflict were already heard \u2014 a con- flict that would change the fate of a nation. The French were extending their explorations beyond the Mississippi; they were also forming a political organization, and increasing their influence over the natives. Of a passive nature, however, their power and their influence could not with- stand a more aggressive nature, and they were obliged, finally, to give way. They had the fruitful valleys of the West more than a century ; yet they developed no resources, opened no mines of wealth, and left the country as passive as they found it. Of the growth of the West under French rule, but little else remains to be said. The sturdy Anglo-Saxon race on the Atlantic coast, and their progenitors in England, began, now, to turn their attention to this vast country. The voluptuousness"], [45, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 33 mouth of the Huron River were abandoned before the war of the Revolution. On Lewis Evan's map of the Rritish Middle Colonies, published in 1755, a French fort, called \"Fort Junandat, built in 1754,\" is marked on the east bank of the San dusky River, several miles below its mouth. Fort Sandusky, on the western bank, is also noted. Several Wyandot towns are likewise marked. Rut very little is known concerning any of these trading-posts. They were, evidently, only tempo rary, and were abandoned when the English came into possession of the country. The mouth of the Cuyahoga River was another important place. On Evan's map there is marked on the west bank of the Cuyahoga, some distance from its mouth, the words \"French House\" doubt less, the station of a French trader. The ruins of a house, found about five miles from the mouth of the river, on the west bank, are supposed to be those of the trader's station. In 1786, the Moravian missionary, Zeisberger, with his Indian converts, left Detroit in a vessel called the Mackinaw, and sailed to the mouth of the Cuyahoga. From there they went up the river about ten miles, and settled in an abandoned Ottawa village, where Independence now is, which place they called \" Saint's Rest.\" Their stay was brief, for the following April, they left for the Huron River, and settled near the site of Milan, Erie County, at a locality they called New Salem. There are but few records of settlements made by the French until after 1750. Even these can hardly be called settlements, as they were simply trading-posts. The French easily affiliated with the Indians, and had little energy beyond trading. They never cultivated fields, laid low forests, and subjugated the country. They were a half-Indian race, so to speak, and hence did little if anything in developing the West. About \"1749, some English traders came to a place in what is now Shelby County, on the banks of a creek since known as Loramie's Creek, and established a trading-station with the Indians. This was the first English trading-place or attempt at settlement in the State. It was here but a short time, however, when the French, hear ing of its existence, sent a party of soldiers to the Twigtwees, among whom it was founded, and de manded the traders as intruders upon French ter ritory. The Twigtwees refusing to deliver up their friends, the French, assisted by a large party of Ottawas and Chippewas, attacked the trading house, probably a block-house, and, after a severe of the French court, their neglect, of the true basis of wealth, agriculture, and the repressive tendencies laid on the colonists, led the latter to adopt a hunter's life, and leave the country unde veloped and ready for the people who claimed the country from \"sea to sea.\" Their explorers were now at work. The change was at hand. Occasional mention has been made in the his tory of the State, in preceding pages, of settle ments and trading-posts of the French traders, explorers and missionaries, within the limits of Ohio. The French were the first white men to occupy the northwestern part of the New World, and though their stay was brief, yet it opened the way to a sinewy race, living on the shores of the Atlantic, who in time came, saw, and conquered that part of America, making it what the people of to-day enjoy. As early as 1669, four years before the discov ery of the Mississippi by Joliet and Marquette, La Salle, the famous explorer, discovered the Ohio River, and paddled down its gentle current as far as the falls at the present city of Louisville, but he, like others of the day, made no settlement on its banks, only claiming the country for his King by virtue of this discovery. Early in the beginning of the eighteenth cent ury, French traders and voyagers passed along the southern shores of Lake Erie, to the mouth of the Maumee, up whose waters they rowed their bark canoes, on their way to their outposts in the Wa bash and Illinois Valleys, established between 1675 and 1700. As soon as they could, without danger from their inveterate enemies, the Iroquois, masters of all the lower lake country, erect a trading-post at the mouth of this river, they did so. It was made a depot of considerable note, and was, probably, the first permanent habitation of white men in Ohio. It remained until after the peace of 1763, the termination of the French and Indian war, and the occupancy of this country by the English. On the site ofthe French trading post, the British, in 1794, erected Fort Miami, which they garrisoned until the country came under the control of Americans. Now, Maumee City covers the ground. The French had a trading-post at the mouth of the Huron River, in what is now Erie County. When it was built is not now known. It was, how ever, probably one of their early outposts, and may have been built before 1750. They had an other on the shore of the bay, on or near the site of Sandusky City. Both this and the one at the"], [46, "34 HISTORY OF OHIO. woods, with hazel undergrowth. Within this opening, a few hundred yards above the point, on the steep bank of the Auglaize, were five or six cabins and log houses, inhabited principally by Indian traders. The most northerly, a large hewed-log house, divided below into three apart ments, was occupied as a warehouse, store and dwelling, by George Ironside, the most wealthy and influential of the traders on the point. Next to his were the houses of Pirault (Pero) a French baker, and McKenzie, a Scot, who, in addition to merchandising, followed the occupation of a silver smith, exchanging with the Indians his brooches, ear-drops and other silver ornaments, at an enormous profit, for skin's and furs. Still further up were several other fami lies of French and English; and two Ameri can prisoners, Henry Rail, a soldier taken in St. Clair's defeat, and his wife, Polly Meadows, captured at the same time, were allowed to live here and pay their masters the price of their ransom \u2014 he, by boating to the rapids of the Mau mee, and she by washing and sewing. Fronting the house of Ironside, and about fifty yards from the bank, was a small stockade, inclosing two hewed-log houses, one of which was occupied by James Girty (a brother of Simon), the other, occasionally, by Elliott and McKee, British Indian Agents living at Detroit.\"* The post, cabins and all they contained fell under the control of the Americans, when the British evacuated the shores of the lakes. While they existed, they were an undoubted source of Indian discontent, and had much to do in prolonging the Indian war. The country hereabouts did not settle until some time after the creation of the State government. As soon as the French learned the true source of the Ohio and Wabash Rivers, both were made a highway to convey the products of their hunt ers. In coursing down the Ohio, they made trading-places, or depots, where they could obtain furs of the Indians, at accessible points, generally at the mouths of the rivers emptying into the Ohio. One of these old forts or trading-places stood about a mile and a half south of the outlet of the Scioto. It was here in 1740; but when it was erected no one could tell. The locality must have been pretty well known to the whites, however; for, in 1785, three years before the settlement of Marietta was made, four families * Narrative of 0. M. Spencer. battle, captured it. The traders were taken to Canada. This fort was called by the English \" Pickawillany,\" from which \"Piqua\" is probably derived. About the time that Kentucky was set tled, a Canadian Frenchman, named Loramie, established a store on the site of the old fort. He was a bitter enemy of the Americans, and for a long time Loramie's store was the headquarters of mischief toward the settlers. The French had the faculty of endearing them selves to the Indians by their easy assimilation of their habits; and, no doubt, Loramie was equal to any in this respect, and hence gained great influ ence over them. Col. Johnston, many years an Indian Agent from the United States among the Western tribes, stated that he had often seen the \"Indians burst into tears when speaking of the times when their French father had dominion over them; and their attachment always remained unabated.\" So much influence had Loramie with the In dians, that, when Gen. Clarke, from Kentucky, invaded the Miami Valley in 1782, his attention was attracted to the spot. He came on and burnt the Indian settlement here, and destroyed the store of the Frenchman, selling his goods among the men at auction. Loramie fled to the Shawanees, and, with a colony of that nation, emigrated west of the Mississippi, to the Spanish possessions, where he again began his life of a trader. In 1794, during the Indian war, a fort was built on the site of the store by Wayne, and named Fort Loramie. The last officer who had command here was Capt. Rutler, a nephew of Col. Richard Rutler, who fell at St. Clair's defeat. While here with his family, he lost an interesting boy, about eight years of age. About his grave, the sorrowing father and mother built a substantial picket-fence, planted honeysuckles over it, which, long after, remained to mark the grave of the soldier's boy. The site of Fort Loramie was always an im portant point, and was one of the places defined on the boundary line at the Greenville treaty. Now a barn covers the spot. At the junction of the Auglaize and Maumee Rivers, on the site of Fort Defiance, built by Gen. Wayne in 1794, was a settlement of traders, established some time before the Indian war began. \"On the high ground extending from the Maumee a quarter of a mile up the Auglaize, about two hundred yards in width, was an open space, on the west and south of which were oak"], [47, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 33 made an ineffectual attempt to settle near the same place. They were from Kentucky, but were driven away by the Indians a short time after they arrived, not being allowed to build cabins, and had only made preparations to plant corn and other necessaries of life. While the men were encamped near the vicinity of Piketown, in Pike County, when on a hunting expedition, they were surprised by the Indians, and two of them slain. The others hastened back to the encampment at the mouth of the Scioto, and hurriedly gathering the families together, fortu nately got them on a flat-boat, at that hour on its way down the river. By the aid of the boat, they were enabled to reach Maysville, and gave up the attempt to settle north of the Ohio. The famous \"old Scioto Salt Works,\" in Jack son County, on the banks of Salt Creek, a tributary of the Scioto, were long known to the whites before any attempt was made to settle in Ohio. They were indicated on the maps published in 1755. They were the resort, for generations, of the In dians in all parts of the West, who annually came here to make salt. They often brought white prisoners with them, and thus the salt works be came known. There were no attempts made to settle here, however, until after the Indian war, which closed in 1795. As soon as peace was as sured, the whites came here for salt, and soon after made a settlement. Another early salt spring was in what is now Trumbull County. It is also noted on Evan's map of 1755. They were occu pied by the Indians, French, and by the Americans as early as 1780, and perhaps earlier. As early as 1761 Moravian missionaries came among the Ohio Indians and began their labors. In a few years, under the lead of Revs. Fredrick Post and John Heckewelder, permanent stations were established in several parts of the State, chief ly on the Tuscarawas River in Tuscarawas County. Here were the three Indian villages \u2014 Shoenburn, Gnadenhutten and Salem. The site of the first is about two miles south of New Philadelphia ; Gna denhutten was seven miles further south, and about five miles still on was Salem, a short distance from the present village of Port Washington. The first and last named of these villages were on the west side of the Tuscarawas River, near the margin of the Ohio Canal. Gnadenhutten was on the east side of the river. It was here that the brutal massacre of these Christian Indians, by the rangers under Col. Williamson, occurred March 8, 1782. The account of the massacre and of these tribes appears in these pages, and it only remains to notice what became of them. The hospitable and friendly character of these Indians had extended beyond their white breth ren on the Ohio. The American people at large looked on the act of Williamson and his men as an outrage on humanity. Congress felt its influence, and gave them a tract of twelve thousand acres, embracing their former homes, and induced them to return from the northern towns whither they had fled. As the whites came into the country, their manners degenerated until it became necessary to remove them. Through Gen. Cass, of Michigan, an agreement was made with them, whereby Con gress paid them over $6,000, an annuity of $400* and 24,000 acres in some territory to be designated by the United States. This treaty, by some means, was never effectually carried out, and the princi pal part of them took up their residence near a Moravian missionary station on the River Thames, in Canada. Their old churchyard still exists on the Tuscarawas River, and here rest the bones of several of their devoted teachers. It is proper to remark here, that Mary Heckewelder, daughter of the missionary, is generally believed to have been the first white child born in Ohio. How ever, this is largely conjecture. Captive women among the Indians, before the birth of Mary Heckewelder, are known to have borne children, which afterward, with their mothers, were restored to their friends. The assertion that Mary Heckewelder was the first child born in Ohio, is therefore incorrect. She is the first of whom any definite record is made. These outposts are about all that are known to have existed prior to the settlement at Mari etta. About one-half mile below Rolivar, on the western line of Tuscarawas County, are the remains of Fort Laurens, erected in 1778, by a detachment of 1,000 men under Gen. Mc lntosh, from Fort Pitt. It was, however, occu pied but a short time, vacated in August, 1779, as it was deemed untenable at such a distance from the frontier. During the existence of the six years' Indian war, a settlement of French emigrants was made on the Ohio River, that deserves notice. It illus trates very clearly the extreme ignorance and credulity prevalent at that day. In May or June of 1788, Joel Rarlow left this country for Europe, \" authorized to dispose of a very large body of land in the West. \" In 1790, he distributed pro posals in Paris for the disposal of lands at five"], [48, "30 HISTORY OF OHIO. shillings per acre, which, says Volney, \" promised a climate healthy and delightful ; scarcely such a thing as a frost in the winter ; a river, called by way of eminence ' The Beautiful, ' abounding in fish of an enormous size ; magnificent forests of a tree from which sugar flows, and a shrub which yields candles ; venison in abundance ; no military enrollments, and no quarters to find for soldiers.\" Purchasers became numerous, individuals and whole families sold their property, and in the course of 1791 many embarked at the various French sea-ports, each with his title in his pocket. Five hundred settlers, among whom were many wood carvers and guilders to His Majesty, King of France, coachmakers, friseurs and peruke makers, and other artisans and artistes, equally well fitted for a frontier life, arrived in the United States in 1791-92, and acting without concert, traveling without knowledge of the language, customs and roads, at last managed to reach the spot designated for their residence. There they learned they had been cruelly deceived, and that the titles they held were worthless. Without food, shelterless, and danger closing around them, they were in a position that none but a Frenchman could be in without despair. Who brought them thither, and who was to blame, is yet a disputed point. Some affirm that those to whom large grants of land were made when the Ohio Company procured its charter, were the real instigators of the movement. They failed to pay for their lands, and hence the title reverted to the Government. This, coming to the ears of the poor Frenchmen, rendered their situation more distressing. They never paid for their lands, and only through the clemency of Congress, who aster ward gave them a grant of land, and confirmed them in its title, were they enabled to secure a foot hold. Whatever doubt there may be as to the causes of these people being so grossly deceived, there can be none regarding their sufferings. They had followed a jack-o-lantern into the howling wilderness, and must work or starve. The land upon which they had been located was covered with immense forest trees, to level which the coach makers were at a loss. At last, hoping to conquer by a coup de main, they tied ropes to the branches, and while a dozen pulled at them as many fell at the trunk with all sorts of edged tools, and thus soon brought the monster to the earth. Yet he was a burden. He was down, to be sure, but as much in the way as ever. Several lopped off the branches, others dug an immense trench at his side, into which, with might and main, all rolled the large log, and then buried him from sight. They erected their cabins in a cluster, as they had seen them in their own native land, thus affording some protection from marauding bands of Indians. Though isolated here in the lonely wilderness, and nearly out of funds with which to purchase pro visions from descending boats, yet once a week they met and drowned care in a merry dance, greatly to the wonderment of the scout or lone Indian who chanced to witness their revelry. Though their vivacity could work wonders, it would not pay for lands nor buy provisions. Some of those at Gallipolis (for such they called their settlement, from Gallia, in France) went to Detroit, some to Kaskaskia, and some bought land of the Ohio Company, who treated them liberally. Congress, too, in 1795, being informed of their sufferings, and how they had been deceived, granted them 24,000 acres opposite Little Sandy River, to which grant, in 1798, 12,000 acres more were added. The tract has since been known as French Grant. The settlement is a curious episode in early West ern history, and deserves a place in its annals."], [49, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 37 CHAPTER III. ENGLISH EXPLORATIONS\u2014 TRADERS\u2014 FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR IN THE WEST \u2014 ENGLISH POSSESSION. AS has been noted, the French title rested on the discoveries of their missionaries and traders, upon the occupation of the country, and upon the construction of the treaties of Ryswick, Utrecht and Aix la Chapelle. The English claims to the same region were based on the fact of a prior occupation of the corresponding coast, on an opposite construction of the same treaties, and an alleged cession of the rights of the Indians. The rights acquired by discovery were conventional, and in equity were good only between European powers, and could not affect the rights of the natives, but this distinction was dis regarded by all European powers. The inquiry of an Indian chief embodies the whole controversy: \"Where are the Indian lands, since the French claim all on the north side of the Ohio and the English all on the south side of it?\" The English charters expressly granted to all the original colonies the country westward to the South Sea, and the claims thus set up in the West, though held in abeyance, were never relinquished. The primary distinction between the two nations governed their actions in the New World, and led finally to the supremacy of the English. They were fixed agricultural communities. The French were mere trading-posts. Though the French were the prime movers in the exploration of the West, the English made discoveries during their occupation, however, mainly by their traders, who penetrated the Western wilderness by way of the Ohio River, entering it from the two streams which uniting form that river. Daniel Coxie, in 1722, published, in London, \"A description of the English province of Carolina, by the Spaniards called Florida, and by the French called La Louis iane, as also the great and famous river Mescha cebe, or Mississippi, the five vast navigable lakes of fresh water, and the parts adjacent, together with an account of the commodities of the growth and production of the said province.\" The title of this work exhibits very clearly the opinions of the English people respecting the West. As early as 1630, Charles I granted to Sir Robert Heath \" All that part of America lying between thirty- one and thirty-six degrees north latitude, from sea to sea,\" out of which the limits of Carolina were afterward taken. This immense grant was con veyed in 1638, to the Earl of Arundel, and after ward came into the possession of Dr. Daniel Coxie. In the prosecution of this claim, it appeared that Col. Wood, of Virginia, from 1654 to 1664, ex plored several branches ofthe Ohio and \"Mescha cebe,\" as they spell the Mississippi. A Mr. Need ham, who was employed by Col. Wood, kept a journal of the exploration. There is also the ac count of some one who had explored the Missis sippi to the Yellow, or Missouri River, before 1676. These, and others, are said to have been there when La Salle explored the outlet of the Great River, as he found tools among the natives which were of European manufacture. They had been brought here by English adventurers. Also, when Iberville was colonizing the lower part of Louis iana, these same persons visited the Chickasaws and stirred them up against the French. It is also stated that La Salle found that some one had been among the Natchez tribes when he returned from the discovery of the outlet of the Mississippi, and excited them against him. There is, however, no good authority for these statements, and they are doubtless incorrect. There is also an account that in 1678, several persons went from New England as far south as New Mexico, \" one hundred and fifty leagues beyond the Meschacebe,\" the narrative reads, and on their return wrote an account of the expedition. This, also, cannot be traced to good authority. The only accurate account of the English reaching the West was when Bienville met the British vessel at the \"English Turn,\" about 1700. A few of their traders may have been in the valley west of the Alleghany Mount ains before 1700, though no reliable accounts are now found to confirm these suppositions. Still, from the earliest occupation of the Atlantic Coast by the English, they claimed the country, and, though the\" policy of its occupation rested for a time, it was never fully abandoned. Its revival dates from 1710 properly, though no immediate endeavor was made for many years after. That"], [50, ":JS HISTORY OF OHIO. year, Alexander Spottswood was made Governor of Virginia. No sooner did he assume the functions of ruler, than, casting his eye over his dominion, he saw the great West beyond the Alleghany Mount ains unoccupied by the English, and rapidly filling with the French, who he observed were gradually confining the English to the Atlantic Coast. His prophetic eye saw at a glance the animus of the whole scheme, and he determined to act promptly on the defensive. Through his representation, the Virginia Assembly was induced to make an appro priation to defray the expense of an exploration of the mountains, and see if a suitable pass could not then be found where they could be crossed. The Governor led the expedition in person. The pass was discovered, a route marked out for future em igrants, and the party returned to Williamsburg. There the Governor established the order of the \"Knights of the Golden Horseshoe,\" presented his report to the Colonial Assembly and one to his King. In each report, he exposed with great bold ness the scheme of the French, and advised the building of a chain of forts across to the Ohio, and the formation of settlements to counteract them. The Rritish Government, engrossed with other matters, neglected his advice. Forty years after, they remembered it, only to regret that it was so thoughtlessly disregarded. Individuals, however, profited by his advice. Ry 1730, traders began in earnest to cross the mount ains and gather from the Indians the stores beyond. They now began to adopt a system, and abandoned the heretofore renegade habits of those who had superseded them, many of whom never returned to the Atlantic Coast. In 1742, John Howard de scended the Ohio in a skin canoe, and, on the Mississippi was taken prisoner by the French. His captivity did not in the least deter others from coming. Indeed, the date of his voyage was the commencement of a vigorous trade with the In dians by the English, who crossed the Alleghanies by the route discovered by Gov. Spottswood. In 1748, Conrad Weiser, a German of Herenberg, who had acquired in early life a knowledge of the Mo hawk tongue by a residence among them, was sent on an embassy to the Shawanees on the Ohio. He went as far as Logstown, a Shawanee village on the north bank of the Ohio, about seventeen miles be low the site of Pittsburgh. Here he met the chiefs in counsel, and secured their promise of aid against the French. The principal ground of the claims of the English in the Northwest was the treaty with the Five Nations \u2014 the Iroquois. This powerful confed eration claimed the jurisdiction over an immense extent of country. Their policy differed considera bly from other Indian tribes. They were the only confederation which attempted any form of gov ernment in America. They were often termed the \" Six Nations,\" as the entrance of another tribe into the confederacy made that number. They were the conquerors of nearly all tribes from Lower Canada, to and beyond the Mississippi. They only exacted, however, a tribute from the conquered tribes, leaving them to manage their own internal affairs, and stipulating that to them alone did the right of cession belong. Their country, under these claims, embraced all of America north of the Cherokee Nation, in Virginia; all Kentucky, and all the Northwest, save a district in Ohio and Indi ana, and a small section in Southwestern Illinois, claimed by the Miami Confederacy. The Iroquois, or Six Nations, were the terror of all other tribes. It was they who devastated the Illinois country about Rock Fort in 1680, and caused wide-spread alarm among all the Western Indians. In 1684, Lord Howard, Governor of Virginia, held a treaty with the Iroquois at Albany, when, at the request of Col. Duncan, of New York, they placed them selves under the protection of the English. They made a deed of sale then, by treaty, to the Rritish Government, of a vast tract of country south and east of the Illinois River, and extending into Can ada. In 1726, another deed was drawn up and signed by the chiefs of the national confederacy by which their lands were conveyed in trust to England, \" to be protected and defended by His Majesty, to and for the use of the grantors and their heirs.\"* If the Six Nations had a good claim to the West ern country, there is but little doubt but England was justified in defending their country against the French, as, by the treaty of Utrecht, they had agreed not to invade the lands of Rritain's Indian allies. This claim was vigorously contested by France, as that country claimed the Iroquois had no lawful jurisdiction over the West. In all the disputes, the interests of the contending nations was, however, the paramount consideration. The rights of the Indians were little regarded. The Rritish also purchased land by the treaty of Lancaster, in 1744, wherein they agreed to pay the Six Nations for land settled unlawfully in Pennsylvania, Virginia and Maryland. The In * Annals of the West."], [51, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 39 dians were given goods and gold amounting to near a thousand pounds sterling. They were also promised the protection of the English. Had this latter provision been faithfully carried out, much blood would have been saved in after years. The treaties with the Six Nations were the real basis of the claims of Great Britain to the West; claims that were only settled by war. The Shawanee In dians, on the Ohio, were also becoming hostile to the English, aud began to assume a threatening exterior. Peter Chartier, a half-breed, residing in Philadelphia, escaped from the authorities, those by whom he was held for a violation of the laws, and joining the Shawanees, persuaded them to join the French. Soon after, in 1743 or 1744, he placed himself at the head of 400 of their war riors, and lay in wait on the Alleghany River for the provincial traders. He captured two, exhib ited to them a captain's commission from the French, and seized their goods, worth \u00a31,600. The Indians, after this, emboldened by the aid given them by the French, became more and more hostile, and Weiser was again sent across the mount ains in 1748, with presents to conciliate them and sound them on their feelings for the rival nations, and also to see what they thought of a settlement of the English to be made in the West. The visit of Conrad Weiser was successful, and Thomas Lee, with twelve other Virginians, among whom were Lawrence and Augustine Washington, brothers of George Washington, formed a company which they styled the Ohio Company, and, in 1748, peti tioned the King for a grant beyond the mountains. The monarch approved the petition and the gov ernment of Virginia was ordered to grant the Com pany 500,000 acres within the bounds of that colony beyond the Alleghanies, 200,000 of which were to be located at once. This provision was to hold good for ten years, free of quit rent, provided tbe Company would settle 100 families within seven years, and build a fort sufficient for their protection. These terms the Company accepted, and sent at once to London for a cargo suitable for the Indian trade. This was the beginning of English Companies in the West; this one forming a prominent past in the history of Ohio, as will be seen hereafter. Others were also formed in Virginia, whose object was the colonization of the West. One of these, the Loyal Company, received, on the 12th of June, 1749, a grant of 800,000 acres, from the line of Canada on the north and west, and on the 29th of October, 1751, the Green briar Company received a grant of 100,000 acres. To these encroachments, the French were by no means blind. They saw plainly enough that if the English gained a foothold in the West, they would inevitably endeavor to obtain the country, and one day the issue could only be decided by war. Vaudreuil, the French Governor, had long anxiously watched the coming struggle. In 1774, he wrote home representing the consequences that would surely come, should the English succeed in their plans. The towns of the French in Illinois were producing large amounts of bread-stuffs and provisions which they sent to New Orleans. These provinces were becoming valuable, and must not be allowed to come under control of a rival power. In 1749, Louis Celeron was sent by the Governor with a party of soldiers to plant leaden plates, suit ably inscribed, along the Ohio at the mouths of the principal streams. Two of these plates were afterward exhumed. One was sent to the Mary land Historical Society, and the inscription* deci phered by De Witt Clinton. On these plates was clearly stated the claims of France, as will be seen from the translation below. England's claim, briefly and clearly stated, read as follows: \"That all lands, or countries west ward from the Atlantic Ocean to the South Sea, between 48 and 34 degrees of North Latitude, were expressly included in the grant of King James the First, to divers of his subjects, so long time since as the year 1606, and afterwards con firmed in the year 1620 ; and under this grant, the colony of Virginia claims extent so far west as the South Sea, and the ancient colonies of Mass achusetts Ray and Connecticut, were by their respective charters, made to extend to the said South Sea, so that not only the right to the sea coast, but to all the Inland countries from sea to sea, has at all times been asserted by the Crown of England.\"f To make good their titles, both nations were now doing their utmost. Professedly at peace, it only needed a torch applied, as it were, to any point, to instantly precipitate hostilities. The French were *The following is the translation of the inscription of the plate found at Venango : \" In the year 1749, reign of Louis XV. King of France, we, Celeron, commandant of a detachment by Monsieur the Marquis of Gallisoniere, Commander-in-chief of New France, to establish tranquillity in certain Indian villages in these Cantons, have buried this plate at the confluence of the Toraclakoin, this twenty-ninth of July, near the River Ohio, otherwise Beautiful River, as a monument of renewal of possession which we have taken of the said river, and all its tributaries; and of all the land on both Bides, as far as the sources of said river6; inasmuch as the preceding Kings of France have enjoyed it, and maintained it by their arms and by treaties ; especially by those of Ryswick, Utrecht, and Aix La Chapelle.\" \u2022( Colonial Records of Pennsylvania."], [52, "40 HISTORY OF OHIO. was part of the time among hostile tribes, who could have captured him and been well rewarded by the French Government. Rut Gist knew how to act, and was successful. While Gist was doing this, some English traders established themselves at a place in what is now known as Shelby County, Ohio, and opened a store for the purpose of trading with the Indians. This was clearly in the limits of the West, claimed by the French, and at once aroused them to action. The fort orstockade stood on the banks of Loramie's Creek, about sixteen miles northwest of the present city of Sydney. It received the name Loramie from the creek by the French, which received its name in turn from the French trader of that name, who had a trading-post on this creek. Loramie had fled to the Spanish country west of the Mississippi, and for many years was a trader there ; his store being at the junc tion of the Kansas and Missouri, near the present city of Kansas City, Mo. When the English traders came to Loramie's Creek, and erected their trading-place, they gave it the name of Pick awillany, from the tribe of Indians there. The Miami confederacy granted them this privilege as the result of the presents brought by Crogan and Gist. It is also asserted that Andrew Montour, a half-breed, son of a Seneca chief and the famous Catharine Montour, who was an important fac tor afterward in the English treaties with the Indians, was with them, and by his influence did much to aid in securing the privilege. Thus was established the first English trading-post in the Northwest Territory and in Ohio. It, however, enjoyed only a short duration. The French could not endure so clear an invasion of their country, and gathering a force of Ottawas and Chippewas, now their allies, they attacked the stockade in June, 1752. At first they demanded of the Miamis the surrender of the fort, as they were the real cause of its location, having granted the English the privilege. The Miamis not only refused, but aided the British in the defense. In the battle that ensued, fourteen of the Miamis were slain, and all the traders captured. One account says they were burned, another, and probably the correct one, states that they were taken to Canada as prisoners of war. It is probable the traders were from Penn sylvania, as that commonwealth made the Miamis presents as condolence for their warriors that were slain. Blood had now been shed. The opening gun of the French and Indian war had been fired, and both busily engaged erecting forts from the southern shores of Lake Erie to the Ohio, and on down in the Illinois Valley ; up at Detroit, and at all its posts, preparations were constantly going on for the crisis, now sure to come. The issue between the two governments was now fully made up. It ad mitted of no compromise but the sword. To that, however, neither power desired an immediate ap peal, and both sought rather to establish and fortify their interests, and to conciliate the Indian tribes. The English, through the Ohio Company, sent out Christopher Gist in the fall of 1750, to explore the regions west of the mountains. He was instructed to examine the passes, trace the courses of the rivers, mark the falls, seek for valuable lands, ob serve the strength, and to conciliate the friendship of the Indian tribes. He was well fitted for such an enterprise. Hardy, sagacious, bold, an adept in Indian character, a hunter by occupation, no man was better qualified than he for such an undertak ing. He visited Logstown, where he was jealously received, passed over to the Muskingum River and Valley in Ohio, where he found a village of Wyan dots, divided in sentiment. At this village he met Crogan, another equally famous frontiersman, who had been sent out by Pennsylvania. Together they held a council with the chiefs, and received assurance of the friendship of the tribe. This done, they passed to the Shawnee towns on the Scioto, received their assurances of friendship, and went on to the Miami Valley, which they crossed, remarking in Crogan's journal of its great fertili ty. They made a raft of logs on which they crossed the Great Miami, visited Piqua, the chief town of the Pickawillanies, and here made treaties with the Weas and Piankeshaws. While here, a deputation of the Ottawas visited the Miami Con federacy to induce them to unite with the French. They were repulsed through the influence of the English agents, the Miamis sending Gist word that they would \" stand like the mountains. \" Crogan now returned and published an account of their wanderings. Gist followed the Miami to its mouth, passed down the Ohio till within fifteen miles of the falls, then returned by way of the Kentucky River, over the highlands of Kentucky to Virginia, arriving in May, 1751. He had visited the Mingoes, Delawares, Wyandots, Shawa nees and Miamis, proposed a union among these tribes, and appointed a grand council to meet at Logstown to form an alliance among themselves and with Virginia. His journey was marvelous for the day. It was extremely hazardous, as he"], [53, "41 HISTORY OF OHIO. nations became more deeply interested in affairs in the West. The English were determined to secure additional title to the West, and, in 1752, sent Messrs. Fry, Lomax and Patton as commissioners to Logstown to treat with the Indians, and confirm the Lancaster treaty. They met the Indians on the 9th of June, stated their desires, and on the 11th received their answer. At first, the sav ages were not inclined to recognize the Lancaster treaty, but agreed to aid the English, as the French had already made war on the Twigtees (at Picka willany), and consented to the establishment of a fort and trading-post at the forks of the Ohio. This was not all the Virginians wanted, however, and taking aside Andrew Montour, now chief of the Six Nations, persuaded him to use his influence with the red men. By such means, they were in duced to treat, and on the 13th they all united in signing a deed, confirming the Lancaster treaty in its full extent, consenting to a settlement southwest of the Ohio, and covenanting that it should not be disturbed by them. By such means was obtained the treaty with the Indians in the Ohio Valley. All this time, the home governments were en deavoring to out-maneuver each other with regard to the lands in the West, though there the outlook only betokened war. The French understood bet ter than the English how to manage the Indians, and succeeded in attaching them firmly to their cause. The English were not honest in their actions with them, and hence, in after years, the massacres that followed. At the close of 1752, Gist was at work, in con formity with the Lancaster and Logstown treaties, laying out a fort and town on Chartier's Creek, about ten miles below the fork. Eleven families had crossed the mountains to settle at Gist's resi dence west of Laurel Hill, not far from the Yough iogheny. Goods had come from England for the Ohio Company, which were carried as far West as Will's Creek, where Cumberland now stands ; and where they were taken by the Indians and traders. On the other hand, the French were gathering cannon and stores on Lake Erie, and, without treaties or deeds of land, were gaining the good will of the inimical tribes, and preparing, when all was ready, to strike the blow. Their fortifications consisted of a chain of forts from Lake Erie to the Ohio, on the border. One was at Presque Isle, on the site of Erie ; one on French Creek, on the site of Waterford, Penn.; one at the mouth of French Creek, in Venango County, Penn.; while opposite it was another, effectually commanding that section of country. These forts, it will be observed, were all in the limits of the Pennsyl vania colony. The Governor informed the Assem bly of their existence, who voted \u00a3600 to be used in purchasing presents for the Indians near the forts, and thereby hold their friendship. Virginia, also, took similar measures. Trent was sent, with guns and ammunition and presents, to the friendly tribes, and, while on his mission, learned of the plates of lead planted by the French. In October, 1753, a treaty was consummated with representa tives of the Iroquois, Delawares, Shawanees, Twig twees and Wyandots, by commissioners from Pennsylvania, one of whom was the philosopher Franklin. At the conferences held at this time, the Indians complained of the actions of the French in forcibly taking possession of the dis puted country, and also bitterly denounced them for using rum to intoxicate the red men, when they desired to gain any advantage. Not long after, they had similar grounds of complaint against the English, whose lawless traders cared for nothing but to gain the furs of the savage at as little ex pense as possible. The encroachments of the French on what was regarded as English territory, created intense feel ing in the colonies, especially in Virginia. The purpose of the French to inclose the English on the Atlantic Coast, and thus prevent their extension over the mountains, became more and more ap parent, and it was thought that this was the open ing of a scheme already planned by the French Court to reduce all North America under the do minion of France. Gov. Dinwiddie determined to send an ambassador to the French posts, to as certain their real intentions and to observe the amount and disposition of their forces. He selected a young Virginian, then in his twenty-first year, a surveyor by trade and one well qualified for the duty. That young man afterward led the Ameri can Colonies in their struggle for liberty. George Washington and one companion, Mr Gist, suc cessfully made the trip, in the solitude of a severe winter, received assurance from the French com mandant that they would by no means abandon their outposts, and would not yield unless com pelled by force of arms. The commandant was exceedingly polite, but firm, and assured the young American that \"we claim the country on the Ohio by virtue of the discovery of La Salle (in 1669) aud will not give it up to the English. Our orders are to make prisoners of every Englishman found trading in the Ohio Valley.\""], [54, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 42 fortifications at the Fork. Swift feet had borne the news of it up the valley, and though Ensign Ward, left in command, felt himself secure, on the 17th of April he saw a sight that made his heart sick. Sixty batteaux and three hundred canoes were coming down the Alleghany. The com mandant sent him a summons, which evaded no words in its meaning. It was useless to contend, that evening he supped with his conqueror ; the next day he was bowed out by the polite French man, and with his men and tools marched up the Monongahela. The first birds of spring were fill ing the air with their song ; the rivers rolled by, swollen by April showers and melting snows; all nature was putting on her robes of green ; and the fortress, which the English had so earnestly strived to obtain and fortify, was now in the hands of the French. Fort Du Quesne arose on the incomplete fortifications. The seven years' war that followed not only affected America, but spread to all quar ters of the world. The war made England a great imperial power ; drove the French from Asia and America; dispelled the brilliant and extended scheme of Louis and his voluptuous empire. The active field of operations was in the Canadas principally, and along the western borders of Penn sylvania. There were so few people then in the present confines of Ohio, that only the possession of the country, in common with all the West, could be the animus of the conflict. It so much concerned this part of the New World, that a brief resume' of the war will be necessary to fully under stand its history. The fall of the post at the fork of the Ohio, Fort Du Quesne, gave the French control of the West. Washington went on with his few militia to re take the post. Though he was successful at first, he was in the end defeated, and surrendered, being allowed to return with all his munitions of war. The two governments, though trying to come to a peaceful solution of the question, were getting ready for the conflict. France went stead ily on, though at one time England gave, in a 'measure, her consent to allow the French to retain all the country west of the Alleghanies and south of the lakes. Had this been done, what a different future would have been in America ! Other des tinies were at work, however, and the plan fell stillborn. England sent Gen. Braddock and a fine force of men, who marched directly toward the post on the Ohio. His ill-fated expedition resulted only in the total defeat of his army, and his own death. During Washington's absence steps were taken to fortify the point formed by the junction of the Monongahela and Alleghany ; and when, on his return, he met seventeen horses loaded with mate rials and stores for a fort at the forks of the Ohio, and, soon after, some families going out to settle, he knew the defense had begun. As soon as Washington made his report, Gov. Dinwiddie wrote to the Board of Trade, stating that the French were building a fort at Venango, and that, in March, twelve or fifteen hundred men would be ready to descend the river with their Indian allies, for which purpose three hundred canoes had been collected ; and that Logstown was to be made headquarters, while forts were to be built in other places. He sent expresses to the Governors of Pennsylvania and New York, apprising them of the nature of affairs, and calling upon them for assist ance. He also raised two companies, one of which was raised by Washington, the other by Trent. The one under Trent was to be raised on the frontiers, and was, as soon as possible, to repair to the Fork and erect there a fort, begun by the Ohio Company. Owing to various' conflicting opinions between the Governor of Pennsylvania and his Assembly, and the conference with the Six Nations, held by New York, neither of those provinces put forth any vigorous measures until stirred to action by the invasions on the frontiers, and until directed by the Earl of Holderness, Secretary of State. The fort at Venango was finished by the French in April, 1754. All along the creek resounded the clang of arms and the preparations for war. New York and Pennsylvania, though inactive, and debating whether the French really had in vaded English territory or not, sent aid to the Old Dominion, now all alive to the conquest. The two companies had been increased to six; Washing ton was raised to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, and made second under command of Joshua Fry. Ten cannon, lately from England, were for warded from Alexandria ; wagons were got ready to carry westward provisions and stores through the heavy spring roads; and everywhere men were enlisting under the King's promise of two huudred thousand acres of land to those who would go. They were gathering along Will's Creek and far beyond, while Trent, who had come for more men and supplies, left a little band of forty-one men, working away in hunger and want at the Fork, to which both nations were looking with anxious eyes. Though no enemy was near, and only a few Indian scouts were seen, keen eyes had observed the low"], [55, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 43 Washington saved a remnant of the army, and made his way back to the colonies. The En glish needed a leader. They next planned four campaigns; one against Fort Du Quesne; one against Crown Point; one against Niagara, and one against the French settlements in Nova Scotia. Nearly every one proved a failure. The English were defeated on sea and on land, all owing to the incapacity of Parliament, and the want of a suit able, vigorous leader. The settlements on the front iers, now exposed to a cruel foe, prepared to defend themselves, and already the signs of a government of their own, able to defend itself, began to appear. They received aid from the colonies. Though the French were not repulsed, they and their red allies found they could not murder with impunity. Self-preservation was a stronger incen tive in conflict than aggrandizement, and the cruelty of the Indians found avengers. The great Pitt became Prime Minister June 29, 1757. The leader of the English now appeared. The British began to regain their losses on sea and land, and for them a brighter day was at hand. The key to the West must be retaken, and to Gen. Forbes was assigned the duty. Preceding him, a trusty man was sent to the Western Indians at the head-waters of the Ohio, and along the Mo nongahela and Alleghany, to see if some compro mise with them could not be made, and their aid secured. The French had been busy through their traders inciting the Indians against the English. The lawless traders were another source of trouble. Caring nothing for either nation, they carried on a distressing traffic in direct violation of the laws, continually engendering ill-feeling among the na tives. \"Your traders,\" said one of them, \"bring scarce anything but rum and flour. They bring little powder and lead, or other valuable goods. The rum ruins us. We beg you would prevent its coming in such quantities by regulating the traders. * * * These wicked whisky sell ers, when they have got the Indians in liquor, make them sell the very clothes off their backs. If this practice be continued, wemust be inevitably ruined. We most earnestly, therefore, beseech you to remedy it.\" They complained of the French traders the same way. They were also beginning to see the animus of the whole conflict. Neither power cared as much for them as for their land, and flattered and bullied by turns as served their purposes best. The man selected to go upon this undertaking was Christian Frederic Post, a Moravian, who had lived among the Indians seventeen years, and mar- ried into one of their tribes. He was amissionary, and though obliged to cross a country whose every stream had been dyed by blood, and every hillside rung with the death-yell, and grown red with the light of burning huts, he went willingly on his way. Of his journey, sufferings and doings, his own journal tells the story. He left Philadelphia on the 15th of July, 1758, and on the 7th of August safely passed the French post at Venango, went on to Big Beaver Creek, where he held a conference with the chiefs of the Indians gathered there. It was decided that a great conference should be held opposite Fort Du Quesne, where there were Indians of eight nations. \"We will bear you in our bosoms,\" said the natives, when Post expressed a fear that he might be delivered over to the French, and royally they fulfilled their promises. At the conference, it was made clear to Post that all the Western Indians were wavering in their allegiance to the French, owing largely to the fail ure of that nation to fulfill their promises of aid to prevent them from being deprived of their land by the Six Nations, and through that' confederacy, by the English. The Indians complained bitterly, more over, of the disposition of the whites in over-run ning and claiming their lands. \"Why did you not fight your battles at home or on the sea, instead of coming into our country to fight them?\" they asked again and again, and mournfully shook their heads when they thought of the future before them. \" Your heart is good,\" said they to Post. \" You speak sincerely ; but we know there is always a great number who wish to get rich ; they have enough ; look ! we do not want to be rich and take away what others have. The white people think we have no brains in our heads ; that they are big, and we are a handful ; but remember when you hunt for a rattlesnake, you cannot always find it, and perhaps it will turn and bite you before you see it.\"* When the war of Pontiac came, and all the West was desolated, this saying might have been justly remembered. After concluding a peace, Post set out for Philadelphia, and after incredi ble hardships, reached the settlement uninjured early in September. His mission had more to do than at first is apparent, in the success of the English. Had it not been for him, a second Brad dock's defeat might have befallen Forbes, now on his way to subjugate Fort Du Quesne. Through the heats of August, the army hewed its way toward the West. Early in September it * Post's Journal."], [56, "HISTORY OF OHIO. u supposition that a garrison had been massacred there. The French, though deprived of the key to the West, went on preparing stores and ammunition, expecting to retake the fort in the spring. Before they could do this, however, other places demanded their attention. The success of the campaign of 1758 opened the way for the consummation of the great scheme of Pitt \u2014 the complete reduction of Canada. Three expeditions were planned, by which Canada, already well nigh annihilated and suffering for food, was to be subjugated. On the west, Prideaux was to attack Niagara ; in the center, Amherst was to advance on Ticonderoga and Crown Point ; on the east, Wolfe was to besiege Quebec. All these points gained, the three armies were to be united in the center of the province. Amherst appeared before Ticonderoga July 22. The French blew up their works, and retired to Crown Point. Driven from there, they re treated to Isle Aux Nois and entrenched them selves. The lateness of the season prevented fur ther action, and Amherst went into winter quar ters at Crown Point. Early in June, Wolfe appeared before Quebec with an army of 8,000 men. On the night of September 12, he silently ascended the river, climbed the heights of Abra ham, a spot considered impregnable by the French, and on the summit formed his army of 5,000 men. Montcalm, the French commander, was compelled to give battle. The British col umns, flushed with success, charged his half-formed lines, and dispersed them. \"They fly! they fly!\" heard Wolfe, just as he expired from the effect of a mortal wound, though not till he had ordered their retreat cut off, and exclaimed, \"Now, God be praised, I die happy.\" Montcalm, on hearing from the surgeon that death would come in a few hours, said, \"I am glad of it. I shall not live to see the surrender of Quebec.\" At five the next morning he died happy. Prideaux moved up Lake Ontario, and on the 6th of July invested Niagara. Its capture would cut off the French from the west, and every en deavor was made to hold it. Troops, destined to take the small garrison at Fort Pitt, were held to assist in raising the siege of Niagara. M. de Aubry, commandant in Illinois, came up with 400 men and 200,000 pounds of flour. Cut off by the abandonment of Fort Du Quesne from the Ohio route, he ascended that river as far as the Wabash, thence to portage of Fort Miami, or Fort Wayne, reached Raystown, whither Washington had been ordered with his troops. Sickness had prevented him from being here already. Two officers were sent out to reconnoiter the fort, who returned and gave a very good account of its condition. Gen. Forbes desired to know more of it, and sent out Maj. Grant, with 800 men, to gain more complete knowledge. Maj. Grant, supposing not more than 200 soldiers to be in the fort, marched near it and made a feint to draw them out, and engage them in battle. He was greatly misinformed as to the strength of the French, and in the engagement that followed he was badly beaten \u2014 270 of his men killed, 42 wounded, and several, including himself, taken prisoners. The French, elated with their victory, attacked the main army, but were repulsed and obliged to retreat to the fort. The army con tinued on its march. On the 24th of November they reached Turtle Creek, where a council of war was held, and where Gen. Forbes, who had been so ill as to be carried on a litter from the start, de clared, with a mighty oath, he would sleep that night in the fort, or in a worse place. The Indi ans had, however, carried the news to the French that the English were as plenty as the trees of the woods, and in their fright they set fire to the fort in the night and left up and down the Ohio River. The next morning the English, who had heard the explosion of the magazine, and seen the light of the burning walls, marched in and took peaceable possession. A small fortification was thrown up on the bank, and, in honor of the great English statesman, it was called Fort Pitt. Col. Hugh Mer cer was left in command, and the main body of the army marched back to the settlements. It reached Philadelphia January 17, 1759. On the 11th of March, Gen. Forbes died, and was buried in the chancel of Christ's Church, in that city. Post was now sent on a mission to the Six Na tions, with a report of the treaty of Easton. He was again instrumental in preventing a coalition of the Indians and the French. Indeed, to this ob scure Moravian missionary belongs, in a large measure, the honor of the capture of Fort Du Quesne, for by his influence had the Indians been restrained from attacking the army on its march. The garrison, on leaving the fort, went up and down the Ohio, part to Presque Isle by land, part to Fort Venango, while some of them went on down the Ohio nearly to the Mississippi, and there, in what is now Massac County, 111., erected a fort, called by them Fort Massac. It was afterward named by many Fort Massacre, from the erroneous"], [57, "HISTORY OF OHIO. \u25a0i: down the Maumee to Lake Erie, and on to Presqu ville, or Presque Isle, over the portage to Le Roeuf, and thence down French Creek to Fort Venango. He was chosen to lead the expedition for the relies of Niagara. They were pursued by Sir William Johnson, successor to Prideaux, who had lost his life by the bursting of a cannon, and were obliged to flee. The next day Niagara, cut off from succor, surrendered. All America rang with exultation. Towns were bright with illuminations ; the hillsides shone with bonfires. From press, from pulpit, from platform, and from speakers' desks, went up one glad song of rejoicing. England was victorious everywhere. The colonies had done their full share, and now learned their strength. That strength was needed now, for ere long a different conflict raged on the soil of America \u2014 a conflict ending in the birth of a new nation. The English sent Gen. Stanwix to fortify Fort Pitt, still looked upon as one of the principal for tresses in the West. He erected a good fortifica tion there, which remained under Rritish control fifteen years. Now nothing of the fort is left. No memorial of the Rritish possession remains in the West but a single redoubt, built in 1764 by Col. Rouquet, outside of the fort. Even this can hardly now be said to exist. The fall of Quebec did not immediately produce the submission of Canada. M. de Levi, on whom the command devolved, retired with the French Army to Montreal. In the spring of 1760, he be sieged Quebec, but the arrival of an English fleet caused him to again retreat to Montreal. Amherst and Johnson, meanwhile, effected a union of their forces, the magnitude of whose armies convinced the French that resistance would be useless, and on the 8th of September, 51. de Vaudreuil, the Governor of Canada, surrendered Montreal, Quebec, Detroit, Mackinaw and all other posts in Canada, to the English commander-in chief, Amherst, on condition that the French in habitants should, during the war, be \"protected in the full and free exercise of their religion, and the full enjoyment of their civil rights, leaving their future destinies to be decided by the treaty of peace.\" Though peace was concluded in the New World, on the continent the Powers experienced some difficulty in arriving at a satisfactory settlement. It was finally settled by what is known in history as the \"family compact.\" France and Spain saw in the conquest the growing power of England, and saw, also, that its continuance only extended that power. Negotiations were re-opened, and on the 3d of November, 1762, preliminaries were agreed to and signed, and afterward ratified in Paris, in February, 1763. Ry the terms of the compact, Spain ceded to Great Britian East and West Florida. To compensate Spain, France ceded to her by a secret article, all Louisiana west of the Mississippi. The French and Indian war was now over. Canada and all its dependencies were now in pos session of the English, who held undisputed sway over the entire West as far as Mississippi. It only remained for them to take possession of the out posts. Major Robert Rogers was sent to take pos session of Detroit and establish a garrison there. He was a partisan officer on the borders of New Hampshire, where he earned a name for bravery, but afterward tarnished it by treasonable acts. On his way to Detroit, on the 7th of November, 1760, he was met by the renowned chief. Pontiac, who authoritatively commanded him to pause and ex plain his acts. Rogers replied by explaining the conquest of Canada, and that he was acting under orders from his Kina;. Through the influence of Pontiac, the army was saved from the Indians sent out by the French, and was allowed to pro ceed on its way. Pontiac had assured his protec tion as long as the English treated him with due deference. Reletre, the commandant at Detroit, refused to surrender to the English commander, until he had received positive assurance from his Governor, Vaudreuil, that the- country was indeed conquered. On the 29th of September, the colors of France gave way to the ensign of Great Rritain amid the shouts of the soldiery and the astonish ment of the Indians, whose savage natures could not understand how such a simple act declared one nation victors of another, and who wondered at the forbearance displayed. The lateness of the season prevented further operations, but early the next spring, Mackinaw. Green Ray, Ste. Marie, St. Joseph and the Ouitenon surrounded, and nothing was left but the 'Illinois towns. These were se cured as soon as the necessary arrangements could be made. Though the English were now masters of the West, and had, while many of these events nar rated were transpiring, extended their settlements beyond the Alleghanies, they were by no means secure in their possession. The woods and prairies were full of Indians, who, finding the English like the French, caring more for gain than the welfare"], [58, "48 HISTORY OF OHIO. traders incited the Indian to resent the encroach ment. \"The English will annihilate you and take all your land,\" said they. \" Their father, the King of France, had been asleep, now he had awakened and was coming with a great army to reclaim Can ada, that had been stolen from him while he slept.\" Discontent under such circumstances was but natural. Soon all the tribes, from the mountains to the Mississippi, were united in a plot. It was discovered in 1761, and arrested. The next sum mer, another was detected and arrested. The officers, and all the people, failed to realize the danger. The rattlesnake, though not found, was ready to strike. It is only an Indian discontent, thought the people, and they went on preparing to occupy the country. They were mistaken \u2014 the crisis only needed a leader to direct it. That leader appeared. of the natives, began to exhibit impatience and re sentment as they saw their lands gradually taken from them. The English policy differed very materially from the French. The French made the Indian, in a measure, independent and taught him a desire for European goods. They also affiliated easily with them, and became thereby strongly endeared to the savage. The French were a merry, easy-going race, fond of gayety and delighting in adventure. The English were harsh, stern, and made no advances to gain the friend ship of the savage. They wanted land to cultivate and drove away the Indian's game, and forced him farther west. \"Where shall we go?\" said the Indian, despondently; \"you drive us farther and farther west; by and by you will want all the land.\" And the Anglo-Saxon went sturdily on, paying no heed to the complaints. The French CHAPTER IV. FAILURE\u2014 BOUQUET' S EXPEDITION\u2014 OCCUPATION BY THE PONTIAC'S CONSPIRACY\u2014 ITS ENGLISH, PONTIAC, the great chief of the Ottawas, was now about fifty years old. He had watched the conflict between the nations with a jealous eye, and as he saw the gradual growth of the English people, their encroachment on the lands of the In dians, their greed, and their assumption of the soil, his soul was stirred within him to do something for his people. He had been a true friend of the French, and had led the Indians at the defeat of Rraddock. Amid all the tumult, he alone saw the true state of affairs. The English would inevit ably crush out the Indians. To save his race he saw another alliance with the French was neces sary, and a restoration of their power and habits needed. It was the plan of a statesman. It only failed because of the perfidy of the French. Matur ing his plans late in the autumn of 1762, he sent messengers to all the Western and Southern tribes, with the black wampum and red tomahawk, em blems of war, from the great Pontiac. \"On a cer tain day in the next year,\" said the messenger, \"all the tribes are to rise, seize all the English posts, and then attack the whole frontier.\" The great council of all the tribes was held at the river Ecorces, on the 27th of April, 1763. There, before the assembled chiefs, Pontiac deliv- ered a speech, full of eloquence and art. He recounted the injuries and encroachments of the English, and disclosed their designs. The French king was now awake and would aid them. Should they resign their homes and the graves of their fathers without an effort? Were their young men no longer brave? Were they squaws? The Great Master of Life had chided them for their inactivity, and had sent his commands to drive the \"Red Dogs\" from the earth. The chiefs eagerly accepted the wampum and the tomahawk, and separated to prepare for the coming strife. The post at Detroit was informed of the plot the evening before it was to occur, by an Ojibway girl of great beauty, the mistress of the com mander, Major Gladwin. Pontiac was foiled here, his treachery discovered, and he was sternly ordered from the conference. A regular seige followed, but he could not prevail. He exhibited a degree of sagacity unknown in the annals of savage war fare, but all to no purpose ; the English were too strong for him. At all the other posts, save one, however, the plans of Pontiac were carried out, and atrocities, unheard of before in American history, resulted. The Indians attacked Detroit on the first of May,"], [59, "49 HISTORY OF OHIO. and, foiled in their plans, a siege immediately fol lowed. On the 16th, a party of Indians appeared before the fort at Sandusky. Seven of them were admitted. Suddenly, while smoking, the massacre begins. All but Ensign Paulli, the commander, fall. He is carried as a trophy to Pontiac. At the mouth of the St. Joseph's, the mission aries had maintained a mission station over sixty years. They gave way to an English garrison of fourteen soldiers and a few traders. On the morning of May 25, a deputation of Pottawato mies are allowed to enter. In less than two min utes, all the garrison but the commander are slain. He is sent to Pontiac. Near the present city of Fort Wayne, Ind., at the junction of the waters, stood Fort Miami, garrisoned by a few men. Holmes, the com mander, is asked to visit a sick woman. He is slain on the way, the sergeant following is made prisoner, and the nine soldiers surrender. On the night of the last day of May, the wam pum reaches the Indian village below La Fayette, Ind., and near Fort Ouitenon. The commander of the fort is lured into a cabin, bound, and his garrison surrender. Through the clemency of French settlers, they are received into their houses and protected. At Michilimackinac, a game of ball is projected. Suddenly the ball is thrown through the gate of the stockade. The Indians press in, and, at a signal, almost all are slain or made prisoners. The fort at Presque 'Isle, now Erie, was the point of communication between Pittsburgh and Niagara and Detroit. It was one of the most tenable, and had a garrison of four and twenty men. On the 22d of June, the commander, to save his forces from total annihilation, surrenders, and all are carried prisoners to Detroit. The capitulation at Erie lest Le E\u0153uf with out hope. He was attacked on the ISth, but kept off the Indians till midnight, when he made a successful retreat. As they passed Ve nango, on their way to Fort Pitt, they saw only the ruins of that garrison. Not one of its immates had been spared. Fort Pitt was the most important station west of the Alleghanies. \" Escape ! \" said Turtle's Heart, a Delaware warrior ; \" you will all be slain. A great army is coming.\" \"There are three large English armies coming to my aid,\" said Ecuyer, the commander. \" I have enough provisions and ammunition to stand a siege of three years' time.\" A second and third attempt was made by the savages to capture the post, but all to no avail. Raffled on all sides here, they destroy Ligonier, a few miles below, and massacre men, women and children. Fort Pitt was besieged till the last day of July, but withstood all attacks. Of all the outposts, only it and Detroit were left. All had been captured, and the majority of the garrison slain. Along the frontier, the war was waged with fury. The Indians were fighting for their homes and their hunting-grounds; and for these they fought with the fury and zeal of fanatics. \u2022 Detachments sent to aid Detroit are cut off. The prisoners are burnt, and Pontiac, infusing his zealous and demoniacal spirit into all his savage allies, pressed the siege with vigor. The French remained neutral, yet Pontiac made requisitions on them and on their neighbors in Illinois, issuing bills of credit on birch-bark, all of which were faithfully redeemed. Though these two posts could not be captured, the frontier could be annihilated, and vigorously the Indians pursued their policy. Along the borders of Pennsylvania and Virginia a relentless warfare was waged, sparing no one in its way. Old age, feeble infancy, strong man and gentle woman, fair girl and hope ful boy \u2014 all fell before the scalping-knife of the merciless savage. The frontiers were devastated. Thousands were obliged to flee, leaving their possessions to the torch of the Indian. The colonial government, under Rritish direc tion, was inimical to the borders, and the colonists saw they must depend only upon their own arms for protection. Already the struggle for freedom was upon them. They could defend only them selves. They must do it, too; for that defense is now needed in a different cause than settling dis putes between rival powers. \" We have millions for defense, but not a cent for tribute,\" said they, and time verified the remark. Gen. Amherst bestirred himself to aid the frontiers. He sent Col. Henry Rouquet, a native of Switzerland, and now an officer in the English Army, to relieve the garrison at Fort Pitt. They followed the route made by Gen. Forbes, and on the way relieved Forts Bedford and Ligonier, both beleaguered by the Indians. About a day's jour ney beyond Ligonier, he was attacked by a body of Indians at a place called Bushy Run. For awhile, it seemed that he and all his army would be destroyed ; but Rouquet was bold and brave and, under a feint of retreat, routed the savages. He passed on, and relieved the garrison at Fort"], [60, "50 HISTORY OF OHIO. Pitt, and thus secured it against the assaults of the Indians. The campaign had been disastrous to the En glish, but fatal to the plans of Pontiac. He could not capture Detroit, and he knew the great scheme must fail. The battle of Rushy Run and the relief of Fort Pitt closed the campaign, and all hope of co-operation was at an end. Circum stances were combined against the confederacy, and it was fast falling to pieces. A proclamation was issued to the Indians, explaining to them the existing state of affairs, and showing to them tlje futility of their plans. Pontiac, however, would not give up. Again he renewed the siege of De troit, and Gen. Gage, now in command of the army in the colonies, resolved to carry the war into their own country. Col. Rradstreet was or dered to lead one army by way of the lakes, against the Northern Indians, while Col. Rouquet was sent against the Indians of the Ohio. Col. Rradstreet went on his way at the head of 1,200 men, but trusting too much to the natives and their promises, his expedition proved largely a fail ure. He relieved Detroit in August, 1764, which had been confined in the garrison over fifteen months, and dispersed the Indians that yet lay around the fort. Rut on his way back, he saw how the Indians had duj)ed him, and that they were still plundering the settlements. His treaties were annulled by Gage, who ordered him to destroy their towns. The season was far advanced, his provisions were getting low, and he was obliged to return to Niagara chagrined and disappointed. Col. Rouquet knew well the character of the Indians, and shaped his plans accordingly. He had an army of 1,500 men, 500 regulars and 1,000 volunteers. They had had experience in fighting the savages, and could be depended on. At Fort Loudon, he heard of Rradstreet's ill luck, and saw through the deception practiced by the Indians. He arrived at Fort Pitt the 17th of September, where he arrested a deputation of chiefs, who met him with the same promises that had deceived Rradstreet. He sent one of their number back, threatening to put to death the chiefs unless they allowed his messengers to safely pass through their country to Detroit. The decisive tone of his words convinced them of the fate that awaited them unless they complied. On the 3d of Octo ber the army left Fort Pitt, marched down the river to and across the Tuscarawas, arriving in the vicinity of Fredrick Post's late mission on the 17th. There a conference was held with the assembled tribes. Bouquet sternly rebuked them for their faithlessness, and when told by the chiefs they could not restrain their young men, he as sternly told them they were responsible for their acts. He told them he would trust them no longer. If they delivered up all their prisoners within twelve days they might hope for peace, otherwise there would be no mercy shown them. They were completely humbled, aud, separating hastily, gathered their captives. On the 25th, the army proceeded down to the Tuscarawas, to the junction with White Woman River, near the town of Coshocton, in Coshocton County, Ohio, and there made prepa rations for the reception of the captives. There they remained until the 18th of November; from day to day prisoners were brought in \u2014 men, women and children \u2014 and delivered to their friends. Many were the touching scenes enacted during this time. The separated husband and wife met, the latter often carrying a child born in captivity. Brothers and sisters, separated in youth, met ; lovers rushed into each other's arms ; children found their parents, mothers their sons, fathers their daughters, and neighbors those from whom they had been separated many years. Yet, there were many dis tressing scenes. Some looked in vain for long-lost relatives and friends, that never should return. Others, that had been captured in their infancy, would not leave their savage friends, and when force was used some fled away. One mother looked in vain for a child* she had lost years be fore. Day by day, she anxiously watched, but no daughter's voice reached her ears. One, clad in savage attire, was brought before her. It could not be her daughter, she was grown. So was the maiden before her. \" Can not you remember some mark?\" asked Bouquet, whose sympathies were aroused in this case. \"There is none,\" said the anxious and sorrowful mother. \" Sing a song you sang over her cradle, she may remember,\" suggested the commander. One is sung by her mother. As the song of childhood floats out among the trees the maiden stops and listens, then approaches. Yes, she remembers. Mother and daughter are held in a close embrace, and the stern Bouquet wipes away a tear at the scene. On the 18th, the army broke up its encamp ment and started on its homeward march. Bouquet kept six principal Indians as hostages, and re turned to the homes of the captives. The Indians kept their promises faithfully, and the next year representatives of all the Western tribes met Sir William Johnson, at the German Flats, and made"], [61, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 51 a treaty of peace. A tract of land in the Indian country was ceded to the whites for the benefit of those who had suffered in the late war. The In dians desired to make a treaty with Johnson, whereby the Alleghany River should be the west ern boundary of the English, but he excused him self on the ground of proper power. Not long after this the Illinois settlements, too remote to know much of the struggle or of any of the great events that had convulsed an empire, and changed the destiny of a nation, were brought under the English rule. There were five villages at this date : Kaskaskia, Cahokia, St. Philip, Vin cennes and Prairie du Rocher, near Fort Chartres, the military headquarters of these French posses sions. They were under the control or command of M. de Abadie, at New Orleans. They had also extended explorations west of the Mississippi, and made a few settlements in what was Spanish terri tory. The country had been, however, ceded to France, and in February, 1764, the country was formally taken possession of and the present city of St. Louis laid out. The English now owned the Northwest. True, they did not yet occupy but a small part of it, but traders were again crossing the mountains, ex plorers for lands were on the Ohio, and families for settlement were beginning to look upon the West as their future home. Companies were again forming to purchase large tracts in the Ohio coun try, and open them for emigration. One thing yet stood in the way \u2014 a definite boundary line. That line, however, was between the English and the Indians, and not, as had heretofore been the case, between rival European Powers. It was necessary to arrange some definite boundary before land com panies, who were now actively pushing their claims, could safely survey and locate their lands. Sir William Johnson, who had at previous times been instrumental in securing treaties, wrote re peatedly to the Board of Trade, who controlled the greater part of the commercial transactions in the colonies \u2014 -and who were the first to exclaim against extending English settlements beyond a limit whereby they would need manufactures, and there by become independent of the Mother Country \u2014 urging upon them, and through them the Crown, the necessity of a fixed boundary, else another Indian war was probable. The Indians found themselves gradually hemmed in by the growing power of the whites, and began to exhibit hostile feelings. The irritation became so great that in the summer of 1767, Gage wrote to the Governor of Pennsylvania concerning it. The Governor communicated his letter to the General Assembly, who sent repre sentatives to England, to urge the immediate set tlement of the question. In compliance with these requests, and the letters of prominent citizens, Franklin among the number, instructions were sent to Johnson, ordering him to complete the purchase from the Six Nations, and settle all differences. He sent word to all the Western tribes to meet him at Fort Stanwix, in October, 1768. The con ference was held on the 24th of that month, and was attended by colonial representatives, and by Indians from all parts of the Northwest. It was determined that the line should begin on the Ohio, at the mouth of the Cherokee (Tennessee), thence up the river to the Alleghany and on to Kittan ning, and thence across to the Susquehanna. By this line, the whole country south of the Ohio and Alleghany, to which the Six Nations had any claim, was transferred. Part of this land was made to compensate twenty-two traders, whose goods had been stolen in 1763. The deeds made, were upon the express agreement that no claims should As soon as the French knew of the change of government, many of them went to the west side of the river, and took up their residence there. They were protected in their religion and civil rights by the terms of the treaty, but preferred the rule of their own King. The British took possession of this country early in 1765. Gen. Gage sent Capt. Stirling, of the English Army, who arrived before summer, and to whom St. Ange, the nominal commandant, surren dered the authority. The British, through a suc cession of commanders, retained control of the coun try until defeated by George Rogers Clarke, and his \"ragged Virginia militia.\" Aster a short time, the French again ceded the country west of the Mississippi to Spain, and re linquished forever their control of all the West in the New World- The population of Western Louisiana, when the exchange of governments occurred, was estimated to be 13,538, of which 891 were in the Illinois country \u2014 as it was called \u2014 west of the Mississippi. East of the river, and before the French crossed into Spanish country, the population was estimated to be about 3,000. All these had grown into communities of a peculiar character. Indeed, that peculiarity, as has been observed, never changed until a gradual amalgamation with the American people effected it, and that took more than a cen tury of time to accomplish."], [62, "32 HISTORY OF OHIO. spite of troubles with the Indians \u2014 some of whom regarded the treaties with the Six Nations as un lawful, and were disposed to complain at the rapid influx of whites \u2014 and the failure of the land com panies, settlers came steadily during the decade from 1768 to 1778, so that by the close of that time, there was a large population south of the Ohio River ; while scattered along the northern banks, extending many miles into the wilderness, were hardy adventurers, who were carving out homes in the magnificent forests everywhere cov ering the country. Among the foremost speculators in Western lands, was George Washington. As early as 1763, he employed Col. Crawford, afterward the leader in \" Crawford's campaign,\" to purchase lands for him. In 1770, he crossed the mountains in company with several gentlemen, and examined the country along the Ohio, down which stream he passed to the mouth of the Great Kanawha, where he shot some buffalo, then plenty, camped out a few nights, and returned, fully convinced, it seems, that one day the West would be the best part of the New- World. He owned, altogether, nearly fifty thou sand acres in the West, which he valued at $3.33 per acre. Had not the war of the Revolution just then broken out, he might have been a resident of the West, and would have been, of course, one of its most prominent citizens. ever be based on the treaties of Lancaster, Logs town, etc., and were signed by the chiefs of the Six Nations for themselves, their allies and dependents, and the Shawanees, Delawares, Mingoes of Ohio, and others; though the Shawanees and Delaware deputies did not sign them. On this treaty, in a great measure, rests the title by purchase to Ken tucky, Western Virginia and Western Pennsylva nia. The rights of the Cherokees were purchased by Col. Donaldson, either for the King, Virginia, or for himself, it is impossible to say which. The grant of the northern confederacy was now made. The white man could go in and possess these lands, and know that an army would protect him if necessary. Under such a guarantee, West ern lands came rapidly into market. In addition to companies already in existence for the purchase of land, others, the most notable of these being the \"Walpole\" and the \"Mississippi\" Land Companies, were formed. This latter had among its organizers such men as Francis Lightfoot Lee, Richard Henry Lee, George Washington and Arthur Lee. Before any of these companies, some of whom ab sorbed the Ohio Company, could do anything, the Revolution came on, and all land transactions were at an end. After its close, Congress would not sanction their claims, and they fell through. This did not deter settlers, however, from crossing the mountains, and settling in the Ohio country. In CHAPTER V. AMERICAN EXPLORATIONS \u2014 DUNMORE'S WAR CAMPAIGN OF GEORGE ROGERS CLARKE- LAND TROUBLES\u2014 SPAIN IN THE REVOLUTION \u2014 MURDER OF THE MORAVIAN INDIANS. MEANWHILE, Kentucky was filling with citizens, and though considerable trouble was experienced with the Indians, and the operations of Col. Richard Henderson and others, who made unlawful treaties with the Indians, yet Daniel Boone and his associates had established a commonwealth, and, in 1777, a county was formed, which, erelong, was divided into three. Louisville was laid out on land belonging to Tories, and an important start made in this part of the West. Emigrants came down the Ohio River, saw the northern shores were inviting, and sent back such accounts that the land north of the river rapidly grew in favor with Eastern people. One of the most important Western characters, Col. (afterward Gen.) George Rogers Clarke, had had much to do in forming its character. He was born November 19, 1752, in Albemarle County, Va., and early came West. He had an unusually sagacious spirit, was an excellent sur veyor and general, and took an active interest in all State and national affairs. He understood the animus of the Revolution, and was prepared to do his part. Col. Clarke was now meditating a move unequaled in its boldness, and one that had more to do with the success of America in the struggle for independence than at first appears. He saw through the whole plan of the British,"], [63, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 53 who held all the outposts, Kaskaskia, Detroit, Vincennes and Niagara, and determined to circum vent them and wrest the West from their power. The British hoped to encircle the Americans by these outposts, and also unite the Indians in a common war against them. That had been attempted by the French when the English con quered them. Then the French had a powerful ally in the person of Pontiac, yet the brave front iersmen held their homes in many places, though the Indians \" drank the blood of many a Briton, scooping it up in the hollow of joined hands.\" Now the Briton had no Pontiac to lead the scat tered tribes \u2014 tribes who now feared the unerring aim of a settler, and would not attack him openly \u2014 Clarke knew that the Delawares were divided in feeling and that the Shawanees were but imperfectly united in favor of England since the murder of their noted chief's. He was convinced that, if the British could be driven from the Western posts, the natives could easily be awed into submission, or bribed into neutrality or friendship. They admired, from their savage views of valor, the side that became victorious. They cared little for the cause for which either side was fighting. Clarke sent out spies among them to ascertain the feasibility of his plans. The spies were gone from April 20 to June 22, and fully corroborated his views concerning the English policy and the fealings of the Indians and French. Before proceeding in the narrative of this expe dition, however, it will be well to notice a few acts transpiring north of the Ohio River, especially re lating to the land treaties, as they were not without effect on the British policy. Many of the Indians north and south of the Ohio would not recognize the validity of the Fort Stanwix treaty, claiming the Iroquois had no right to the lands, despite their conquest. These discontented natives har assed the emigrants in such a manner that many Indians were slain in retaliation. This, and the working of the \u25a0 French traders, who at all times were bitterly opposed to the English rule, filled the breasts of the natives with a malignant hate, which years of bloodshed could not wash out. The murder of several Indians by lawless whites fanned the coal into a blaze, and, by 1774, several retalia tory murders occurred, committed by the natives in revenge for their fallen friends. The Indian slew any white man he found, as a revenge on some friend of his slain ; the frontiersman, acting on the same principle, made the borders extremely dan gerous to invaders and invaded. Another cause of fear occurred about this time, which threatened seriously to retard emigration. Pittsburgh had been claimed by both Pennsyl vania and Virginia, and, in endeavoring to settle the dispute, Lord Dunmore's war followed. Dr. John Connelly, an ambitious, intriguing person, induced Lord Dunmore to assert the claims of Vir ginia, in the name of the King. In attempting to carry out his intentions, he was arrested by Arthur St. Clair, representing the proprietors of Pennsyl vania, who was at Pittsburgh at the time. Con nelly was released on bail, but went at once to Staunton, where he was sworn in as a Justice of Peace. Returning, he gathered a force of one hundred and fifty men, suddenly took possession of Pittsburgh, refused to allow the magistrates to enter the Court House, or to exercise the functions of their offices, unless in conformity to his will. Connelly refused any terms offered by the Penn sylvania deputies, kept possession of the place, acted very harshly toward the inhabitants, stirred up the neutral Indians, and, for a time, threatened to make the boundary line between the two colonies a very serious question. His actions led to hostile deeds by some Indians, when the whites, no doubt urged by him, murdered seven Indians at the mouth of the Captina River, and at the house of a settler named Baker, where the Indians were decoyed under promises of friendship and offers of rum. Among those murdered at the latter place, was the entire family of the famous Mingoe chief, Logan. This has been charged to Michael Cresap ; but is untrue. Daniel Greathouse had command of the party, and though Cresap may have been among them, it is unjust to lay the blame at his feet. Both murders, at Captina and Yellow Creek, were cruel and unwarranted, and were, without doubt, the cause of the war that followed, though the root of the matter lay in Connelly's arbitrary actions, and in his needlessly alarming the Indians. Whatever may have been the facts in relation to the murder of Logan's family, they were of such a nature as to make all feel sure of an Indian war, and preparations were made for the conflict. An army was gathered at Wheeling, which, some time in July, under command of Col. Mc- Donald, descended the Ohio to the mouth of Cap tina Creek. They proposed to march against an Indian town on the Muskingum. The Indians sued for peace, but their pretensions being found spurious, their towns and crops were destroyed. The army then retreated to Williamsburg, having accomplished but little."], [64, "54 HISTORY OF OHIO. The Delawares were anxious for peace ; even the Mingoes, whose relatives had been slain at Yellow Creek, and Captina, were restrained; but Logan, who had been turned to an inveterate foe to the Americans, came suddenly upon the Monongahela settlements, took thirteen scalps in revenge for the loss of his family, returned home and expressed himself ready to treat with the Long Knives, the Virginians. Had Connelly acted properly at this juncture, the war might have been ended; but his actions only incensed both borderers and In dians. So obnoxious did he become that Lord Dunmore lost faith in him, and severely repri manded him. To put a stop to the depredations of the Indians, two large bodies of troops were gathered in Vir ginia, one under Gen. Andrew Lewis, and one under command of Dunmore himself. Before the armies could meet at the mouth of the Great Kanawha, their objective point, Lewis' army, which arrived first, was attacked by a furious band of Dela wares, Shawanees, Iroquois and Wyandots. The conflict was bitterly prolonged by the Indians, who, under the leadership of Cornstalk, were deter mined to make a decisive effort, and fought till late at night (October 10, 1774), and then only by a strategic move of Lewis' command \u2014 which re sulted in the defeat of the Indians, compelling them to cross the Ohio \u2014 -was the conflict ended. Mean while, Dunmore's army came into the enemy's country, and, being joined by the remainder of Lewis' command, pressed forward intending to an nihilate the Indian towns. Cornstalk and his chiefs, however, sued for peace, and the conflict closed. Dunmore established a camp on Sippo Creek, where he held conferences with the natives and concluded the war. When he left the country, he stationed 100 men at the mouth of the Great Kanawha, a few more at Pittsburgh, and another corps at Wheeling, then called Fort Fincastle. Dunmore intended to return to Pittsburgh the next spring, meet the Indians and form a definite peace ; but the revolt of the colonies prevented. However, he opened several offices for the sale of lands in the West, some of which were in the limits of the Pennsylvania colony. This led to the old boundary dispute again; but before it could be settled, the Revolution began, and Lord Dunmore's, as well as almost all other land speculations in the West, were at an end. In 1775 and 1776, the chief events transpiring in the West relate to the treaties with the Indians, and the endeavor on the part of the Americans to have them remain neutral in the family quarrel now coming on, which they could not understand. The British, like the French, however, could not let them alone, and finally, as a retaliatory measure, Congress, under advice of Washington, won some of them over to the side of the colonies, getting their aid and holding them neutral. The colonies only offered them rewards for prisoners ; never, like the British, offering rewards for scalps. Under such rewards, the atrocities of the Indians in some quar ters were simply horrible. The scalp was enough to get a reward, that was a mark of Indian valor, too, and hence, helpless innocence and decrepit old age were not spared. They stirred the minds of the pioneers, who saw the protection of their fire sides a vital point, and led the way to the scheme of Col. Clarke, who was now, as has been noted, the leading spirit in Kentucky. He saw through the scheme of the British, and determined, by a quick, decisive blow, to put an end to it, and to cripple their power in the West. Among the acts stimulating Clarke, was the attack on Fort Henry, a garrison about one-half mile above Wheeling Creek, on the Ohio, by a renegade white man, Simon Girty, an agent in the employ of the British, it is thought, and one of the worst wretches ever known on the frontier. When Girty attacked Fort Henry, he led his red allies in regu lar military fashion, and attacked it without mercy. The defenders were brave, and knew with whom they were contending. Great bravery was displayed by the women in the fort, one of whom, a Miss Zane, carried a keg of gunpowder from a cabin to the fort. Though repeatedly fired at by the sav ages, she reached the fort in safety. After awhile, however, the effect of the frontiersmen's shots began to be felt, and the Indians sullenly withdrew. Re-enforcements coming, the fort was held, and Girty and his band were obliged to flee. Clarke saw that if the British once got con trol over the Western Indians the scene at Fort Henry would be repeated, and would not likely, in all cases, end in favor of the Americans. With out communicating any of his designs, he left Har rodsburg about the 1st of October, 1777, and reached the capital of Virginia by November 5. Still keeping his mind, he awaited a favorable op portunity to broach his plans to those in power, and, in the meanwhile, carefully watched the exist ing state of feeling. When the opportunity came, Clarke broached his plans to Patrick Henry, Gov ernor of Virginia, who at once entered warmly into them, recognizing their great importance."], [65, "5,, 55 HISTORY OF OHIO. Through his aid, Clarke procured the necessary au thority to prosecute his plans, and returned at once to Pittsburgh. He intended raising men about this post, but found them fearful of leaving their homes unprotected. However, he secured three companies, and, with these and a number of volun teers, picked up on the way down the Ohio River, he fortified Corn Island, near the falls, and made ready for his expedition. He had some trouble in keeping his men, some of those from Kentucky refusing to aid in subduing stations out of their own country. He did not announce his real inten tions till he had reached this point. Here Col. Bowman joined him with his Kentucky militia, and, on the 24th of June, 1778, during a total eclipse of the sun, the party left the fort. Before his start, he learned of the capture of Burgoyne, and, when nearty down to Fort Massac, ho met some of his spies, who informed him of the exag gerated accounts of the ferocity of the Long Knives that the French had received from the British. By proper action on his part, Clarke saw both these items of information could be made very beneficial to him. Leaving the river near Fort Massac, he set out on the march to Kaskas kia, through a hot summer's sun, over a country full of savage foes. They reached the town un noticed, on the evening of July 4, and, before the astonished British and French knew it, they were all prisoners. M. Rocheblave, the English commander, was secured, but his wife adroitly con cealed the papers belonging to the garrison. In the person of M. Gibault, the French priest, Clarke found a true friend. When the true character of the Virginians became apparent, the French were easily drawn to the American side, and the priest secured the surrender and allegiance of Cahokia through his personal influence. M. Gibault told him he would also secure the post at St. Vincent's, which he did, returning from the mission about the 1st of August. During the interval, Clarke re enlisted his men, formed his plans, sent his pris oners to Kentucky, and was ready for future action when M. Gibault arrived. He sent Capt. Helm and a single soldier to Vincennes to hold that fort until he could put a garrison there. It is but proper to state that the English commander, Col. Hamilton, and his band of soldiers, were absent at Detroit when the priest secured the village on the \" Ouabache.\" When Hamilton returned, in the autumn, he was greatly surprised to see the Amer ican flag floating from the ramparts of the fort, and when approaching the gate he was abruptly halted by Capt. Helm, who stood with a lighted fuse in his hand by a cannon, answering Hamilton's demand to surrender with the imperative inquiry, \"Upon what terms, sir?\" \"Upon the honors of war,\" answered Hamilton, and he marched in greatly chagrined to see he had been halted by two men. The British commander sat quietly down, intending to go on down the river and sub due Kentucky in the spring, in the mean time offering rewards for American scalps, and thereby gaining the epithet \" Hair-buy er General. ' ' Clarke heard of his actions late in January, 1779, and, as he says, \" I knew if I did not take him he would take me,\" set out early in February with his troops and marched across the marshy plains of Lower Illinois, reaching the Wabash post by the 22d of that month. The unerring aim of the Westerner was effectual. \" They will shoot your eyes out,\" said Helm to the British troops. \" There, I told you so,\" he further exclaimed, as a soldier vent ured near a port-hole and received a shot directly in his eye. On the 24th the fort surrendered. The American flag waved again over its ramparts. The \" Hair-buyer General\" was sent a prisoner to Virginia, where he was kept in close confinement for his cruel acts. Clarke returned to Kaskaskia, perfected his plans to hold the Illinois settlements, went on to Kentucky, from where he sent word to the colonial authorities of the success of his expe dition. Had he received the aid promised him, Detroit, in easy reach, would have fallen too, but Gen. Green, failing to send it as promised, the capt ure of that important post was delayed. Had Clarke failed, and Hamilton succeeded, the whole West would have been swept, from the Alle ghanies to the Mississippi. But for this small army of fearless Virginians, the union of all the tribes from Georgia to Maine against the colonies might have been effected, and the whole current of American history changed. America owes Clarke and his band more than it can ever pay. Clarke reported the capture of Kaskaskia and the Illinois country early after its surrender, and in October the county of Illinois was established, extending over an unlimited expanse of country, by the Virginia Legislature. John Todd was appointed Lieutenant Colonel and Civil Governor. In November, Clarke and his men received the thanks of the same body, who, in after years, secured them a grant of land, which they selected on the right bank of the Ohio River, opposite Louisville. They expected here a city would rise one day, to be the peer of Louisville, then coming"], [66, "56 HISTORY OF OHIO. into prominence as an important place. By some means, their expectations failed, and only the dilapidated village of Clarkesburg perpetuates their hopes. The conquest of Clarke changed the face of affairs in relation to the whole country north of the Ohio River, which would, in all probability, have been made the boundary between Canada and the United States. When this was proposed, the strenuous arguments based on this conquest, by the American Commissioners, secured the present boundary line in negotiating the treaty of 1793. Though Clarke had failed to capture Detroit, Congress saw the importance of the post, and resolved on securing it. Gen. McCosh, commander at Fort Pitt, was put in command, and $1,000, 000 and 3,000 men placed at his disposal. By some dilatory means, he got no further than the Tuscarawas River, in Ohio, where a half-way house, called Fort Laurens, for the President of Congress, was built. It was too far out to be of practicable value, and was soon after abandoned. Indian troubles and incursions by the British were the most absorbing themes in the West. The British went so far as Kentucky at a later date, while they intended reducing Fort Pitt, only abandoning it when learning of its strength. Expeditions against the Western Indians were led by Gen. Sullivan, Col. Daniel Broadhead, Col. Bowman and others, which, for awhile, silenced the natives and taught them the power of the Americans. They could not organize so readily as before, and began to attach themselves more closely to the British, or commit their depredations in bands, fleeing into the wilderness as soon as they struck a blow. In this way, several localities suffered, until the settlers became again exasper ated ; other expeditions were formed, and a second chastisement given. In 1781, Col. Broadhead led an expedition against the Central Ohio Indians. It did not prove so successful, as the Indians were led by the noted chief Brant, who, though not cruel, was a foe to the Americans, and assisted the British greatly in their endeavors to secure the West. Another class of events occurred now in the West, civil in their relations, yet destined to form an important part of its history\u2014 its land laws. It must be borne in mind, that Virginia claimed the greater portion of the country north of the Ohio River, as well as a large part south. The other colonies claimed land also in the West under the old Crown grants, which extended to the South or Western Sea. To more complicate mat- ters, several land companies held proprietary rights to portions of these lands gained by grants from the Crown, or from the Colonial Assemblies. Others were based on land warrants issued in 1763; others on selection and survey and still others on settlement. In this state of mixed affairs, it was difficult to say who held a secure claim. It was a question whether the old French grants were good or not, especially since the change in government, and the eminent pros pect of still another change. To, in some way, aid in settling these claims, Virginia sent a com mission to the West to sit as a court and determine the proprietorship of these claims. This court, though of as doubtful authority as the claims themselves, went to work in Kentucky and along the Ohio River in 1779, and, in the course of one year, granted over three thousand certificates. These were considered as good authority for a definite title, and were so regarded in after pur chases. Under them, many pioneers, like Daniel Boone, lost their lands, as all were required to hold some kind of a patent, while others, who possessed no more principle than \"land-sharks\" of to-day, acquired large tracts of land by holding a patent the court was bound to accept. Of all the colonies, Virginia seemed to have the best title to the Northwest, save a few parcels, such as the Connecticut or Western Reserve and some similar tracts held by New York, Massachusetts and New Jersey. When the territory of the Northwest was ceded to the General Government, this was recognized, and that country was counted as a Virginia county. The Spanish Government, holding the region west of the Mississippi, and a portion east toward its outlet, became an important but secret ally of the Americans. When the French revolt was suppressed by O'Reilly, and the Spanish assumed the government of Louisiana, both Upper and Lower, there was a large tract of country, known as Florida (East and West), claimed by England, and duly regarded as a part of her dominion. The boundaries had been settled when the French first occupied Lower Louisiana. The Spaniards adopted the patriarchal form of rule, as much as was consistent with their interests, and allowed the French full religious, and civil liberty, save that all tribunals were after the Spanish fashion, and governed by Spanish rules. The Spaniards, long jealous of England's growing power, secretly sent the Governors of Louisiana word to aid the Americans in their struggle for freedom. Though"], [67, "57 HISTORY OF OHIO. they controlled the Mississippi River, they allowed an American officer (Capt. Willing) to descend the river in January, 1778, with a party of fifty men, and ravage the Rritish shore from Manchez Rayou to Natchez. On the 8th of May, 1779, Spain declared war against Great Rritain; and, on the 8th of July, the people of Louisiana were allowed to take a part in the war. Accordingly, Galvez collected a force of 1,400 men, and, on the 7th of September, took Fort Manchac. Ry the 21st of September, he had taken Baton Rouge and Natchez. Eight vessels were captured by the Spaniards on the Mississippi and on the lakes. In 1780 Mobile fell ; in March, 1781, Pensacola, the chief Rritish post in West Florida, succumbed after a long siege, and, on the 9th of May, all West Florida was surrendered to Spain. This war, or the war on the Atlantic Coast, did not immediately affect Upper Louisiana. Great Rritain, however, attempted to capture St. Louis. Though the commander was strongly suspected of being bribed by the English, yet the place stood the siege from the combined force of Indians and Canadians, and the assailants were dispersed. This was done during the summer of 1680, and in the autumn, a company of Spanish and French resi dents, under La Ralme, went on an expedition against Detroit. They marched as far north as the Rritish trading-post Ke-ki-ong-a, at the head of the Maumee River, but being surprised in the night, and the commander slain, the expedition was defeated, having done but little. Spain may have had personal interests in aiding the Americans. She was now in control of the Mis sissippi River, the natural outlet of the Northwest, and, in 1780, began the troubles relative to the navigation of that stream. The claims of Spain were considered very unjust by the Continental Congress, and, while deliberating over the question, Virginia, who was jealously alive to her Western interests, and who yet held jurisdiction over Ken tucky, sent through Jefferson, the Governor, Gen. George Rogers Clarke, to erect a fort below the mouth of the Ohio. This proceeding was rather unwarrantable, especially as the fort was built in the country of the Chickasaws, who had thus far been true friends to the Americans, and who looked upon the fort as an innovation on their territory. It was completed and occupied but a short time, Clarke being recalled. Virginia, in 1780, did a very important thing; namely, establishing an institution for higher edu- cation. The Old Dominion confiscated the lands of \"Robert McKenzie, Henry Collins and Alex ander McKee, Rritons, eight thousand acres,\" and invested the proceeds of the sale in a public semi nary. Transylvania University now lives, a monu ment to that spirit. While Clarke was building Fort Jefferson, a force of Rritish and Indians, under command of Capt. Rryd, came down from Canada and attacked the Kentucky settlements, getting into the country be fore any one was aware. The winter before had been one of unusual severity, and game was ex ceedingly scarce, hence the army was not prepared to conduct a campaign. After the capture of Rud dle's Station, at the south fork of the Licking, Rryd abandoned any further attempts to reduce the set tlements, except capturing Martin's Station, and returned to Detroit. This expedition gave an additional motive for the chastisement of the Indians, and Clarke, on his return from Fort Jefferson, went on an expedition against the Miami Indians. He destroyed their towns at Loramie's store, near the present city of Sydney, Ohio, and at Piqua, humbling the natives. While on the way, a part of the army remained on the north bank of the Ohio, and erected two block-houses on the present site of Cincinnati. The exploits of Clarke and his men so effectually chastised the Indians, that, for a time, the West was safe. During this period of quiet, the meas ures which led to the cession of Western lands to the General Government, began to assume a defi nite form. All the colonies claiming Western lands were willing to cede them to the Government, save Virginia, which colony wanted a large scope of Southern country southeast of the Ohio, as far as South Carolina. All recognized the justice of all Western lands becoming public property, and thereby aiding in extinguishing the debts caused by the war of the Revolution, now about to close. As Virginia held a somewhat different view, the cession was not made until 1783. The subject, however, could not be allowed to rest. The war of the Revolution was now drawing to a close ; victory on the part of the colonies was apparent, and the Western lands must be a part of the public domain. Subsequent events brought about the desired cession, though several events transpired before the plan of cession was consum mated. Refore the close of 1780, the Legislature of Virginia passed an act, establishing the \" town of Louisville,\" and confiscated the lands of John"], [68, "58 HISTORY OF OHIO. tioned. Other hamlets grew around them, until in the interior of the colony, existed an Indian community, free from all savage vices, and grow ing up in Christian virtues. As their strength grew, lawless whites again began to oppress them. They could not understand the war of 1754, and were, indeed, in a truly embarrassing position. The savages could form no conception of any cause for neutrality, save a secret sympathy with the English ; and if they could not take up the hatchet, they were in the way, and must be removed. Fail ing to do this, their red brothers became hostile. The whites were but little better. The old suspi cions which drove them from New York were aroused. They were secret Papists, in league with the French, and furnished them with arms and in telligence; they were interfering with the liquor traffic; they were enemies to the Government, and the Indian and the white man combined against them. They were obliged to move from place to place; were at one time protected nearly a year, near Philadelphia, from lawless whites, and finally were compelled to go far enough West to be out of the way of French and English arms, or the Iroquois and Cherokee hatchets. They came finally to the Muskingum, where they made a set tlement called Schonbrun, \"beautiful clear spring,\" in what is now Tuscarawas County. Other settle ments gathered, from time to time, as the years went on, till in 1772 large numbers of them were within the borders of the State. Until the war of independence broke out, they were allowed to peacefully pursue their way. When that came, they were between Fort Pitt and De troit, one of which contained Rritish, the other Americans. Again they could not understand the struggle, and could not take up the hatchet. This brought on them the enmity of both belligerent parties, and that of their own forest companions, who could not see wherein their natures could change. Among the most hostile persons, were the white renegades McKee, Girty and Elliott. On their instigation, several of them were slain, and by their advice they were obliged to leave their fields and homes, where they had many comforts, and where they had erected good chapels in which to worship. It was just before one of these forced removals that Mary, daughter of the missionary Heckewelder, was born. She is supposed to be the first white female child born north of the Ohio River. Her birth occurred April 16, 1781. It is but proper to say here, that it is an open ques tion, and one that will probably never be decided, Connelly, who was one of its original proprietors, and who distinguished himself in the commence ment of Lord Dunmore's war, and who was now a Tory, and doing all he could against the patriot cause. The proceeds of the sale of his lands were divided between Virginia and the county of Jefferson . Kentucky, the next year, was divided into three counties, Jefferson, Lincoln and Fayette. Courts were appointed in each, and the entry and location of lands given into their hands. Settlers, in spite of Indian troubles and Rritish intrigue, were pouring over the mountains, particularly so during the years 1780 and 1781. The . expeditions of Clarke against the Miami Indians ; Roone's cap tivity, and escape from them ; their defeat when attacking Roonesboro, and other places \u2014 all combined to weaken their power, and teach them to respect a nation whose progress they could not stay. The pioneers of the West, obliged to depend on themselves, owing to the struggle of the colonies for freedom, grew up a hardy, self-reliant race, with all the vices and virtues of a border life, and with habits, manners and customs necessary to their peculiar situation, and suited to their peculiar taste. A resume of their experiences and daily lives would be quite interesting, did the limits of this history admit it here. In the part relating directly to this county, the reader will find such lives given ; here, only the important events can be noticed. The last event of consequence occurring in the West before the close of the Revolution, is one that might well have been omitted. Had such been the case, a great stain would have been spared the character of Western pioneers. Reference is made to t.he massacre of the Moravian Christian Indians. These Indians were of the Delaware nation chiefly, though other Western tribes were visited and many converts made. The first converts were made in New York and Connecticut, where, after a good start had been made, and a prospect of many souls being saved, they incurred the enmity of the whites, who, becoming alarmed at their suc cess, persecuted them to such an extent that they were driven out of New York into Pennsylvania, where, in 1744, four years after their arrival in the New World, they began new missions. In 1748, the New York and Connecticut Indians fol lowed their teachers, and were among the founders of Friedenshutten, \"Tents of Peace,\" a hamlet near Rethlehem, where their teachers were sta-"], [69, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 59 /. e. Who was the first white child born in Ohio ? In all probability, the child was born during the captivity of its mother, as history plainly shows that when white women were released from the Indians, some of them carried children born while among the natives. When the Moravians were forced to leave their settlements on the Muskingum, and taken to San dusky, they left growing fields of corn, to which they were obliged to return, to gather food. This aroused the whites, only wanting some pretext whereby they might attack them, and a party, headed by Col. David Williamson, determined to exterminate them. The Moravians, hearing of their approach, fled, but too late to warn other settle ments, and Gnadenhutten, Salem and one or two smaller settlements, were surprised and taken. Under deceitful promises, the Indians gave up all their arms, showed the whites their treasures, and went unknowingly to a terrible death. When ap prised of their fate, determined on by a majority of the rangers, they begged only time to prepare. They were led two by two, the men into one, the women and children into another \"slaughter house,\" as it was termed, and all but two lads were wantonly slain. An infamous and more bloody deed never darkened the pages of feudal times ; a deed that, in after years, called aloud for venge ance, and in some measure received it. Some of Williamson's men wrung their hands at the cruel fate, and endeavored, by all the means in their power, to prevent it; but all to no purpose. The blood of the rangers was up, and they would not spare \"man, woman or child, of all that peaceful band.\" Having completed their horrible work, (March 8, 1782), Williamson and his men returned to Pittsburgh. Everywhere, the Indians lamented the untimely death of their kindred, their savage relatives determining on their revenge; the Chris tian ones could only be resigned and weep. Williamson's success, for such it was viewed by many, excited the borderers to another invasion, and a second army was raised, this time to go to the Sandusky town, and annihilate the Wyandots. Col. William Crawford was elected leader ; he accepted reluctantly ; on the way, the army was met by hordes of savages on the 5th of June, and totally routed. They were away north. in what is now Wyandot County, and were obliged to flee for their lives. The blood of the murdered Moravians called for revenge. The Indians de sired it ; were they not relatives of the fallen Christians ? Crawford and many of his men fell into their hands ; all suffered unheard-of tortures, that of Crawford being as cruel as Indian cruelty could devise. He was pounded, pierced, cut with knives and burned, all of which occupied nearly three hours, and finally lay down insensible on a bed of coals, and died. The savage captors, in demoni acal glee, danced around him, and upbraided him for the cruel murder of their relatives, giving him this only consolation, that had they captured Will iamson, he might go free, but he must answer for Williamson's brutality. The war did not cease here. The Indians, now aroused, carried their attack as far south as into Kentucky, killing Capt. Estill, a brave man, and some of his companions. The British, too, were active in aiding them, and the 14th of August a large force of them, under Girty, gathered silently about Bryant's Station. They were obliged to re treat. The Kentuekians pursued them, but were repulsed with considerable loss. The attack on Bryant's Station aroused the peo ple of Kentucky to strike a blow that would be felt. Gen. Clarke was put at the head of an army of one thousand and fifty men, and the Miami country was a second time destroyed. Clarke even went as far north as the British trading-post at the head of the Miami, where he captured a great amount of property, and destroyed the post. Other outposts also fell, the invading army suffering but little, and, by its decisive action, practically closing the Indian wars in the West, Pennsylvania suf fered some, losing Hannahstown and one or two small settlements. Williamson's and Crawford's campaigns aroused the fury of the Indians that took time and much blood and war to subdue. The Revolution was, however, drawing to a close. Amer ican arms were victorious, and a new nation was now coming into existence, who would change the whole current of Western matters, and make of the Northwest a land of liberty, equality and union. That nation was now on the stage."], [70, "HISTORY OF OHIO. Go CHAPTER VI.

Then it pursued another irregular western course to the Lake of the Woods, when it turned south ward to the Mississippi River. The commissioners insisted that should be the western boundary, as the lakes were the northern. It followed the Mis sissippi south until the mouth of Red River was reached, when, turning east, it followed almost a direct line to the Atlantic Coast, touching the coast a little north of the outlet of St. John's River. From this outline, it will be readily seen what boundary the United States possessed. Not one half of its present domain. At this date, there existed the original thirteen colonies : Virginia occupying all Kentucky and all the Northwest, save about half of Michigan and Wisconsin, claimed by Massachusetts; and the upper part of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, and the lower part (a narrow strip) of Michigan, claimed by Con necticut. Georgia included all of Alabama and Mississippi. The Spaniards claimed all Florida and a narrow part of lower Georgia. All the coun try west of the Father of Waters belonged to Spain, to whom it had been secretly ceded when the fam ily compact was made. That nation controlled the Mississippi, and gave no small uneasiness to the young government. It was, however, happily set tled finally, by the sale of Louisana to the United States. Pending the settlement of these questions and the formation of the Federal Union, the cession of the Northwest by Virginia again came before Congress. That body found itself unable to fulfill its promises to its soldiers regarding land, and again urged the Old Dominion to cede the Terri tory to the General Government, for the good of all. Congress forbade settlers from occupying the Western lands till a definite cession had been made, and the title to the lands in question made good. Rut speculation was stronger than law, and without waiting for the slow processes of courts, THE occupation ofthe West by the American, really dates from the campaign of Gen. Clarke in 1778, when he captured the British posts in the Illinois country, and Vincennes on the Wabash. Had he been properly supported, he would have reduced Detroit, then in easy reach, and poorly de fended. As it was, however, that post remained' in charge of the British till after the close of the war of the Revolution. They also held other lake posts; but these were included in the terms of peace, and came into the possession of the Ameri cans. They were abandoned by the British as soon as the different commanders received notice from their chiefs, and British rule and English occupation ceased in that part of the New World. The war virtually closed by the surrender of Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown, Va., October 19, 1781. The struggle was prolonged, however, by the British, in the vain hope that they could re trieve the disaster, but it was only a useless waste of men and money. America would not be sub dued. \"If we are to be taxed, we will be repre sented,\" said they, \"else we will be a free govern ment, and regulate our own taxes.\" In the end, they were free. Provisional articles of peace between the United States and Great Britain were signed in Paris on the 30th of November, 1782. This was followed by an armistice negotiated at Versailles on the 20th of January, 1783 ; and finally, a definite treaty of peace was concluded at Paris on the 3d of the next September, and ratified by Congress on the 4th of January, 1784. By the second article ofthe defi nite treaty of 1783, the boundaries of the United States were fixed. A glance at the map of that day shows the boundary to have been as follows: Beginning at Passamaquoddy Bay, on the coast of Maine, the line ran north a little above the forty fifth parallel of latitude, when it diverged southwest erly, irregularly, until it reached that parallel, when it followed it until it reached the St. Lawrence River. It followed that river to Lake Ontario, down its center; up the Niagara River ; through Lake Erie,"], [71, "ol 01 HISTORY OF OHIO. the adventurous settlers were pouring into the country at a rapid rate, only retarded by the rifle and scalping-knife of the savage \u2014 a temporary check. The policy of allowing any parties to obtain laud from the Indians was strongly discouraged by Washington. He advocated the idea that only the General Government could do that, and, in a letter to James Duane, in Congress, he strongly urged such a course, and pointed out the danger of a border war, unless some such measure was stringently followed. Under the circumstances, Congress pressed the claims of cession upon Virginia, and finally in duced the Dominion to modify the terms proposed two years before. On the 20th of December, 1783, Virginia accepted the proposal of Congress, and authorized her delegates to make a deed to the United States of all her right in the territory northwest of the Ohio. The Old Dominion stipulated in her deed of cession, that the territory should be divided into States, to be admitted into the Union as any other State, and to bear a proportionate share in the maintenance of that Union; that Virginia should be re-imbursed for the expense incurred in subduing the Rritish posts in the territory; that the French and Canadian inhabitants should be protected in their rights ; that the grant to Gen. George Rogers Clarke and his men, as well as all other similar grants, should be confirmed, and that the lands should be considered as the common property of the United States, the proceeds to be applied to the use of the whole country. Congress accepted these condi tions, and the deed was made March 1, 1784. Thus the country came from under the dominion of Virginia, and became common property. A serious difficulty arose about this time, that threatened for awhile to involve England and America anew in war. Virginia and several other States refused to abide by that part of the treaty relating to the payment of debts, especially so, when the Rritish carried away quite a number of negroes claimed by the Americans. This re fusal on the part of the Old Dominion and her abettors, caused the English to retain her North western outposts, Detroit, Mackinaw, etc. She held these till 1786, when the questions were finally settled,- and then readily abandoned them. The return of peace greatly augmented emigra tion to the West, especially to Kentucky. When the war closed, the population of that county ( the three counties having been made one judicial dis trict, and Danville designated as the seat of gov- ernment) was estimated to be about twelve thousand. In one year, after the close of the war, it increased to 30,00(), and steps for a State government were taken. Owing to the divided sentiment among its citizens, its perplexing questions of land titles and proprietary rights, nine conventions were held before a definite course of action could be reached. This prolonged the time till 1792, when, in De cember of that year, the election for persons to form a State constitution was held, and the vexed and complicated questions settled. In 1783, the first wagons bearing merchandise came across the mountains. Their contents were received on flat boats at Pittsburgh, and taken down the Ohio to Louisville, which that spring boasted of a store, opened by Daniel Broadhead. The next year, James Wilkinson opened one at Lexington. Pittsburgh was now the principal town in the West. It occupied the same position regarding the outposts that Omaha has done for several years to Nebraska. The town of Pittsburgh was laid out immediately after the war of 1764, by Col. Campbell. It then consisted of four squares about the fort, and received its name from that citadel. The treaty with the Six Nations in 1768, con veyed to the proprietaries of Pennsylvania all the lands of the Alleghany below Kittanning, and all the country south of the Ohio, within the limits of Penn's charter. This deed of cession was recog nized when the line between Pennsylvania and Virginia was fixed, and gave the post to the Key stone State. In accordance with this deed, the manor of Pittsburgh was withdrawn from market in 1769, and was held as the property of the Penn family. When Washington visited it in 1770, it seems to have declined in consequence of the afore-mentioned act. He mentions it as a \"town of about twenty log houses, on the Monongahela, about three hundred yards from the fort.\" The Penn's remained true to the King, and hence all their land that had not been surveyed and returned to the land office, was confiscated by the common wealth. Pittsburgh, having been surveyed, was still left to them. In the spring of 1784, Tench Francis, the agent of the Penns, was induced to lay out the manor into lots and offer them for sale. Though, for many years, the place was rather un promising, it eventually became the chief town in that part of the West, a position it yet holds. In 17S6, John Scull and Joseph Hall started the Pittsburgh Gazette, the first paper published west ofthe mountains. In the initial number, appeared a lengthy article from the pen of H. H. Brackenridge,"], [72, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 62 afterward one of the most prominent members of the Pennsylvania bar. He had located in Pittsburgh in 1781. His letter gives a most hope ful prospect in store for the future city, and is a highly descriptive article of the Western country. It is yet preserved in the \"Western Annals,\" and is well worth a perusal. Under the act of peace in 1783, no provision was made by the British for their allies, especially the Six Nations. The question was ignored by the English, and was made a handle by the Americans in gaining them to their cause before the war had fully closed. The treaties made were regarded by the Indians as alliances only, and when the En glish lest the country the Indians began to assume rather a hostile bearing. This excited the whites, and for a while a war with that formidable con federacy was imminent. Better councils prevailed, and Congress wisely adopted the policy of acquiring their lands by purchase. In accordance with this policy, a treaty was made at Fort Stanwix with the Six Nations, in October, 1784. By this treaty, all lands west of a line drawn from the mouth of Oswego Creek, about four miles east of Niagara, to the mouth of Buffalo Creek, and on to the northern boundary of Pennsylvania, thence west along that boundary to its western extremity, thence south to the Ohio River, should be ceded to the United States. ( They claimed west of this line by conquest. ) The Six Nations were to be secured in the lands they inhabited, reserving only six miles square around Oswego fort for the support of the same. By this treaty, the indefinite claim of the Six Nations to the West was extinguished, and the question of its ownership settled. It was now occupied by other Western tribes, who did not recognize the Iroquois claim, and who would not yield without a purchase. Especially was this the case with those Indians living in the northern part. To get possession of that country by the same process, the United States, through its commissioners, held a treaty at Fort Mclntosh on the 21st of January, 1785. The Wyandot, Delaware, Chippewa and Ottawa tribes were pres ent, and, through their chiefs, sold their lands to the Government. The Wyandot and Delaware nations were given a reservation in the north part of Ohio, where they were to be protected. The others were allotted reservations in Michigan. To all was given complete control of their lands, allow ing them to punish any white man attempting to settle thereon, and guaranteeing them in their rights. Ry such means Congress gained Indian titles to the vast realms north of the Ohio, and, a few months later, that legislation was commenced that should determine the mode of its disposal and the plan of its settlements. To facilitate the settlement of lands thus acquired, Congress, on May 20, 1785, passed an act for dispos ing of lands in the Northwest Territory. Its main provisions were : A surveyor or surveyors should be appointed from the States ; and a geographer, and his assistants to act with them. The surveyors were to divide the territory into townships of six miles square, by lines running due north and south, and east and west. The starting-place was to be on the Ohio River, at a point where the western boundary of Pennsylvania crossed it. This would give the first range, and the first township. As soon as seven townships were surveyed, the maps and plats of the same were to be sent to the Roard of the Treasury, who would record them and proceed to place the land in the market, and so on with all the townships as fast as they could be prepared ready for sale. Each town ship was to be divided into thirty-six sections, or lots. Out of these sections, numbers 8, 11, 26 and 29 were reserved for the use of the Government, and lot No. 16, for the establishment of a common school fund. One-third of all mines and minerals was also reserved for the United States. Three townships on Lake Erie were reserved for the use of officers, men and others, refugees from Canada and from Nova Scotia, who were entitled to grants of land. The Moravian Indians were also exempt from molestation, and guaranteed in their homes. Sol diers' claims, and all others of a like nature, were also recognized, and land reserved for them. Without waiting for the act of Congress, settlers had been pouring into the country, and, when or dered by Congress to leave undisturbed Indian lands, refused to do so. They went into the In dian country at their peril, however, and when driven out by the Indians could get no redress from the Government, even when life was lost. The Indians on the Wabash made a treaty at Fort Finney, on the Miami, January 31, 1786, promising allegiance to the United States, and were allowed a reservation. This treaty did not include the Piankeshaws, as was at first intended. These, refusing to live peaceably, stirred up the Shawa nees, who began a series of predatory excursions against the settlements. This led to an expedition against them and other restless tribes. Gen. Clarke commanded part of the army on that expedition,"], [73, ""], [74, ""], [75, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 65 but got no farther than Vincennes, when, owing to the discontent of his Kentucky troops, he was obliged to return. Col. Renjamin Logan, how ever, marched, at the head of four or five hundred mounted riflemen, into the Indian country, pene trating as for as the head-waters of Mad River. He destroyed several towns, much corn, and took about eighty prisoners. Among these, was the chief of the nation, who was wantonly slain, greatly to Logan's regret, who could not restrain his men. His expedition taught the Indians sub mission, and that they must adhere to their con tracts. Meanwhile, the difficulties of the navigation of the Mississippi arose. Spain would not relinquish the right to control the entire southern part of the river, allowing no free navigation. She was secretly hoping to cause a revolt of the Western provinces, especially Kentucky, and openly favored such a move. She also claimed, by conquest, much of the land on the east side of the river. The slow move ments of Congress; the failure of Virginia to properly protect Kentucky, and the inherent rest lessness in some of the Western men, well-nigh precipitated matters, and, for a while, serious results were imminent. The Kentuckians, and, indeed, all the people of the West, were determined the river should be free, and even went so far as to raise a regiment, and forcibly seize Spanish prop erty in the West. Great Rritain stood ready, too, to aid the West should it succeed, providing it would make an alliance with her. Rut while the excitement was at its height, Washington coun seled better ways and patience. The decisive tone of the new republic, though almost overwhelmed with a burden of debt, and with no credit, debarred the Spanish from too forcible measures to assert their claims, and held back the disloyal ones from attempting a revolt. New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut ceded their lands, and now the United States were ready to fulfill their promises of land grants, to the sol- diers who had preserved the nation. This did much to heal the breach in the West, and restore confidence there ; so that the Mississippi question was overlooked for a time, and Kentucky forgot her animosities. The cession of their claims was the signal for the formation of land companies in the East ; com- panies whose object was to settle the Western coun- try, and, at the same time, enrich the founders of the companies. Some of these companies had been formed in the old colonial days, but the recent war had put a stop to all their proceedings. Congress would not recognize their claims, and new com panies, under old names, were the result. Ry such means, the Ohio Company emerged from the past, and, in 1786, took an active existence. Renjamin Tupper, a Revolutionary soldier, and since then a government surveyor, who had been west as far as Pittsburgh, revived the question. He was prevented from prosecuting his surveys by hostile Indians, and returned to Massachusetts. He broached a plan to Gen. Rufus Putnam, as to the renewal of their memorial of 1783. which re sulted in the publication of a plan, and inviting all those interested, to meet in February in their re spective counties, and choose delegates to a con vention to be held at the \" Runch-of-grapes Tav ern.\" in Roston, on the first of March, 1786. On the day appointed, eleven persons appeared, and by the 3d of March an outline was drawn up, and subscriptions under it began at once. The leading features of the plan were : \"A fund of $1 ,000,000, mainly in Continental certificates, was to be raised for the purpose of purchasing lands in the Western country; there were to be 1,000 shares of $1,000 each, and upon each share $10 in specie were to be paid for contingent expenses. One year's inter est was to be appropriated to the charges of making a settlement, and assisting those unable to move without aid. The owners of every twenty shares were to choose an agent to represent them and attend to their interests, and the agents were to choose the directors. The plan was approved, and in a year's time from that date, the Company was organized.\"* Ry the time this Company was organized, all claims of the colonies in the coveted territory were done away with by their deeds of cession, Connect icut being the last. While troubles were still existing south of the Ohio River, regarding the navigation of the Mis sissippi, and many urged the formation of a sepa rate, independent State, and while Congress and Washington were doing what they could to allay the feeling north of the Ohio, the New England associates were busily engaged, now that a Com pany was formed, to obtain the land they wished to purchase. On the 8th of March, 1787, a meet ing of the agents chose Gen. Parsons, Gen. Put nam and the Rev. Mannasseh Cutler, Directors for the Company. The last selection was quite a fitting one for such an enterprise. Dr. Cutler was * Historical Collections."], [76, "HISTORY OF OHIO. GG boundary of the tenth township from the Ohio, direct to the Scioto, was sold to the Ohio associ ates and their secret copartners, for $1 per acre, subject to a deduction of one-third for bad lands and other contingencies. The whole tract was not, however, paid for nor taken by the Company \u2014 even their own portion of a million and a half acres, and extending west to the eighteenth range of townships, was not taken ; and in 1792, the boundaries of the purchase proper were fixed as follows : the Ohio on the south, the seventh range of townships on the east, the six teenth range on the west, and a line on the north so drawn as to make the grant 750,000 acres, be sides reservations ; this grant being the portion which it was originally agreed the Company might enter into at once. In addition to this, 214,285 acres were granted as army bounties, under the resolutions of 1779 and 1780, and 100,000 acres as bounties to actual settlers; both of the latter tracts being within the original grant of 1787, and adjoining the purchase as before mentioned. While these things were progressing, Congress was bringing into form an ordinance for the gov ernment and social organization of the North west Territory. Virginia made her cession in March, 1784, and during the month following the plan for the temporary government of the newly acquired territory came under discussion. On the 19th of April, Mr. Spaight, of North Carolina, moved to strike from the plan reported by Mr. Jefferson, the emancipationist of his day, a provis ion for the prohibition of slavery north of the Ohio after the year 1800. The motion prevailed. From that day till the 23d, the plan was discussed and altered, and finally passed unanimously with the ex ception of South Carolina. The South would have slavery, or defeat every measure. Thus this hide ous monster early began to assert himself. Ry the proposed plan, the Territory was to have been divided into States by parallels of latitude and merid ian lines. This division, it was thought, would make ten States, whose names were as follows, beginning at the northwest corner, and going southwardly : Sylvania, Michigania, Cheresonisus, Assenispia, Mesopotamia, Illinoia, Saratoga, Washington, Polypotamia and Pelisipia.* A more serious difficulty existed, however, to this plan, than its catalogue of names \u2014 the number of States and their boundaries. The root of the evil was in the resolution passed by Congress in October, * Spark's Washington. an accomplished scholar, an excellent gentleman, and a firm believer in freedom. In the choice of him as the agent of the Company, lies the fact, though unforeseen, of the beginning of anti-slavery in America. Through him the famous \" compact of 1787,\" the true corner-stone of the Northwest, originated, and by him was safely passed. He was a good \"wire-puller,\" too, and in this had an advantage. Mr. Hutchins was at this time the geographer for the United States, and was, prob ably, the best-posted man in America regarding the West. Dr. Cutler learned from him that the most desirable portions were on the Muskingum River, north of the Ohio, and was advised by him to buy there if he could. Congress wanted money badly, and many of the members favored the plan. The Southern mem bers, generally, were hostile to it, as the Doctor would listen to no grant which did not embody the New England ideas in the charter. These members were finally won over, some bribery be ing used, and some of their favorites made officers of the Territory, whose formation was now going on. This took time, however, and Dr. Cutler, be coming impatient, declared they would purchase from some of the States, who held small tracts in various parts of the West. This intimation brought the tardy ones to time, and, on the 23d of July, Congress authorized the Treasury Roard to make the contract. On the 26th, Messrs. Cutler and Sargent, on behalf of the Company, stated in writing their conditions; and on the 27th, Con gress referred their letter to the Roard, and an order of the same date was obtained. Of this Dr. Cutler's journal says: \" Ry this grant we obtained near five millions of acres of land, amounting to $3,500,000; 1,500, 000 acres for the Ohio Company, and the remainder for a private speculation, in which many of the principal characters of America are concerned. Without connecting this peculation, similar terms and advantages for the Ohio Company could not have been obtained.\" Messrs. Cutler and Sargent at once closed a ver bal contract with the Treasury Roard, which was executed in form on the 27th of the next Octo ber.* Ry this contract, the vast region bounded on the south by the Ohio, west by the Scioto, east by the seventh range of townships then surveying, and north by a due west line, drawn from the north * Land Laws."], [77, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 07 1780, which fixed the size of the States to be formed from the ceded lands, at one hundred to one hundred and fifty miles square. The terms of that resolu tion being called up both by Virginia and Massa chusetts, further legislation was deemed necessary to change them. July 7, 1786, this subject came up in Congress, and a resolution passed in favor of a division into not less than three nor more than five States. Virginia, at the close of 1788, assented to this proposition, which became the basis upon which the division should be made. On the 29th of September, Congress having thus changed the plan fbr dividing the Northwestern Territory into ten States, proceeded again to consider the terms of an ordinance for the government of that region. At this juncture, the genius of Dr. Cutler displayed itself. A graduate in medicine, law and divinity ; an ardent lover of liberty ; a celebrated scientist, and an accomplished, portly gentleman, of whom the Southern senators said they had never before seen so fine a specimen from the New England colo nies, no man was better prepared to form a govern ment for the new Territory, than he. The Ohio Company was his real object. He was backed by them, and enough Continental money to purchase more than a million acres of land. This was aug mented by other parties until, as has been noticed, he represented over five million acres. This would largely reduce the public debt. Jefferson and Vir ginia were regarded as authority concerning the land Virginia had just ceded to the General Gov ernment. Jefferson's policy was to provide for the national credit, and still check the growth of slavery. Here was a good opportunity. Massachusetts owned the Territory of Maine, which she was crowd ing into market. She opposed the opening of the Northwest. This stirred Virginia. The South caught the inspiration and rallied around the Old Dominion and Dr. Cutler. Thereby he gained the credit and good will of the South, an auxiliary he used to good purpose. Massachusetts could not vote against him, because many of the constituents of her members were interested in the Ohio Com pany. Thus the Doctor, using all the arts of the lobbyist, was enabled to hold the situation. True to deeper convictions, he dictated one of the most com pact and finished documents of wise statesmanship that has ever adorned any statute-book. Jefferson gave it the term, \"Articles of Compact,\" and rendered him valuable aid -in its construction. This \" Compact\" preceded the Federal Constitution, in both of which are seen Jefferson's master-mind. Dr. Cutler followed closely the constitution of Mas- sachusetts, adopted three years before. The prom inent features were : The exclusion of slavery from the Territory forever. Provision for public schools, giving one township for a seminary, and every six teenth section. (That gave one thirty-sixth of all the land for public education. ) A provision pro hibiting the adoption of any constitution or the enactment of any law that would nullify pre-exist ing contracts. The compact further declared that \" Religion, morality and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall always be en couraged.\" The Doctor planted himself firmly on this plat form, and would not yield. It was that or nothing. Unless they could make the land desirable, it was not wanted, and, taking his horse and buggy, he started for the Constitutional Convention in Phil adelphia. His influence succeeded. On the 13th of July, 1787, the bill was put upon its passage and was unanimously adopted. Every member from the South voted for it ; only one man, Mr. Yates, of New York, voted against the measure ; but as the vote was made by States, his vote was lost, and the \" Compact of 1787 \" was beyond re peal. Thus the great States of the Northwest Territory were consecrated to freedom, intelligence and morality. This act was the opening step for freedom in America. Soon the South saw their blunder, and endeavored, by all their power, to re peal the compact. In 1803, Congress referred it to a committee, of which John Randolph was chairman. He reported the ordinance was a com pact and could not be repealed. Thus it stood, like a rock, in the way of slavery, which still, in spite of these provisions, endeavored to plant that infernal institution in the West. Witness the early days of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. Rut the compact could not be violated ; New England ideas could not be put down, and her sons stood ready to defend the soil of the West from that curse. The passage of the ordinance and the grant of land to Dr. Cutler and his associates, were soon fol lowed by a request from John Cleve Symmes, of New Jersey, for the country between the Miamis. Symmes had visited that part of the West in 1786, and, being pleased with the valleys of the Miamis, had applied to the Board of the Treasury for their purchase, as soon as they were open to set tlement. The Board was empowered to act by Congress, and, in 1788, a contract was signed, giv ing him the country he desired. The terms of his"], [78, "G8 HISTORY OF OHIO. purchase were similar to those of the Ohio Com pany. His application was followed by others, whose success or failure will appear in the narrative. The New England or Ohio Company was all this time busily engaged perfecting its arrange ments to occupy its lands. The Directors agreed to reserve 5,760 acres near the confluence of the Ohio and Muskingum for a city and commons, for the old ideas of the English plan of settling a country yet prevailed. A meeting of the Direct ors was held at Bracket's tavern, in Boston, No vember 23, 1787, when four surveyors, and twen ty-two attendants, boat-builders, carpenters, black smiths and common workmen, numbering in all forty persons, were engaged. Their tools were purchased, and wagons were obtained to transport them across the mountains. Gen. Rufus Putnam was made superintendent of the company, and Ebenezer Sproat, of Rhode Island, Anselm Tup per and John Matthews, from Massachusetts, and R. J. Meigs, from Connecticut, as surveyors. At the same meeting, a suitable person to instruct them in religion, and prepare the way to open a school when needed, was selected. This was Rev. Daniel Storey, who became the first New England minis ter in the Northwest. The Indians were watching this outgrowth of affairs, and felt, from what they could learn in Ken tucky, that they would be gradually surrounded by the whites. This they did not relish, by any means, and gave the settlements south of the Ohio no little uneasiness. It was thought best to hold another treaty with them. In the mean time, to insure peace, the Governor of Virginia, and Con gress, placed troops at Venango, Forts Pitt and Mclntosh, and at Miami, Vincennes, Louisville, and Muskingum, and the militia of Kentucky were held in readiness should a sudden outbreak occur. These measures produced no results, save insuring the safety of the whites, and not until January, 1789, was Clarke able to carry out his plans. During that month, he held a meeting at Fort Harmar,* at the mouth of the Muskingum, where the New England Colony expected to locate. The hostile character of the Indians did not deter the Ohio Company from carrying out its plans. In the winter of 1787, Gen. Rufus Put *Fort Harmar was built in 1785, by a detachment of United States soldiers, under command of Maj. John Doughty. It was named in honor of Col. Josiah Harmar, to whose regiment Maj. Doughty was attached. Tt was the first military post erected by the Americans witl'in the limits of Ohio, except Fort Laurens, a temporary struct ure built in 1778. When Marietta was founded it was the military post of that part of the country, and was for many years an impor tant Btation. nani and forty-seven pioneers advanced to the mouth of the Youghiogheny River, and began building a boat for transportation down the Ohio in the spring. The boat was the largest craft that had ever descended the river, and, in allusion to their Pilgrim Fathers, it was called the Mayflower. It was 45 feet long and 12 feet wide, and esti mated at 50 tons burden. Truly a formidable affair for the time. The bows were raking and curved like a galley, and were strongly timbered. The sides were made bullet-proof, and it was covered with a deck roof. Capt. Devol, the first ship builder in the West, was placed in command. On the 2d of April, /the Mayflower was launched, and for five days the little band of pioneers sailed down the Monongahela and the Ohio, and, on the 7th, landed at the mouth of the Muskingum. There, opposite Fort Harmar, they chose a loca tion, moored their boat for a temporary shelter, and began to erect houses for their occupation. Thus was begun the first English settlement in the Ohio Valley. About the 1st of July, they were re-enforced by the arrival of a colony from Massachusetts. It had been nine weeks on the way. It had hauled its wagons and driven its stock to Wheeling, where, constructing flat-boats, it had floated down the river to the settlement. In October preceding this occurrence, Arthur St. Clair had been appointed Governor of the Ter ritory by Congress, which body also appointed Winthrop Sargent, Secretary, and Samuel H. Parsons, James M. Varnum and John Armstrong Judges. Subsequently Mr. Armstrong declined the appointment, and Mr. Symmes was given the vacancy. None of these were on the ground when the first settlement was made, though the- Judges came soon after. One of the first things the colony found necessary to do was to organize some form of government, whereby difficulties might be settled, though to the credit of the colony it may be said, that during the first three months of its existence but one difference arose, and that was settled by a compromise.* Indeed, hardly a better set of men for the purpose could have been selected. Washington wrote concerning this colony : \"No colony in America was ever settled under such favorable auspices as that which has com menced at the Muskingum. Information, prop erty and strength will be its characteristics. I know many of the settlers personally, and there *\" Western Monthly Magazine.\""], [79, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 69 never were men better calculated to promote the welfare of such a community.\" On the 2d of July, a meeting of the Directors and agents was held on the banks of the Mus kingum for the purpose of naming the newborn city and its squares. As yet, the settlement had been merely \"The Muskingum;\" but the name Marietta was now formally given it, in honor of Marie Antoinette. The square upon which the blockhouses stood was called Campus Martius; Square No. 19, Capitolium; Square No. 61, Ce cilia, and the great road running through the covert-way, Sacra Via* Surely, classical scholars were not scarce in the colony. On the Fourth, an oration was delivered by James M. Varnum, one of the Judges, and a public demonstration held. Five days after, the Governor arrived, and the colony began to assume form. The ordinance of 1787 provided two dis tinct grades of government, under the first of which the whole power was under the Governor and the three Judges. This form was at once recognized on the arrival of St. Clair. The first law established by this court was passed on the 25th of July. It established and regulated the militia of the Territory. The next day after its publication, appeared the Governor's proclamation erecting all the country that had been ceded by the Indians east of the Scioto River, into, the county of Washington. Marietta was, of course, the county seat, and, from that day, went on prosperously. On September 2, the first court was held with becoming ceremonies. It is thus related in the American Pioneer: \"The procession was formed at the Point (where the most of the settlers resided), in the following order: The High Sheriff, with his drawn sword; the citizens; the officers of the garrison at Fort Harmar; the members of the bar ; the Supreme Judges ; the Governor and clergyman ; the newly appointed Judges of the Court of Common Pleas, Gens. Rufus Putnam and Renjamin Tupper. \"They marched up the path that had been cleared through the forest to Campus Martius Hall (stockade), where the whole countermarched, and the Judges (Putnam and Tupper) took their seats. The clergyman, Rev. Dr. Cutler, then invoked the divine blessing. The Sheriff, Col. Ebenezer Sproat, proclaimed with his solemn ' Oh yes ! ' that a court is open for the administration of * \" Carey's Museum,\" Vol. 4. even-handed justice, to the poor and to the rich, to the guilty and to the innocent, without respect of persons ; none to be punished without a trial of their peers, and then in pursuance of the laws and evidence in the case. \" Although this scene was exhibited thus early in the settlement of the West, few ever equaled it in the dignity and exalted character of its princi pal participators. Many of them belonged to the history of our country in the darkest, as well as the most splendid, period of the Revolutionary war.\" Many Indians were gathered at the same time to witness the (to them) strange spectacle, and for the purpose of forming a treaty, though how far they carried this out, the Pioneer does not relate. The progress of the settlement was quite satis factory during the year. Some one writing a letter from the town says: \"The progress of the settlement is sufficiently rapid for the first year. We are continually erect ing houses, but arrivals are constantly coming faster than we can possibly provide convenient covering. Our first ball was opened about the middle of December, at which were fifteen ladies, as well accomplished in the manner of polite circles as any I have ever seen in the older States. I mention this to show the progress of society in this new world, where, I believe, we shall vie with, if not excel, the old States in every accom plishment necessary to render life agreeable and happy.\" The emigration westward at this time was, indeed, exceedingly large. The commander at Fort Harmar reported 4,500 persons as having passed that post between February and June, 1788, many of whom would have stopped there, had the associates been prepared to receive them. The settlement was free from Indian depredations until January, 1791, during which interval it daily increased in numbers and strength. Symmes and his friends were not idle during this time. He had secured his contract in October, 1787, and, soon after, issued a pamphlet stating the terms of his purchase and the mode he intended to follow in the disposal of the lands. His plan was, to issue warrants for not less than one-quarter section, which might be located anywhere, save on reservations, or on land previously entered. The locator could enter an entire section should he de sire to do so. The price was to be 60f cents per acre till May, 1788 ; then, till November, $1 ; and"], [80, "70 HISTORY OF OHIO. after that time to be regulated by the demand for land. Each purchaser was bound to begin im provements within two years, or forfeit one-sixth of the land to whoever would settle thereon and remain seven years. Military bounties might be taken in this, as in the purchase of the associates. For himself, Symmes reserved one township near the mouth of the Miami. On this he intended to build a great city, rivaling any Eastern port. He offered any one a lot on which to build a house, providing he would remain three years. Conti nental certificates were rising, owing to the demand for land created by these two purchases, and Con gress found the burden of debt correspondingly lessened. Symmes soon began to experience diffi culty in procuring enough to meet his payments. He had also some trouble in arranging his boundary with the Roard of the Treasury. These, and other causes, laid the foundation for another city, which is now what Symmes hoped his city would one day be. In January, 1788, Mathias Denman, of New Jersey, took an interest in Symmes' purchase, and located, among other tracts, the sections upon which Cincinnati has since been built. Retaining one-third of this purchase, he sold the balance to Robert Patterson and John Filson, each getting the same share. These three, about August, agreed to lay out a town on their land. It was designated as opposite the mouth of the Licking River, to which place it was intended to open a road from Lexington, Ky. These men little thought of the great emporium that now covers the modest site of this town they laid out that summer. Mr. Filson, who had been a schoolmaster, and was of a some what poetic nature, was appointed to name the town. In respect to its situation, and as if with a prophetic perception of the mixed races that were in after years to dwell there, he named it Los antiville,* \" which, being interpreted,\" says the \" Western Annals,\" \" means ville, the town ; anti, opposite to ; os, the mouth ; L, of Licking. This may well put to the blush the Campus Martius of the Marietta scholars, and the Fort Solon of the Spaniards.\" Meanwhile, Symmes was busy in the East, and, by July, got thirty people and eight four-horse wagons under way for the West. These reached Limestone by September, where they met Mr. Stites, with several persons from Redstone. All \u2666Judge Burnett, in his notes, disputes the above account of the origin of the city of Cincinnati. He says the name \"Losantiville\" was determined on, but not adopted, when the town was laid out. This version is probably the correct one, and will be found fully given in the detailed history of the settlements. came to Symmes' purchase, and began to look for homes. Symmes' mind was, however, ill at rest. He could not meet his first payment on sovastarealm, and there also arose a difference of opinion be tween him and the Treasury Roard regarding the Ohio boundary. Symmes wanted all the land be tween the two Miamis, bordering on the Ohio, while the Roard wished him confined to no more than twenty miles of the river. To this proposal he would not agree, as he had made sales all along the river. Leaving the bargain in an unsettled state, Congress considered itself released from all its obligations, and, but for the representations of many of Symmes' friends, he would have lost all his money and labor. His appointment as Judge was not favorably received by many, as they thought that by it he would acquire unlimited power. Some of his associates also complained of him, and, for awhile, it surely seemed that ruin only awaited him. Rut he was brave and hope ful, and determined to succeed. On his return from a visit to his purchase in September, 1788, he wrote Jonathan Dayton, of New Jersey, one of his best friends and associates, that he thought some of the land near the Great Miami \" positively worth a silver dollar the acre in its present state.\" A good many changes were made in his original contract, growing out of his inability to meet his payments. At first, he was to have not less than a million acres, under an act of Congress passed in October, 1787, authorizing the Treasury Roard to contract with any one who could pay for such tracts, on the Ohio and Wabash Rivers, whose fronts should not exceed one-third of their depth. Dayton and Marsh, Symmes' agents, contracted with the Roard for one tract on the Ohio, begin ning twenty miles up the Ohio from the mouth of the Great Miami, and to run back for quantity be tween the Miami and a line drawn from the Ohio, parallel to the general course of that river. In 1791, three years after Dayton and Marsh made the contract, Symmes found this would throw the purchase too far back from the Ohio, and applied to Congress to let him have all between the Mi amies, running back so as to include 1,000,000 acres, which that body, on April 12, 1792, agreed to do. When the lands were surveyed, however, it was found that a line drawn from the head of the Little Miami due west to the Great Miami, would include south of it less than six hundred thousand acres. Even this Symmes could not pay for, and when his patent was issued in September, 1794, it"], [81, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 71 Mr. Filson named the town. It is further to be noticed, that, before the town was located by Mr. Ludlow and Mr. Patterson, Mr. Filson had been killed by the Miami Indians, and, as he had not paid for his one-third of the site, the claim was sold to Mr. Ludlow, who thereby became one of the origi nal owners of the place. Just what day the town was laid out is not recorded. All the evidence tends to show it must have been late in 1788, or early in 1789. While the settlements on the north side of the Ohio were thus progressing, south of it fears of the Indians prevailed, and the separation sore was kept open. The country was, however, so torn by internal factions that no plan was likely to suc ceed, and to this fact, in a large measure, may be credited the reason it did not secede, or join the Spanish or French faction, both of which were intriguing to get the commonwealth. During this year the treasonable acts of James Wilkinson came into view. For a while he thought success was in his grasp, but the two governments were at peace with America, and discountenanced any such efforts. Wilkinson, like all traitors, relapsed into nonentity, and became mistrusted by the govern ments he attempted to befriend. Treason is al ways odious. It will be borne in mind, that in 1778 prepa rations had been made for a treaty with the Indi ans, to secure peaceful possession of the lands owned in the West. Though the whites held these by purchase and treaty, yet many Indians, especially the Wabash and some of the Miami In dians, objected to their occupation, claiming the Ohio boundary as the original division line. Clarke endeavored to obtain, by treaty at Fort Harmar, in 1778, a confirmation of these grants, but was not able to do so till January, 9, 1789. Rep resentatives of the Six Nations, and of the Wyan dots, Delawares, Ottawas, Chippewas, Pottawato mies and Sacs, met him at this date, and confirmed and extended the treaties of Fort Stanwix and Fort Mclntosh, the one in 1784, the other in 1785. This secured peace with the most of them, save a few of the Wabash Indians, whom they were compelled to conquer by arms. When this was accomplished, the borders were thought safe, and Virginia proposed to withdraw her aid in sup port of Kentucky. This opened old troubles, and the separation dogma came out afresh. Virginia offered to allow the erection of a separate State, providing Kentucky would assume part of the old debts. This the young commonwealth would not gave him and his associates 248,540 acres, exclu sive of reservations which amounted to 63,142 acres. This tract was bounded by the Ohio, the two Miamis and a due east and west line run so as to include the desired quantity. Symmes, how ever, made no further payments, and the rest of his purchase reverted to the United States, who gave those who had bought under him ample pre emption rights. The Government was able, also, to give him and his colonists but little aid, and as danger from hos tile Indians was in a measure imminent (though all the natives were friendly to Symmes), settlers were slow to come. However, the band led by Mr. Stites arrived before the 1st of January, 1789, and locating themselves near the mouth of the Little Miami, on a tract of 10,000 acres which Mr. Stites had purchased from Symmes, formed the second settlement in Ohio. They were soon afterward joined by a colony of twenty-six persons, who assisted them to erect a block-house, and gather their corn. The town was named Columbia. While here, the great flood of January, 1789, oc curred, which did much to ensure the future growth of Losantiville, or more properly, Cincin nati. Symmes City, which was laid out near the mouth of the Great Miami, and which he vainly strove to make the city of the future, Marietta and Columbia, all suffered severely by this flood, the greatest, the Indians said, ever known. The site of Cincinnati was not overflowed, and hence attracted the attention of the settlers. Denman's warrants had designated his purchase as opposite the mouth of the^Licking; and that point escap ing the overflow, late in December the place was visited by Israel Ludlow, Symmes' surveyor, Mr. Patterson and Mr. Denman, and about fourteen oth ers, who left Maysville to \"form a station and lay off a town opposite the Licking.\" The river was filled with ice \"from shore to shore;\" but, says Symmes in May, 1789, \"Perseverance triumphing over difficulty, and they landed safe on a most de lightful bank of the Ohio, where they founded the town of Losantiville, which populates consid erably.\" The settlers of Losantiville built a few lo\u00b0- huts and block-houses, and proceeded to im prove the town. Symmes, noticing the location, says: \"Though they placed their dwellings in the most marked position, yet they suffered nothing from the freshet.\" This would seem to give cre dence to Judge Burnett's notes regarding the origin of Cincinnati, who states the settlement was made at this time, and not at the time mentioned when"], [82, "72 HISTORY OF OHIO. walls of one of their vast temples. Another fact is given in relation to the erection of Fort Wash- ington at Losantiville, which partakes somewhat of romance. The Major, while waiting to decide at which place the fort should be built, happened to make the acquaintance of a black-eyed beauty, the wife of one of the residents. Her husband, notic- ing the affair, removed her to Losantiville. The Major followed; he told Symmes he wished to see how a fort would do there, but promised to give his city the preference. He found the beauty there, and on his return Symmes could not prevail on him to remain. If the story be true, then the importance of Cincinnati owes its existence to a trivial circum- stance, and the old story of the ten years' war which terminated in the downfall of Troy, which is said to have originated owing to the beauty of a Spartan dame, was re-enacted here. Troy and North Rend fell because of the beauty of a wo- man ; Cincinnati was the result of the downfall of the latter place. About the first of January, 1790, Governor St. Clair, with his officers, descended the Ohio River from Marietta to Fort Washington. There he es- tablished the county of Hamilton, comprising the immense region of country contiguous to the Ohio, from the Hocking River to the Great Miami; appointed a corps of civil and military officers, and established a Court of Quarter Ses- sions. Some state that at this time, he changed the name of the village of Losantiville to Cin- cinnati, in allusion to a society of that name which had recently been formed among the officers of the Revolutionary army, and established it as the seat of justice for Hamilton. This latter fact is certain; but as regards changing the name of the village, there is no good authority for it. With this importance attached to it, Cincinnati began at once an active growth, and from that day Cleves' city declined. The next summer, frame houses began to appear in Cincinnati, while at the same time forty new log cabins appeared about the fort. On the 8th of January, the Governor arrived at the falls of the Ohio, on his way to establish a government at Vincennes and Kaskaskia. From Clarkesville, he dispatched a messenger to Major Hamtramck, commander at Vincennes, with speeches to the various Indian tribes in this part of the Northwest, who had not fully agreed to the treaties. St. Clair and Sargent followed in a few days, along an Indian trail to Vincennes, where he organized the county of Knox, comprish- all the do, and sent a remonstrance. Virginia withdrew the proposal, and ordered a ninth convention, which succeeded in evolving a plan whereby Ken tucky took her place among the free States of the Union. North of the Ohio, the prosperity continued. In 1789, Rev. Daniel Story, who had been ap pointed missionary to the West, came out as a teacher of the youth and a preacher of the Gospel. Dr. Cutler had preceded him, not in the capacity of a minister, though he had preached ; hence Mr. Story is truly the first missionary from the Prot estant Church who came to the Ohio Valley in that capacity. When he came, in 1789, he found nine associations on the Ohio Company's purchase, comprising two hundred and fifty persons in all ; and, by the close of 1790, eight settlements had been made: two at Relpre (belle prairie), one at Newbury, one at Wolf Creek, one at Duck Creek, one at the mouth of Meigs' Creek, one at Ander son's Rottom, and one at Rig Rottom. An ex tended sketch of all these settlements will be found farther on in this volume. Symmes had, all this time, strenuously endeav ored to get his city \u2014 called Cleves City \u2014 favorably noticed, and filled with people. He saw a rival in Cincinnati. That place, if made military head quarters to protect the Miami Valley, would out rival his town, situated near the bend of the Miami, near its mouth. On the 15th of June, Judge Symmes received news that the Wabash Indians threatened the Miami settlements, and as he had received only nineteen men for defense, he applied for more. Refore July, Maj. Doughty arrived at the \"Slaughter House\" \u2014 as the Miami was sometimes called, owing to previous murders that had, at former times, occurred therein. Through the influence of Symmes, the detach ment landed at the North Rend, and, for awhile, it was thought the fort would be erected there. This was what Symmes wanted, as it would secure him the headquarters of the military, and aid in getting the headquarters of the civil gov ernment. The truth was, however, that neither the proposed city on the Miami \u2014 North Rend, as it afterward became known, from its location \u2014 or South Rend, could compete, in point of natural advantages, with the plain on which Cincinnati is built. Had Fort Washington been built elsewhere, aster the close of the Indian war, nature would have asserted her advantages, and insured the growth of a city, where even the ancient and mys terious dwellers of the Ohio had reared the earthen"], [83, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 73 country along the Ohio, from the Miami to the Wabash, and made Vincennes the county seat. Then they proceeded across the lower part of Illi nois to Kaskaskia, where he established the county of St. Clair (so named by Sargent), comprising all the country from the Wabash to the Mississippi. Thus the Northwest was divided into three coun ties, and courts established therein. St. Clair called upon the French inhabitants at Vincennes and in the Illinois country, to show the titles to their lands, and also to defray the expense of a survey. To this latter demand they replied through their priest, Pierre Gibault, showing their poverty, and inability to comply. They were confirmed in their grants, and, as they had been good friends to the patriot cause, were relieved from the expense of the survey. While the Governor was managing these affairs, Major Hamtramck was engaged in an effort to con ciliate the Wabash Indians. For this purpose, he sent Antoine Gamelin, an intelligent French mer chant, and a true friend of America, among them to carry messages sent by St. Clair and the Govern ment, and to learn their sentiments and dispositions. Gamelin performed this important mission in the spring of 1790 with much sagacity, and, as the French were good friends of the natives, he did much to conciliate these half-hostile tribes. He visited the towns of these tribes along the Wabash and as far north and east as the Miami village, Ke-ki-ong-ga \u2014 St. Mary's \u2014 at the junction of the St. Mary's and St. Joseph's Rivers (Fort Wayne). Gamelin's report, and the intelligence brought by some traders from the Upper Wabash, were con veyed to the Governor at Kaskaskia. The reports convinced him that the Indians of that part of the Northwest were preparing for a war on the settle ments north of the Ohio, intending, if possible, to drive them south of it; that river being still consid ered by them as the true boundary. St. Clair left the administration of affairs in the Western counties to Sargent, and returned at once to Fort Washing ton to provide for the defense of the frontier. The Indians had begun their predatory incur sions into the country settled by the whites, and had committed some depredations. The Kentuck ians were enlisted in an attack against the Scioto Indians. April 18, Gen. Harmar, with 100 regulars, and Gen. Scott, with 230 volunteers, marched from Limestone, by a circuitous route, to the Scioto, accomplishing but little. The savages had fled. CHAPTER VII. THE INDIAN WAR OF 1795 \u2014 HARMAR'S CAMPAIGN\u2014 ST. CLAIR'S CAMPAIGN\u2014 WAYNE'S CAMPAIGN\u2014 CLOSE OF THE WAR. A GREAT deal of the hostility at this period was directly traceable to the British. They yet held Detroit and several posts on the lakes, in violation of the treaty of 1783. They alleged as a reason for not abandoning them, that the Ameri cans had not fulfilled the conditions of the treaty regarding the collection of debts. Moreover, they did all they could to remain at the frontier and en joy the emoluments derived from the fur trade. That they aided the Indians in the conflict at this time, is undeniable. Just how, it is difficult to say. But it is well known the savages had all the ammunition and fire-arms they wanted, more than they could have obtained from American and French renegade traders. They were also well supplied with clothing, and were able to prolong the war some time. A great confederation was on the eve of formation. The leading spirits were Cornplanter, Brant, Little Turtle and other noted chiefs, and had not the British, as Brant said, \"encouraged us to the war, and promised us aid, and then, when we were driven away by the Amer icans, shut the doors of their fortresses against us and refused us food, when they saw us nearly con quered, we would have effected our object.\" MeKee, Elliott and Girty were also actively en gaged in aiding the natives. All of them were in the interest of the British, a fact clearly proven by the Indians themselves, and by other traders. St. Clair and Gen. Harmar determined to send an expedition against the Maumee towns, and se cure that part of the country. Letters were sent to the militia officers of Western Pennsylvania, Virginia and Kentucky, calling on them for militia to co-operate with the regular troops in the cam paisn. According to the plan of the campaign,"], [84, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 74 300 militia were to rendezvous at Fort Steuben ( Jefferson ville), march thence to Fort Knox, at Vincennes, and join Maj. Hamtramck in an expe dition up the Wabash ; 700 were to rendezvous at Fort Washington to join the regular army against the Maumee towns. While St. Clair was forming his army and ar ranging for the campaign, three expeditions were sent out against the Miami towns. One against the Miami villages, not far from the Wabash, was led by Gen. Harmar. He had in his army about fourteen hundred men, regulars and militia. These two parts of the army could not be made to affili ate, and, as a consequence, the expedition did little beyond burning the villages and destroying corn. The militia would not submit to discipline, and would not serve under regular officers. It will be seen what this spirit led to when St. Clair went on his march soon after. The Indians, emboldened by the meager success of Harmar's command, continued their depreda dations against the Ohio settlements, destroying the community at Rig Rottom. To hold them in check, and also punish them, an army under Charles Scott went against the Wabash Indians. Little was done here but destroy towns and the standing corn. In July, another army, under Col. Wilkin son, was sent against the Eel River Indians. Re coming entangled in extensive morasses on the river, the army became endangered, but was finally extricated, and accomplished no more than either the other armies before it. As it was, however, the three expeditions directed against the Miamis and Shawanees, served only to exasperate them. The burning of their towns, the destruction of their corn, and the captivity of their women and chil dren, only aroused them to more desperate efforts to defend their country and to harass their in vaders. To accomplish this, the chiefs of the Miamis, Shawanees and the Delawares, Little Turtle, Rlue Jacket and Ruckongahelas, were en gaged in forming a confederacy of all the tribes of the Northwest, strong enough to drive the whites beyond the Ohio. Pontiac had tried that before, even when he had open allies among the French. The Indians now had secret allies among the Rrit ish, yet, in the end, they did not succeed. While they were preparing for the contest, St. Clair was gathering his forces, intending to erect a chain of forts from the Ohio, by way of the Miami and Maumee valleys, to the lakes, and thereby effect ually hold the savages in check. Washington warmly seconded this plan, and designated the junction of the St. Mary's and St. Joseph's Rivers as an important post. This had been a fortification almost from the time the English held the valley, and only needed little work to make it a formid able fortress. Gen. Knox, the Secretary of War, also favored the plan, and gave instructions con cerning it. Under these instructions, St. Clair organized his forces as rapidly as he could, although the numerous drawbacks almost, at times, threat ened the defeat of the campaign. Through the summer the arms and accouterments of the army were put in readiness at Fort Washington. Many were found to be of the poorest quality, and to be badly out of repair. The militia came poorly armed, under the impression they were to be pro vided with arms. While waiting in camp, habits of idleness engendered themselves, and drunken ness followed. They continued their accustomed freedom, disdaining to drill, and refused to submit to the regular officers. A bitter spirit broke out between the regular troops and the militia, which none could heal. The insubordination of the mi litia and their officers, caused them a defeat after ward, which they in vain attempted to fasten on the busy General, and the regular troops. The army was not ready to move till September 17. It was then 2,300 strong. It then moved to a point upon the Great Miami, where they erected Fort Hamilton, the first in the proposed chain of fortresses. After its completion, they moved on forty-four miles farther, and, on the 12th of October, began the erection of Fort Jefferson, about six miles south of the present town of Green ville, Darke County. On the 24th, the army again took up its line of march, through a wilderness, marshy and boggy, and full of savage foes. The army rapidly declined under the hot sun ; even the commander was suffering from an indisposition. The militia deserted, in companies at a time, leav ing the bulk of the work to the regular troops. By the 3d of November, the army reached a stream twelve yards wide, which St. Clair sup posed to be a branch of the St. Mary of the Mau mee, but which in reality was a tributary of the Wabash. Upon the banks of that stream, the army, now about fourteen hundred strong, en camped in two lines. A slight protection was thrown up as a safeguard against the Indians, who were known to be in the neighborhood. The Gen eral intended to attack them next day, but, about half an hour before sunrise, just after the militia had been dismissed from parade, a sudden attack was made upon them. The militia were thrown"], [85, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 75 into confusion, and disregarded the command of the officers. They had not been sufficiently drilled, and now was seen, too late and too plainly, the evil effects of their insubordination. Through the morning the battle waged furiously, the men falling by scores. About nine o'clock the retreat began, covered by Maj. Cook and his troops. The re treat was a disgraceful, precipitate flight, though, after four miles had been passed, the enemy re turned to the work of scalping the dead and wounded, and of pillaging the camp. Through the day and the night their dreadful work con tinued, one squaw afterward declaring \" her arm was weary scalping the white men.\" The army reached Fort Jefferson a little after sunset, having thrown away much of its arms and baggage, though the act was entirely unnecessary. After remain ing here a short time, it was decided by the officers to move on toward Fort Hamilton, and thence to Fort Washington. The defeat of St. Clair was the most terrible re verse the Americans ever suffered from the Indi ans. It was greater than even Rraddock's defeat. His army consisted of 1,200 men and 86 officers, of whom 714 men and 63 officers were killed or wounded. St. Clair's army consisted of 1,400 men and 86 officers, of whom 890 men and 16 officers were killed or wounded. The comparative effects of the. two engagements very inadequately represent the crushing effect of St. Clair's defeat. An unprotected frontier of more than a thousand miles in extent was now thrown open to a foe made merciless, and anxious to drive the whites from the north side of the Ohio. Now, settlers were scat tered along all the streams, and in all the forests, ex posed to the cruel enemy, who stealthily approached the homes of the pioneer, to murder him and his family. Loud calls arose from the people to defend and protect them. St. Clair was covered with abuse for his defeat, when he really was not alone to blame for it. The militia would not be controlled. Had Clarke been at their head, or Wayne, who succeeded St. Clair, the result might have been different. As it was, St. Clair resigned ; though ever after he en joyed the confidence of Washington and Congress. Four days after the defeat of St. Clair, the army, in its straggling condition, reached Fort Washing ton, and paused to rest. On the 9th, St. Clair wrote fully to the Secretary of War. On the 12th, Gen. Knox communicated the information to Con gress, and on the 26th, he laid before the Presi dent two reports, the second containing sugges tions regarding future operations. His sugges- tions urged the establishment of a strong United States Army, as it was plain the States could not control the matter. He also urged a thorough drill of the soldiers. No more insubordination could be tolerated. General Wayne was selected by Washington as the commander, and at once pro ceeded to the task assigned to him. In June, 1792, he went to Pittsburgh to organize the army now gathering, which was to be the ultimate argu ment with the Indian confederation. Through the summer he was steadily at work. \"Train and dis cipline them for the work they are meant for,\" wrote Washington, \"and do not spare powder and lead, so the men be made good marksmen.\" In December, the forces, now recruited and trained, gathered at a point twenty-two miles below Pitts burgh, on the Ohio, called Legionville, the army itself being denominated the Legion of the United States, divided into four sub-legions, and provided with the proper officers. Meantime, Col. Wilkinson succeeded St. Clair as commander at Fort Wash ington, and sent out a force to examine the field of defeat, and bury the dead. A shocking sight met their view, revealing the deeds of cruelty enacted upon their comrades by the savage enemy. While Wayne's army was drilling, peace meas ures were pressed forward by the United States with equal perseverance. The Iroquois were in duced to visit Philadelphia, and partially secured from the general confederacy. They were wary, however, and, expecting aid from the British, held aloof. Brant did not come, as was hoped, and it Was plain there was intrigue somewhere. Five independent embassies were sent among the West ern tribes, to endeavor to prevent a war, and win over the inimical tribes. But the victories they had won, and the favorable whispers of the British agents, closed the ears of the red men, and all propositions were rejected in some form or other. All the embassadors, save Putnam, suffered death. He alone was able to reach his goal \u2014 the Wabash Indians \u2014 and effect any treaty. On the 27th of December, in company with Heckewelder, the Mo ravian missionary, he reached Vincennes, and met thirty-one chiefs, representing the Weas, Pianke shaws, Kaskaskias, Peorias, Illinois, Pottawatomies, Mascoutins, Kickapoos and Eel River Indians, and concluded a treaty of peace with them. The fourth article of this treaty, however, con tained a provision guaranteeing to the Indians their lands, and when the treaty was laid before Congress, February 13, 1793, that body, after much discussion, refused on that account to ratify it."], [86, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 70 A great council of the Indians was to be held at Auglaize during the autumn of 1792, when the assembled nations were to discuss fully their means of defense, and determine their future line of action. The council met in October, and was the largest Indian gathering of the time. The chiefs of all the tribes of the Northwest were there. The representatives of the seven nations of Canada, were in attendance. Cornplanter and forty-eight chiefs of the New York (Six Nations) Indians re paired thither. \" Resides these,\" said Cornplanter, \"there were so many nations we cannot tell the names of them. There were three men from the Gora nation ; it took them a whole season to come ; and,\" continued he, \"twenty-seven nations from beyond Canada were there.\" The question of peace or war was long and earnestly debated. Their future was solemnly discussed, and around the council fire native eloquence and native zeal shone in all their simple strength. One nation after another, through their chiefs, presented their views. The deputies of the Six Nations, who had been at Philadelphia to consult the \"Thirteen Fires,\" made their report. The Western bound ary was the principal question. The natives, with one accord, declared it must be the Ohio River. An address was prepared, and sent to the President, wherein their views were stated, and agreeing to abstain from all hostilities, until they could meet again in the spring at the rapids of the Maumee, and there consult with their white brothers. They desired the President to send agents, \"who are men of honesty, not proud land-jobbers, but men who love and desire peace.\" The good work of Penn was evidenced here, as they desired that the embassadors \"be accompanied by some Friend or Quaker.\" The armistice they had promised was not, how ever, faithfully kept. On the 6th of November, a detachment of Kentucky cavalry at Fort St. Clair, about twenty-five miles above Fort Hamil ton, was attacked. The commander, Maj. Adair, was an excellent officer, well versed in Indian tac tics, and defeated the savages. This infraction of their promises did not deter the United States from taking measures to meet the Indians at the rapids of the Maumee \" when the leaves were fully out.\" For that purpose, the President selected as commissioners, Charles Car roll and Charles Thompson, but, as they declined the nomination, he appointed Renjamin Lincoln, Reverly Randolph and Timothy Pickering, the 1st of March, 1793, to attend the convention, which, it was thought best, should be held at the San dusky outpost. About the last of April, these commissioners left Philadelphia, and, late in May, reached Niagara, where they remained guests of Lieut. Gov. Simcoe, of the Rritish Government. This officer gave them all the aid he could, yet it was soon made plain to them that he would not object to the confederation, nay, even rather fav ored it. They speak of his kindness to them, in grateful terms. Gov. Simcoe advised the Indians to make peace, but not to give up any of their lands. That was the pith of the whole matter. The Rritish rather claimed land in New York, under the treaty of 1783, alleging the Americans had not fully complied with the terms of that treaty, hence they were not as anxious for peace and a peaceful settlement of the difficult boundary question as they sometimes represented. Ry July, \"the leaves were fully out,\" the con ferences among the tribes were over, and, on the 15th of that month, the commissioners met Rrant and some fifty natives. In a strong speech, Rrant set forth their wishes, and invited them to accom pany him to the place of holding the council. The Indians were rather jealous of Wayne's continued preparations for war, hence, just before setting out for the Maumee, the commissioners sent a letter to the Secretary of War, asking that all warlike demonstrations cease until the result of their mis sion be known. On 21st of July, the embassy reached the head of the Detroit River, where their advance was checked by the Rritish authorities at Detroit, com pelling them to take up their abode at the house of Andrew Elliott, the famous renegade, then a Rritish agent under Alexander McKee. McKee was attending the council, and the commissioners addressed him a note, borne by Elliott, to inform him of their arrival, and asking when they could be received. Elliott returned on the 29th, bring ing with him a deputation of twenty chiefs from the council. The next day, a conference was held, and the chief of the Wyandots, Sa-wagh-da-wunk, presented to the commissioners, in writing, their explicit demand in regard to the boundary, and their purposes and powers. \" The Ohio must be the boundary,\" said he, \" or blood will flow.\" The commissioners returned an answer to the proposition brought by the chiefs, recapitulating the treaties already made, and denying the Ohio as the boundary line. On the 16th of August, the council sent them, by two Wyandot runners, a final answer, in which they recapitulated their"], [87, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 77 former assertions, and exhibited great powers of reasoning and clear logic in defense of their po sition. The commissioners reply that it is impos ble to accept the Ohio as the boundary, and declare the negotiation at an end. This closed the efforts of the Government to ne gotiate with the Indians, and there remained of necessity no other mode of settling the dispute but war. Liberal terms had been offered them, but nothing but the boundary of the Ohio River would suffice. It was the only condition upon which the confederation would lay down its arms. \" Among the rude statesmen of the wilderness, there was exhibited as pure patriotism and as lofty devotion to the good of their race, as ever won ap plause among civilized men. The white man had, ever since he came into the country, been encroach ing on their lands. He had long occupied the regions beyond the mountains. He had crushed the conspiracy formed by Pontiac, thirty years be fore, fie had taken possession of the common hunting-ground of all the tribes, on the faith of treaties they did not acknowledge. He was now laying out settlements and building forts in the heart of the country to which all the tribes had been driven, and which now was all they could call their own. And now they asked that it should be guaranteed to them, that the boundary which they had so long asked for should be drawn, and a final end be made to the continual aggressions of the whites ; or, if not, they solemnly determined to stake their, all, against fearful odds, in defense of their homes, their country and the inheritance of their children. Nothing could be more patriotic than the position they occupied, and nothing could be more noble than the declarations of their council.\"* They did not know the strength of the whites, and based their success on the victories already gained. They hoped, nay, were promised, aid from the Rritish, and even the Spanish had held out to them assurances of help when the hour of conflict came. The Americans were not disposed to yield even to the confederacy of the tribes backed by the two rival nations, forming, as Wayne characterized it, a \" hydra of Rritish, Spanish and Indian hostility.\" On the 16th of August, the commissioners re ceived the final answer of the council. The 17th, they lest the mouth of the Detroit River, and the 23d, arrived at Fort Erie, where they immediately * Annals of the West. dispatched messengers to Gen. Wayne to inform him of the issue of the negotiation. Wayne had spent the winter of 1792-93, at Legionville, in col lecting and organizing his army. April 30, 1793, the army moved down the river and encamped at a point, called by the soldiers \" Hobson's choice,\" because from the extreme height of the river they were prevented from landing elsewhere. Here Wayne was engaged, during the negotiations for peace, in drilling his soldiers, in cutting roads, and collecting supplies for the army. He was ready for an immediate campaign in case the council failed in its object. While here, he sent a letter to the Secretary of War, detailing the circumstances, and suggesting the probable course he should follow. He re mained here during the summer, and, when apprised of the issue, saw it was too late to attempt the campaign then. He sent the Kentucky militia home, and, with his regular soldiers, went into winter quarters at a fort he built on a tributary of the Great Miami. He called the fort Green ville. The present town of Greenville is near the site of the fort. During the winter, he sent a de tachment to visit the scene of St. Clair's defeat. They found more than six hundred skulls, and were obliged to \"scrape the bones together and carry them out to get a place to make their beds.\" They buried all they could find. Wayne was steadily preparing his forces, so as to have every thing ready for a sure blow when the time came. All his information showed the faith in the British which still animated the doomed red men, and gave them a hope that could end only in defeat. The conduct of the Indians fully corroborated the statements received by Gen. Wayne. On the 30th of June, an escort of ninety riflemen and fifty dragoons, under commandos Maj. Mc-Mahon, was attacked under the walls of Fort Recovery by a force of more than one thousand Indians under charge of Little Turtle. They were repulsed and badly defeated, and, the next day, driven away. Their mode of action, their arms and ammunition, all told plainly of British aid. They also ex pected to find the cannon lost by St. Clair Novem ber 4, 1791, but which the Americans had secured. The 26th of July, Gen. Scott, with 1,600 mounted men from Kentucky, joined Gen. Wayne at Fort Greenville, and, two days after, the legion moved forward. The 8th of August, the army reached the junction of the Auglaize and Mau mee, and at once proceeded to erect Fort Defiance, where the waters meet. The Indians had abandoned"], [88, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 78 their towns on the approach of the army, and were congregating further northward. While engaged on Fort Defiance, Wayne received continual and full reports of the Indians \u2014 of their aid from Detroit and elsewhere ; of the nature of the ground, and the circumstances, favorable or unfavorable. From all he could learn, and considering the spirits of his army, now thoroughly disciplined, he determined to march forward and settle matters at once. Yet, true to his own instincts, and to the measures of peace so forcibly taught by Washington, he sent Christopher Miller, who had been naturalized among the Shawanees, and taken prisoner by Wayne's spies, as a messenger of peace, offering terms of friendship. Unwilling to waste time, the troops began to move forward the 15th of August, and the next day met Miller with the message that if the Amer icans would wait ten days at Auglaize the Indians would decide for peace or war. Wayne knew too well the Indian character, and answered the mes sage by simply marching on. The ISth, the legion had advanced forty-one miles from Auglaize, and, being near the long-looked-for foe, began to take some measures for protection, should they be at tacked. A slight breastwork, called Fort Deposit, was erected, wherein most of their heavy baggage was placed. They remained here, building their works, until the 20th, when, storing their baggage, the army began again its march. After advancing about five miles, they met a large force of the ene my, two thousand strong, who fiercely attacked them. Wayne was, however, prepared, and in the short battle that ensued they were routed, and large numbers slain. The American loss was very slight. The horde of savages were put to flight, leaving the Americans victorious almost under the walls of the British garrison, under Maj. Campbell. This officer sent a letter to Gen. Wayne, asking an explanation of his conduct in fighting so near, and in such evident hostility to the British. Wayne replied, telling him he was in a country that did not belong to him, and one he was not authorized to hold, and also charging him with aiding the Indians. A spirited corre spondence followed, which ended in the American commander marching on, and devastating the In dian country, even burning MeKee's house and stores under the muzzles of the English guns. The 14ih of September, the army marched from Fort Defiance for the Miami village at the junc tion of the St. Mary's and St. Joseph Rivers. It reached there on the 17th, and the next day Gen. Wayne selected a site for a fort. The 22d of Oc tober, the fort was completed, and garrisoned by a detachment under Maj. Hamtramck, who gave to it the name of Fort Wayne. The 14th of October, the mounted Kentucky volunteers, who had be come dissatisfied and mutinous, were started to Fort Washington, where they were immediately mustered out of service and discharged. The 28th of October, the legion marched from Fort Wayne to Fort Greenville, where Gen. Wayne at once established his headquarters. The campaign had been decisive and short, and had taught the Indians a severe lesson. The Brit ish, too, had failed them in their hour of need, and now they began to see they had a foe to contend whose resources were exhaustless. Under these circumstances, losing faith in the English, and at last impressed with a respect for American power, after the defeat experienced at the hands of the \"Black Snake,\" the various tribes made up their minds, by degrees, to ask for peace. During the winter and spring, they exchanged prisoners, and made ready to meet Gen. Wayne at Greenville, in June, for the purpose of forming a definite treaty, as it had been agreed should be done by the pre liminaries of January 24. During the month of June, 1795, representa tives of the Northwestern tribes began to gather at Greenville, and, the 16th of the month, Gen. Wayne met in council the Delawares, Ottawas, Pottawato mies and Eel River Indians, and the conferences, which lasted till August 10, began. The 21st of June, Buckongahelas arrived ; the 23d, Little Turtle and other Miamis ; the 13th of July, Tarhe and other Wyandot chiefs ; and the 18th, Blue Jacket, and thirteen Shawanees and Massas with twenty Chippewas. Most of these, as it appeared by their statements, had been tampered with by the English, especially by McKee, Girty and Brant, even after the pre liminaries of January 24, and while Mr. Jay was perfecting his treaty. They had, however, all de termined to make peace with the \"Thirteen Fires,\" and although some difficulty as to the ownership of the lands to be ceded, at one time seemed likely to arise, the good sense of Wayne and the leading chiefs prevented it, and, the 30th of July, the treaty was agreed to which should bury the hatchet for ever. Between that day and the 3d of August, it was engrossed, and, having been signed by the various nations upon the day last named, it was finally acted upon the 7th, and the presents from"], [89, "niSTORY OF OHIO. 79 the United States distributed. The basis of this treaty was the previous one made at Fort Harmar. The boundaries made at that time were re-affirmed ; the whites were secured on the lands now occu pied by them or secured by former treaties ; and among all the assembled nations, presents, in value not less than one thousand pounds, were distributed to each through its representatives, many thousands in all. The Indians were allowed to remove and punish intruders on their lands, and were permitted to hunt on the ceded lands. \"This great and abiding peace document was signed by the various tribes, and dated August 3, 1795. It was laid before the Senate December 9, and ratified the 22d. So closed the old Indian wars in the West.\" * * Annals of the West.\" CHAPTER VIII. JAY'S TREATY\u2014 THE QUESTION OF STATE RIGHTS AND NATIONAL SUPREMACY\u2014 EXTENSION OF OHIO SETTLEMENTS\u2014 LAND CLAIMS\u2014 SPANISH BOUNDARY QUESTION. WHILE these six years of Indian wars were in progress, Kentucky was admitted as a State, and Pinckney's treaty with Spain was com pleted. This last occurrence was of vital impor tance to the West, as it secured the free navigation of the Mississippi, charging only a fair price for the storage of goods at Spanish ports. This, though not all that the Americans wished, was a great gain in their favor, and did much to stop those agitations regarding a separation on the part of Kentucky. It also quieted affairs further south than Kentucky, in the Georgia and South Carolina Territory, and put an end to French and Spanish intrigue for the Western Territory. The treaty was signed November 24, 1794. Another treaty was concluded by Mr. John Jay between the two governments, Lord Greenville representing the English, and Mr. Jay, the Ameri cans. The negotiations lasted from April to November 19, 1795, when, on that day, the treaty was signed and duly recognized. It decided effectually all the questions at issue, and was the signal for the removal of the British troops from the Northwestern outposts. This was effected as soon as the proper transfers could be made. The second article of the treaty provided that, \" His Majesty will withdraw all his troops and garrisons from all posts and places within the boundary lines assigned by the treaty of peace to the United States. This evacuation shall take place on or before the 1st day of June, 1796, and all the proper measures shall be taken, in the interval, by concert, between the Government of the United States and His Majesty's Governor General in America, for settling the previous arrangements which may be necessary respecting the delivery of the said posts; the United States, in the mean time, at their discretion, extending their settle ments to any part within the said boundary line, except within the precincts or jurisdiction of any of the said posts. \"All settlers and all traders within the precincts or jurisdiction of the said posts shall continue to enjoy, unmolested, all their property of every kind, and shall be protected therein. They shall be at full liberty to remain there or to remove with all, or any part, of their effects, or retain the property thereof at their discretion ; such of them as shall continue to reside within the said boundary lines, shall not be compelled to become citizens of the United States, or take any oath of allegiance to the Government thereof; but they shall be at full liberty so to do, if they think proper; they shall make or declare their election one year after the evacuation aforesaid. And all persons who shall continue therein after the expiration of the said year, without having declared their intention of remaining subjects to His Britannic Majesty, shall be considered as having elected to become citizens of the United States.\" The Indian war had settled all fears from that source ; the treaty with Great Britain had estab lished the boundaries between the two countries and secured peace, and the treaty with Spain had secured the privilege of navigating the Mississippi, by paying only a nominal sum. It had also bound the people of the West together, and ended the old separation question. There was no danger from that now. Another difficulty arose, however, relating to the home rule, and the organization of"], [90, "80 HISTORY OF OHIO. the home government. There were two parties in the country, known as Federalist and Anti-Federal ist. One favored a central government, whose au thority should be supreme ; the other, only a compact, leaving the States supreme. The worth lessness of the old colonial system became, daily, more apparent. While it existed no one felt safe. There was no prospect of paying the debt, and, hence, no credit. When Mr. Hamilton, Secretary of the Treasury, offered his financial plan to the country, favoring centralization, it met, in many places, violent opposition. Washington was strong enough to carry it out, and gave evidence that he would do so. When, therefore, the excise law passed, and taxes on whisky were collected, an open revolt occurred in Pennsylvania, known as the \"Whisky Insurrection. \" It was put down, finally, by military power, and the malcontents made to know that the United States was a gov ernment, not a compact liable to rupture at any time, and by any of its members. It taught the entire nation a lesson. Centralization meant pres ervation. Should a \" compact\" form of government prevail, then anarchy and ruin, and ultimate sub jection to some foreign power, met their view. That they had just fought to dispel, and must it all go for naught? The people saw the rulers were right, and gradually, over the West, spread a spirit antagonistic to State supremacy. It did not revive till Jackson's time, when he, with an iron hand and iron will, crushed out the evil doctrine of State supremacy. It revived again in the late war, again to be crushed. It is to be hoped that ever thus will be its fate. \" The Union is insepa rable,\" said the Government, and the people echoed the words. During the war, and while all these events had been transpiring, settlements had been taking place upon the Ohio, which, in their influence upon the Northwest, and especially upon the State, as soon as it was created, were deeply felt. The Virginia and the Connecticut Reserves were at this time peopled, and, also, that part of the Miami Valley about Dayton, which city dates its origin from that period. As early as 1787, the reserved lands of the Old Dominion north of the Ohio were examined, and, in August of that year, entries were made. As no good title could be obtained from Congress at this time, the settlement practically ceased until 1790, when the prohibition to enter them was withdrawn. As soon as that was done, surveying began again. Nathaniel Massie was among the foremost men in the survey of this tract, and lo cating the lands, laid off a town about twelve miles above Maysville. The place was called Manchester, and yet exists. From this point, Massie continued through all the Indian war, despite the danger, to survey the surrounding country, and prepare it for settlers. Connecticut had, as has been stated, ceded her lands, save a tract extending one hundred and twenty miles beyond the western boundary of Pennsylvania. Of this Connecticut Reserve, so far as the Indian title was extinguished, a survey was ordered in October, 1786, and an office opened for its disposal. Part was soon sold, and, in 1792, half a million of acres were given to those citizens of Connecticut who had lost property by the acts of the Rritish troops during the Revolutionary war at New London, New Haven and elsewhere. These lands thereby became known as \" Fire lands \" and the \"Sufferer's lands,\" and were located in the western part of the Reserve. Tn May, 1795, the Connecticut Legislature authorized a committee to dispose of the remainder of the Reserve. Refore autumn the committee sold it to a company known as the Connecticut Land Company for $1,200,000, and about the 5th of September quitclaimed the land to the Company. The same day the Company received it, it sold 3,000,000 acres to John Mor gan, John Caldwell and Jonathan Rrace, in trust. Upon these quit-claim titles of the land all deeds in the Reserve are based. Surveys were com menced in 1796, and, by the close of the next year, all the land east of the Cuyahoga was divided into townships five miles square. The agent of the Connecticut Land Company was Gen. Moses Cleve land, and in his honor the leading city of the Re serve was named. That township and five others were reserved for private sale; the balance were disposed of by lottery, the first drawing occurring in February, 1798. Dayton resulted from the treaty made by Wayne. It came out of the boundary ascribed to Symmes, and for a while all such lands were not recognized as sold by Congress, owing to the failure of Symmes and his associates in paying for them. Thereby there existed, for a time, considerable un easiness regarding the title to these lands. In 1799, Congress was induced to issue patents to the actual settlers, and thus secure them in their pre emption. Seventeen days after Wayne's treaty, St. Clairs Wilkinson, Jonathan Dayton and Israel Ludlow contracted with Symmes for the seventh and eighth"], [91, "LICKING COUNTY COURT HOUSE."], [92, ""], [93, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 83 ranges, between Mad River and the Little Miami. Three settlements were to be made: one at the mouth of Mad River, one on the Little Miami, in the seventh range, and another on Mad River. On the 21st of September, 1795, Daniel C. Cooper started to survey and mark out a road in the pur chase, and John Dunlap to run its boundaries, which was completed before October 4. On No vember 4, Mr. Ludlow laid off the town of Day ton, which, like land in the Connecticut Reserve, was sold by lottery. A gigantic scheme to purchase eighteen or twenty million acres in Michigan, and then pro cure a good title from the Government \u2014 -who alone had such a right to procure land \u2014 by giving mem bers of Congress an interest in the investment, appeared shortly after Wayne's treaty. When some of the members were approached, however, the real spirit of the scheme appeared, and, instead of gaining ground, led to the exposure, resulting io. the reprimanding severely of Robert Randall, the principal mover in the whole plan, and in its speedy disappearance. Another enterprise, equally gigantic, also ap peared. It was, however, legitimate, and hence successful. On the 20th of February, 1795, the North American Land Company was formed in Philadelphia, under the management of such pat riots as Robert Morris, John Nicholson and James Greenleaf. This Company purchased large tracts in the West, which it disposed of to actual settlers, and thereby aided greatly in populating that part of the country. Refore the close of 1795, the Governor of the Territory, and his Judges, published sixty-four statutes. Thirty-four of these were adopted at Cincinnati during June, July and August of that year. They were known as the Maxwell code, from the name of the publisher, but were passed by Governor St. Clair and Judges Symmes and Turner. Among them was that which provided that the common law of England, and all its stat utes, made previous to the fourth year of James the First, should be in full force within the Terri tory. \"Of the system as a whole,\" says Mr. Case, \"with its many imperfections, it may be doubted that any colony, at so early a period after its first establishment, ever had one so good and applicable to all.\" The Union had now safely passed through its most critical period after the close of the war of independence. The danger from an irruption of its own members ; of a war or alliance of its West- em portion with France and Spain, and many other perplexing questions, were now effectually settled, and the population of the Territory began rapidly to increase. Refore the close of the year 1706, the Northwest contained over five thousand inhabitants, the requisite number to entitle it to one representative in the national Congress. Western Pennsylvania also, despite the various conflicting claims regarding the land titles in that partof the State, began rapidly to fill with emigrants. The \"Triangle\" and the \" Struck District \" were surveyed and put upon the market under the act of 1792. Treaties and purchases from the various Indian tribes, obtained control of the remainder of the lands in that part of the State, and, by 1796, the State owned all the land within its boundaries. Towns were laid off, land put upon the market, so that by the year 1800, the western part of the Keystone State was divided into eight counties, viz., Reaver, Rutler, Mercer, Crawford, Erie, Warren, Venango and Armstrong. The ordinance relative to the survey and dis posal of lands in the Northwest Territory has already been given. It was adhered to, save in minor cases, where necessity required a slight change. The reservations were recognized by Congress, and the titles to them all confirmed to the grantees. Thus, Clarke and his men, the Connecticut Reserve, the Refugee lands, the French inhabitants, and all others holding patents to land from colonial or foreign governments, were all confirmed in their rights and protected in their titles. Refore the close of 1796, the upper North western posts were all vacated by the Rritish, under the terms of Mr. Jay's treaty. Wayne at once transferred his headquarters to Detroit, where a county was named for him, including the north western part of Ohio, the northeast of Indiana, and the whole of Michigan. The occupation of the Territory by the Ameri cans gave additional impulse to emigration, and a better feeling of security to emigrants, who fol lowed closely upon the path of the army. Na thaniel Massie, who has already been noticed as the founder of Manchester, laid out the town of Chillicothe, on the Scioto, in 1796. Refore the close of the year, it contained several stores, shops, a tavern, and was well populated. With the increase of settlement and the security guar anteed by the treaty of Greenville, the arts of civilized life began to appear, and their influence upon pioneers, especially those born on the frontier,"], [94, "S4 HISTORY OF OHIO. began to manifest itself. Retter dwellings, schools, churches, dress and manners prevailed. Life began to assume a reality, and lost much of that recklessness engendered by the habits of a frontier life. Cleveland, Cincinnati, the Miami, the Mus kingum and the Scioto Valleys were filling with people. Cincinnati had more than one hundred log cabins, twelve or fifteen frame houses and a population of more than six hundred persons. Iu 1796, the first house of worship for the Presby terians in that city was built. Refore the close of the same year, Manchester contained over thirty families ; emigrants from Virginia were going up all the valleys from the Ohio; and Ebenezer Zane had opened a bridle path from the Ohio River, at Wheeling, across the country, by Chillicothe, to Limestone, Ky. The next year, the United States mail, for the first time, traversed this route to the West. Zane was given a section of land for his path. The popu lation of the Territory, estimated at from five to eight thousand, was chiefly distributed in lower valleys, bordering on the Ohio River. The French still occupied the Illinois country, and were the principal inhabitants about Detroit. South of the Ohio River, Kentucky was pro gressing favorably, while the \" Southwestern Ter ritory,\" ceded to the United States by North Carolina in 1790, had so rapidly populated that, in 1793, a Territorial form of government was allowed. The ordinance of 17S7, save the clause prohibiting slavery, was adopted, and the Territory named Tennessee. On June 6, 1796, the Terri tory contained more than seventy-five thousand inhabitants, and was admitted into the Union as a State. Four years after, the census showed a population of 105,602 souls, including 13,584 slaves and persons of color. The same year Tennessee became a State, Samuel Jackson and Jonathan Sharpless erected the Redstone Paper Mill, four miles east of Rrownsville, it being the first manufactory of the kind west of the Alle ghanies. In the month of December, 1796, Gen. Wayne, who had done so much for the development of the West, while on his way from Detroit to Philadel phia, was attacked with sickness and died in a cabin near Erie, in the north part of Pennsylvania. He was nearly fifty-one years old, and was one of the bravest officers in the Revolutionary war, and one of America's truest patriots. In 1809, his remains were removed from Erie, by his son, Col. Isaac Wayne, to the Radnor churchyard, near the place of his birth, and an elegant monument erected on his tomb by the Pennsylvania Cincinnati So ciety. After the death of Wayne, Gen. Wilkinson was appointed to the command of the Western army. While he was in command, Carondelet, the Spanish governor of West Florida and Louisiana, made one more effort to separate the Union, and set up either an independent government in the West, or, what was more in accord with his wishes, effect a union with the Spanish nation. In June, 1797, he sent Power again into the Northwest and into Kentucky to sound the existing feeling. Now, however, they were not easily won over. The home government was a certainty, the breaches had been healed, and Power was compelled to abandon the mission , not, however, until he had received a severe reprimand from many who saw through his plan, and openly exposed it. His mission closed the efforts of the Spanish authorities to attempt the dismemberment of the Union, and showed them the coming downfall of their power in Amer ica. They were obliged to surrender the posts claimed by the United States under the treaty of 1795, and not many years after, sold their Amer ican possessions to the United States, rather than see a rival European power attain control over them. On the 7th of April, 1798, Congress passed an act, appointing Winthrop Sargent, Secretary of the Northwest Territory, Governor of the Territory of the Mississippi, formed the same day. In 1801, the boundary between America and the Spanish pos sessions was definitely fixed. The Spanish retired from the disputed territory, and henceforward their attempts to dissolve the American Union ceased. The seat of the Mississippi Territory was fixed at Loftus Heights, six miles north of the thirty-first degree of latitude. The appointment of Sargent to the charge of the Southwest Territory, led to the choice of William Henry Harrison, who had been aid-de-camp to Gen. Wayne in 1794, and whose character stood very high among the people of the West, to the Secretaryship of the Northwest, which place he held until appointed to represent that Territory in Con gress."], [95, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 85 CHAPTER IX.

THE ordinance of 1787 provided that as soon as there were 5,000 persons in the Territory, it was entitled to a representative assembly. On October 29, 1798, Governor St. Clair gave notice by proclamation, that the required population ex isted, and directed that an election be held on the third Monday in December, to choose representa tives. These representatives were required, when assembled, to nominate ten persons, whose names were sent to the President of the United States, who selected five, and with the advice and consent of the Senate, appointed them for the legislative council. In this mode the Northwest passed into the second grade of a Territorial government. The representatives, elected under the proclama tion of St. Clair, met in Cincinnati, January 22, 1799, and under the provisions of the ordinance of 1787, nominated ten persons, whose names were sent to the President. On the 2d of March, he selected from the list of candidates, the names of Jacob Burnet, James Findlay, Henry Vander burgh, Robert Oliver and David Vance. The next day the Senate confirmed their nomination, and the first legislative council of the Northwest Territory was a reality. The Territorial Legislature met again at Cincin nati, September 16, but, for want of a quorum, was not organized until the 24th of that month. The House of Representatives consisted of nine teen members, of whom seven were from Hamilton County, four from Ross \u2014 erected by St. Clair in 1798; three from Wayne \u2014 erected in 1796; two from Adams \u2014 erected in 1797; one from Jeffer son \u2014 erected in 1797; one from Washington \u2014 erected in 1788 ; and one from Knox \u2014 Indiana Territory. None seem to have been present from St. Clair County (Illinois Territory). After the organization of the Legislature, Gov ernor St. Clair addressed the two houses in the Rep resentatives' Chamber, recommending such meas ures as, in his judgment, were suited to the con dition of the country and would advance the safety and prosperity of the people. The Legislature continued in session till the 19th of December, when, having finished their business, they were prorogued by the Governor, by their own request, till the first Monday in November, 1800. This being the first session, there was, of necessity, a great deal of business to do. The transition from a colonial to a semi-independent form of government, called for a general revision as well as a considerable enlargement of the stat ute-book. Some of the adopted laws were re pealed, many others altered and amended, and a long list of new ones added to the code. New offices were to be created and filled, the duties at tached to them prescribed, and a plan of ways and means devised to meet the increased expenditures, occasioned by the change which had now occurred. As Mr. Rurnet was the principal lawyer in the Council, much of the revision, and putting the laws into proper legal form, devolved upon him. He seems to have been well fitted for the place, and to have performed the laborious task in an excel lent manner. \u2666 The whole number of acts passed and approved by the Governor, was thirty-seven. The most im portant related to the militia, the administration of justice, and to taxation. During the session, a bill authorizing a lottery was passed by the council, but rejected by the Legislature, thus interdicting this demoralizing feature of the disposal of lands or for other purposes. The example has always been followed by subsequent legislatures, thus honorably characterizing the Assembly of Ohio, in this re spect, an example Kentucky and several other States might well emulate. Refore the Assembly adjourned, they issued a congratulatory address to the people, enjoining them to \" Inculcate the principles of humanity, benevolence, honesty and punctuality in dealing, sincerity and charity, and all the social affections.\" At the same time, they issued an address to the President, expressing entire confidence in the wis dom and purity of his government, and their warm attachment to the American Constitution."], [96, "8G HISTORY OF OHIO. counties, and his controversy with the Legislature, tended only to strengthen the popular discontent regarding the Governor, who was never fully able to regain the standing he held before his in glorious defeat in his campaign against the Indians. While this was being agitated, another question came into prominence. Ultimately, it settled the powers of the two branches of the government, and caused the removal of St. Clair, then very distasteful to the people. The opening of the present century brought it fully before the people, who began to agitate it in all their assemblies. The great extent of the Territory made the operations of government extremely uncertain, and the power of the courts practically worthless. Its division was, therefore, deemed best, and a committee was appointed by Congress to inquire into the matter. This committee, the 3d of March, 1800, reported upon the subject that, \"In the three western counties, there has been but one court having cognizance of crimes in five years. The immunity which offenders experience, attracts,, as to an asylum, the most vile and aban doned criminals, and, at the same time, deters useful and virtuous citizens from making settle ments in such society. The extreme necessity of judiciary attention and assistance is experienced in civil as well as criminal cases. The supplying to vacant places such necessary officers as may be wanted, such as clerks, recorders and others of like kind, is, from the impossibility of correct notice and information, utterly neglected. This Territory is exposed as a frontier to foreign nations,. whose agents can find sufficient interest in exciting or fomenting insurrection and discontent, as thereby they can more easily divert a valuable trade in furs from the United States, and also have a part thereof on which they border, which feels so little the cherishing hand of their proper gov ernment, or so little dreads its energy, as to render their attachment perfectly uncertain and am biguous. \" The committee would further suggest, that the law of the 3d of March, 1791, granting land to certain persons in the western part of said Ter ritory, and directing the laying-out of the same, remains unexecuted; that great discontent, in consequence of such neglect, is excited in those who are interested in the provisions of said laws, which require the immediate attention of this Legislature. To minister a remedy to these evils, it occurs to this committee, that it is expedient The vote on this address proved, however, that the differences of opinion agitating the Eastern States had penetrated the West. Eleven Representatives voted for it, and five against it. One of the important duties that devolved on this Legislature, was the election of a delegate to Congress. As soon as the Governor's proclama tion made its appearance, the election of a person to fill that position excited general attention. Be fore the meeting of the Legislature public opinion had settled down on William Henry Harrison, and Arthur St. Clair, Jr., who eventually were the only candidates. On the 3d of October, the two houses met and proceeded to a choice. Eleven votes were cast for Harrison, and ten for St. Clair. The Leg islature prescribed the form of a certificate of the election, which was given to Harrison, who at once resigned his office as Secretary of the Territory, proceeded to Philadelphia, and took his seat, Con gress being then in session. \" Though he represented the Territory but one year, \" says Judge Burnett, in his notes, \" he ob tained some important advantages for his constitu ents. He introduced a resolution to sub-divide the surveys of the public lands, and to offer them for sale in smaller tracts ; he succeeded in getting that measure through both houses, in opposition to the interest of speculators, who were, and who wished to be, the retailers of the land to the poorer classes of the community. His proposition be came a law, and was hailed as the most beneficent act that Congress had ever done for the Territory. It put in the power of every industrious man, how ever poor, to become a freeholder, and to lay a foundation for the future support and comfort of his family. At the same session, he obtained a liberal extension of time for the pre-emptioners in the northern part of the Miami purchase, which enabled them to secure their farms, and eventually to become independent, and even wealthy.\" The first session, as has been noticed, closed December 19. Gov. St. Clair took occasion to enumerate in his speech at the close of the session, eleven acts, to which he saw fit to apply his veto. These he had not, however, returned to the Assem bly, and thereby saved a long struggle between the executive and legislative branches of the Territory. Of the eleven acts enumerated, six related to the formation of new counties. These were mainly disproved by St Clair, as he always sturdily main tained that the power to erect new counties was vested alone in the Executive. This free exercise of the veto power, especially in relation to new"], [97, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 87 that a division of said Territory into two distinct and separate governments should be made ; and that such division be made by a line beginning at the mouth of the great Miami River, running directly north until it intersects the boundary between the United States and Canada.\"* The recommendations of the committee were favorably received by Congress, and, the 7th of May, an act was passed dividing the Ter ritory. The main provisions of the act are as follows: \"That, from and after the 4th of July next, all that part of the territory of the United States northwest of the Ohio River, which lies to the westward of a line beginning at the Ohio, opposite to the mouth of the Kentucky River, and running thence to Fort Recovery, and thence north until it intersects the territorial line between the United States and Canada, shall, for the purpose of tem porary government, constitute a separate Territory, and be called the Indiana Territory. \"There shall be established within the said Ter ritory a government, in all respects similar to that provided by the ordinance of Congress passed July 13, 1797.\" f The act further provided for representatives, and for the establishment of an assembly, on the same plan as that in force in the Northwest, stipulating that until the number of inhabitants reached five thousand, the whole number of representatives to the General Assembly should not be less than seven, nor more than nine ; apportioned by the Governor among the several counties in the new Terri tory. The act further provided that \" nothing in the act should be so construed, so as in any manner to affect the government now in force in the terri tory of the United States northwest of the Ohio River, further than to prohibit the exercise thereof within the Indiana Territory, from and after the aforesaid 4th of July next. \" Whenever that part of the territory of the United States, which lies to the eastward of a line beginning at the mouth of the Great Miami River, and running thence due north to the territorial line between the United States and Canada, shall be erected into an independent State, and admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the orig inal States ; thenceforth said line shall become and remain permanently, the boundary line between such State and the Indiana Territory.\" * American State Papers. fLand Laws. It was further enacted, \" that, until it shall be otherwise enacted by the legislatures of the said territories, respectively, Chillicothe, on the Scioto River, shall be the seat of government of the ter ritory of the United States northwest of the Ohio River ; and that St. Vincent's, on the Wabash River, shall be the seat of government for the Indiana Territory.\" * St. Clair was continued as Governor of the old Territory, and William Henry Harrison appointed Governor of the new. Connecticut, in ceding her territory in the West to the General Government, reserved a portion, known as the Connecticut Reserve. When she afterward disposed of her claim in the manner narrated, the citizens found themselves without any government on which to lean for support. At that time, settlements had begun in thirty-five of the townships into which the Reserve had been divided ; one thousand persons had established homes there ; mills had been built, and over seven hundred miles of roads opened. In 1800, the settlers petitioned for acceptance into the Union, as a part of the Northwest ; and, the mother State releasing her judi ciary claims, Congress accepted the trust, and granted the request. In December, of that year, the population had so increased that the county of Trumbull was erected, including the Reserve. Soon after, a large number of settlers came from Pennsylvania, from which State they had been driven by the dispute concerning land titles in its western part. Unwilling to cultivate land to which they could only get a doubtful deed, they abandoned it, and came where the titles were sure. Congress having made Chillicothe the capital of the Northwest Territory, as it now existed, on the 3d of November the General Assembly met at that place. Gov. St. Clair had been made to feel the odium cast upon his previous acts, and, at the open ing of this session, expressed, in strong terms, his disapprobation of the censure cast upon him. He had endeavored to do his duty in all cases, he said, and yet held the confidence of the President and Congress. He still held the office, notwithstanding the strong dislike against him. At the second session of the Assembly, at Chil licothe, held in the autumn of 1801, so much out spoken enmity was expressed, and so much abuse heaped upon the Governor and the Assembly, that a law was passed, removing the capital to Cincinnati * Land Laws."], [98, "88 HISTORY OF OHIO. again. It was not destined, however, that the Territorial Assembly should meet again anywhere. The unpopularity of the Governor caused many to long for a State government, where they could choose their own rulers. The unpopularity of St. Clair arose partly from the feeling connected with his defeat ; in part from his being connected with the Federal party, fast falling into disrepute; and, in part, from his assuming powers which most thought he had no right to exercise, especially the power of subdividing the counties of the Terri tory. The opposition, though powerful out of the Assembly, was in the minority there. During the month of December, 1801, it was forced to protest against a measure brought forward in the Council, for changing the ordinance of 1787 in such a man ner as to make the Scioto, and a line drawn from the intersection of that river and the Indian boundary to the western extremity of the Reserve, the limits of the most eastern State, to be formed from the Territory. Had this change been made, the formation of a State government beyond the Ohio would have been long delayed. Against it, RepresentativesWorthington,Langham, Darlington, Massie, Dunlavy and Morrow, recorded their pro test. Not content with this, they sent Thomas Worthington, who obtained a leave of absence, to the seat of government, on behalf of the objectors, there to protest, before Congress, against the pro posed boundary. While Worthington was on his way, Massie presented, the 4th of January, 1802, a resolution for choosing a committee to address Congress in respect to the proposed State govern ment. This, the next day, the House refused to do, by a vote of twelve to five. An attempt was next made to procure a census of the Ter ritory, and an act for that purpose passed the House, but the Council postponed the considera tion of it until the next session, which would com mence at Cincinnati, the fourth Monday of No vember. ' Meanwhile, Worthington pursued the ends of his mission, using his influence to effect that organ ization, \"which, terminating the influence of tyr anny,\" was.to \"meliorate the circumstances of thou sands, by freeing them from the domination of a despotic chief.\" His efforts were successful, and, the 4th of March, a report was made to the House in favor of authorizing a State convention. This report was based on the assumption that there were now over sixty thousand inhabitants in the proposed boundaries, estimating that emigration had increased the census of 1800, which gave the Ter ritory forty-five thousand inhabitants, to that num ber. The convention was to ascertain whether it were expedient to form such a government, and to prepare a constitution if such organization were deemed best. In the formation of the State, a change in the boundaries was proposed, by which all the territory north of a line drawn due east from the head of Lake Michigan to Lake Erie was to be excluded from the new government about to be called into existence. The committee appointed by Congress to report upon the feasibility of forming the State, suggested that Congress reserve out of every township sections numbered 8, 11, 26 and 29, for their own use, and that Section 16 be reserved for the maintenance of schools. The committee also suggested, that, \"religion, education and morality being necessary to the good government and happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall be forever encouraged.\" Various other recommendations were given by the committee, in accordance with which, Congress, April 30, passed the resolution authorizing the calling of a convention. As this accorded with the feelings of the majority of the inhabitants of the Northwest, no opposition was experienced ; even the Legislature giving way to this embryo gov ernment, and failing to assemble according to ad journment. The convention met the 1st of November. Its members were generally Jeffersonian in their na tional politics, and had been opposed to the change of boundaries proposed the year before. Before proceeding to business, Gov. St. Clair proposed to address them in his official character. This propo sition was resisted by several of the members; but, after a motion, it was agreed to allow him to speak to them as a citizen. St. Clair did so, advising the postponement of a State government until the people of the original eastern division were plainly entitled to demand it, and were not subject to be bound by conditions. This advice, given as it was,. caused Jefferson instantly to remove St. Clair, at which time his office ceased.* \"When the vote was taken,\" says Judge Burnet, \"upon doing what * After this, St. Clair returned to his old home in the Ligonier Valley, Pennsylvania, where he lived with his children in almost abject poverty. He had lost money in his public life, as he gave closeattention to public affairs, to the detriment of his own business. He presented a claim to Congress, afterward, for supplies funii-lied to the army, but the claim was outlawed. After trying in vain to get the claim allowed, he returned to his home. Pennsylvania, learning of his distress, granted him an annuity of $350, afterward raised to 8600. He lived to enjoy this but a short time, his death occurring August 31, 1818. He was eighty-four years of age."], [99, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 89 he advised them not to do, but one of thirty-three (Ephraim Cutler, of Washington County) voted with the Governor.\" On one point only were the proposed boundaries of the new State altered. \" To every person who has attended to this sub ject, and who has consulted the maps of the West ern country extant at the time the ordinance of 1787 was passed, Lake Michigan was believed to be, and was represented by all the maps of that day as being, very far north of the position which it has since been ascertaiaed to occupy. I have seen the map in the Department of State which was before the committee of Congress who framed and reported the ordinance for the government of the Territory. On that map, the southern bound ary of Michigan was represented as being above the forty-second degree of north latitude. And there was a pencil line, said to have been made by the committee, passing through the southern bend of the lake to the Canada line, which struck the strait not far below the town of Detroit. The line was manifestly intended by the committee and by Congress to be the northern boundary of our State; and, on the principles by which courts of chancery construe contracts, accompanied by plats, it would seem that the map, and the line referred to, should be conclusive evidence of our boundary, without reference to the real position of the lakes. \"When the convention sat, in 1802, the under derstanding was, that the old maps were nearly correct, and that the line, as defined in the ordi nance, would terminate at some point on the strait above the Mauniee Ray. While the convention was in session, a man who had hunted many years on Lake Michigan, and was well acquainted with its position, happened to be in Chillicothe, and, in conversation with one of the members, told him that the lake extended much farther south than was generally supposed, and that a map of the country which he had seen, placed its southern bend many miles north of its true position. This information excited some uneasiness, and induced the convention to modify the clause describing the north boundary of the new State, so as to guard against its being depressed below the most north ern cape of the Maumee Ray.\"* With this change and some extension of the school and road donations, the convention agreed to the proposal of Congress, and, November 29, * Historical Transactions of Ohio. \u2014 Judge Burnett. their agreement was ratified and signed, as was also the constitution of the State of Ohio \u2014 so named from its river, called by the Shawanees Ohio, meaning beautiful \u2014 forming its southern bound ary. Of this nothing need be said, save that it bore the marks of true democratic feeling \u2014 -of full faith in the people. By them, however, it was never voted for. It stood firm until 1852, when it was superseded by the present one, made neces sary by the advance of time. The General Assembly was required to meet at Chillicothe, the first Tuesday of March, 1803. This change left the territory northwest of the Ohio River, not included in the new State, in the Territories of Indiana and Michigan. Subse quently, in 1816, Indiana was made a State, and confined to her present limits. Illinois was made a Territory then, including Wisconsin. In 1818, it became a State, and Wisconsin a Territory at tached to Michigan. This latter was made a State in 1837, and Wisconsin a separate Territory, which, in 1847, was made a State. Minnesota was made a Territory the same year, and a State in 1857, and the five contemplated States of the territory were complete. Preceding pages have shown how the territory north of the Ohio River was peopled by the French and English, and how it came under the rule of the American people. The war ef the Revolution closed in 1783, and left all America jn the hands of a new nation. That nation brought a change. Before the war, various attempts had been made by residents in New England to people the country west of the Alleghanies. Land com panies were formed, principal among which were the Ohio Company, and the company of which John Cleves Symmes was the agent and chief owner. Large tracts of land on the Scioto and on the Ohio were entered. The Ohio Company were the first to make a settlement. It was or ganized in the autumn of 1787, November 27. They made arrangements for a party of forty -seven men to set out for the West under the supervision of Gen. Rufus Putnam, Superintendent of the Com pany. Early in the winter they advanced to the Youghiogheny River, and there built a strong boat, which they named \" Maj'flower.\" It was built by Capt. Jonathan Devol, the first ship-builder in the West, and, when completed, was placed under his command. The boat was launched April 2, 1788, and the band of pioneers, like the Pilgrim Fathers, began their voyage. The 7th of the month, they arrived at the mouth of the Muskingum,"], [100, "90 HISTORY OF OHIO. their destination, opposite Fort Harmar,* erected in the autumn of 1785, by a detachment of United States troops, under command of Maj. John Doughty, and, at the date of the Mayflower's arrival in possession of a company of soldiers. Under the protection of these troops, the little band of men began their labor of laying out a town, and commenced to erect houses for their own and subsequent emigrants' occupation. The names of these pioneers of Ohio, as far as can now be learned, are as follows: Gen. Putnam, Return Jonathan Meigs, Win throp Sargeant ( Secretary of the Territory), Judges Parsons and Varnum, Capt. Dana, Capt. Jonathan Devol, Joseph Rarker, Col. Rattelle, Maj. Tyler, Dr. True, Capt. Wm. Gray, Capt. Lunt, the Rridges, Ebenezer and Thomas Cory, Andrew Mc- Clure, Wm. Mason, Thomas Lord, Wm. Gridley, Gilbert Devol, Moody Russels, Deavens, Oakes, Wright, Clough, Green, Shipman, Dorance, the Masons, and others, whose names are now be yond recall. On the 19th of July, the first boat of families arrived, after a nine-weeks journey on the way. They had traveled in their wagons as far as Wheel ing, where they built large flat-boats, into which they loaded their effects, including their cattle, and thence passed down the Ohio to their destination. The .families were those of Gen. Tupper, Col. Ichabod Nye, Col. Cushing, Maj. Coburn, and Maj.Goodale. In these titles the reader will ob serve the preponderance of military distinction. Many of the founders of the colony had served with much valor in the war for freedom, and were well prepared for a life in the wilderness. They began at once the construction of houses from the forests about the confluence of the rivers, guarding their stock by day and penning it by night. Wolves, bears and Indians were all about them, and, here in the remote wilderness, they were obliged to always be on their guard. From the ground where they obtained the timber to erect their houses, they soon produced a few vegetables, and when the families arrived in August, they were able to set before them food raised for the * The outlines of Fort Harmar formed a regular pentagon, embracing within the area about three-fourths of an acre. Its walls were formed of large horizontal timbers, and the bastions of large upright timbersabout fourteen feet in height, fastened to each other by strips of timber, tree-nailed into each picket. In the rear of the fortMuj. Doughty laid out fine gardens. It continued to be occupied by United States troops until September 1790, when they were ordered to Cincinnati. A company, under Capt. Haskell, continued to make the fort their headquarters during the Indian war, occasionally assisting the colonists at Marietta, Belpre and Waterford against the Indians. When not needed by the troops, the fort was used by the people of Marietta. first time by the hand of American citizens in the Ohio Valley. One of those who came in August, was Mr. Thomas Guthrie, a settler in one of the western counties of Pennsylvania, who brought a bushel of wheat, which he sowed on a plat of ground cleared by himself, and from which that fall he procured a small crop of wheat, the first grown in the State of Ohio. The Marietta settlement was the only one made that summer in the Territory. From their arrival until October, when Governor St. Clair came, they were busily employed making houses, and prepar- ing for the winter. The little colony, of which Washington wrote so favorably, met on the 2d day of July,\" to name their newborn city and its pub- lic sqares. Until now it had been known as \" The Muskingum\" simply, but on that day the name Marietta was formally given to it, in honor of Ma- rie Antoinette. The 4th of July, an ovation was held, and an oration delivered by James M. Var- num, who, with S. H. Parsons and John Arm- strong, had been appointed Judges of the Terri- tory. Thus, in the heart of the wilderness, miles away from any kindred post, in the forests of the Great West, was the Tree of Liberty watered and given a hearty growth. On the morning of the 9th of July, Governor St. Clair arrived, and the colony began to assume form. The ordinance of 1787 had provided for a form of government under the Governor and the three Judges, and this form was at once put into force. The 25th, the first law relating to the militia was published, and the next day the Gov- ernor's proclamation appeared, creating all the country that had been ceded by the Indians, east of the Scioto River, into the county of Washing- ton, and the civil machinery was in motion. From that time forward, this, the pioneer settlement in Ohio, went on prosperously. The 2d of Septem- ber, the first court in the Territory was held, but as it related to the Territory, a narrative of its pro- ceedings will be found in the history of that part of the country, and need not be repeated here. The 15th of July, Gov. St. Clair had published the ordinance of 1787, and the commissions of himself and the three Judges. He also assembled the people of the settlement, and explained to them the ordinance in a speech of considerable length. Three days after, he sent a notice to the Judges, calling their attention to the subject of organizing the militia. Instead of attending to this important matter, and thus providing for their safety should trouble with the Indians arise, the"], [101, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 91 Judges did not even reply to the Governor's letter, but sent him what they called a \"project\" of a law for dividing real estate. The bill was so loosely drawn that St. Clair immediately rejected it, and set about organizing the militia himself. He divided the militia into two classes, \"Senior\" and \"Junior,\" and organized them by appointing their officers. In the Senior Class, Nathan Cushing was ap pointed Captain; George Ingersol, Lieutenant, and James Backus, Ensign. In the Junior Class, Nathan Goodale and Charles Knowls were made Captains ; Watson Casey and Samuel Stebbins, Lieutenants, and Joseph Lincoln and Arnold Colt, Ensigns. The Governor next erected the Courts of Pro bate and Quarter Sessions, and proceeded to ap point civil officers. Rufus Putnam, Renjamin Tupper and Winthrop Sargeant were made Jus tices of the Peace. The 30th of August, the day the Court of Quarter Sessions was appointed, Archibald Cary, Isaac Pierce and Thomas Lord were also appointed Justices, and given power to hold this court. They were, in fact, Judges of a Court of Common Pleas. Return Jonathan Meigs was appointed Clerk of this Court of Quarter Sessions. Ebenezer Sproa t was appointed Sheriff of Washington County, and also Colonel of the militia; William Callis, Clerk of the Supreme Court; Rufus Putnam, Judge of the Probate Court, and R. J. Meigs, Jr., Clerk. Following these appoint ments, setting the machinery of government in motion, St. Clair ordered that the 25th of Decem ber be kept as a day of thanksgiving by the infant colony for its safe and propitious beginning. During the fall and winter, the settlement was daily increased by emigrants, so much so, that the greatest difficulty was experienced in finding them lodging. During the coldest part of the winter, when ice covered the river, and prevented navi gation, a delay in arrivals was experienced, only to be broken as soon as the river opened to the beams of a spring sun. While locked in the winter's embrace, the colonists amused themselves in vari ous ways, dancing being one of the most promi nent. At Christmas, a grand ball was held, at which there were fifteen ladies, \"whose grace,\" says a narrator, \"equaled any in the East.\" Though isolated in the wilderness, they knew a brilliant prospect lay before them, and lived on in a joyous hope for the future. Soon after their arrival, the settlers began the erection of a stockade fort (Campus Martius), which occupied their time until the winter of 1791. During the interval, fortunately, no hos tilities from the Indians were experienced, though they were abundant, and were frequent visitors to the settlement. From a communication in the American Pioneer, by Dr. S. P. Hildreth, the following description of Campus Martius is derived. As it will apply, in a measure, to many early structures for defense in the West, it is given entire : \" The fort was made in the form of a regular parallelogram, the sides of each being 180 feet. At each corner was erected a strong block-house, surmounted by a tower, and a sentry box. These houses were twenty feet square below and twenty four feet square above, and projected six feet be yond the walls of the fort. The intermediate walls were made up with dwelling-houses, made of wood, whose ends were whip-sawed into timbers four inches thick, and of the requisite width and length. These were laid up similar to the structure of log houses, with the ends nicely dove-tailed together. The whole were two stories high, and covered with shingle roofs. Convenient chimneys were erected of bricks, for cooking, and warming' the rooms. A number of the dwellings were built and owned by individuals who had families. In the west and south fronts were strong gateways ; and over the one in the center of the front looking to the.Mus kingum River, was a belfry. The chamber beneath was occupied by Winthrop Sargeant, as an office, he being Secretary to the Governor, and perform ing the duties of the office during St. Clair's ab sence. This room projected over the gateway, like a block-house, and was intended for the protection of the gate beneath, in time of an assault. At the outer corner of each block-house was erected a bastion, standing on four stout timbers. The floor of the bastipn was a little above the lower story of the block-house. They were square, and built up to the height of a man's head, so that, when he looked over, he stepped on a narrow platform or \" banquet \" running around the sides of the bulwark. Port-holes were made, for musketry as well as for artillery, a single piece of which was mounted in the southwest and northeast bastions. In these, the sentries were regularly posted every night, as more convenient than the towers ; a door leading into them from the upper story of the block-houses. The lower room of the southwest block-house was occupied as a guard-house. \" Running from corner to corner of the block houses was a row of palisades, sloping outward,"], [102, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 92 and his Secretary, with the officers of the Com pany. \" Opposite the fort, on the shore of the river, was built a substantial timber wharf, at which was moored a fine cedar barge for twelve rowers, built by Capt. Jonathan Devol, for Gen. Putnam ; a number of pirogues, and the light canoes of the country ; and last, not least, the Mayflower, or ' Adventure Galley,' in which the first detach ments of colonists were transported from the shores of the ' Yohiogany ' to the banks of the Muskingum. In these, especially the canoes, during the war, most of the communications were carried on between the settlements of the Company and the more re mote towns above on the Ohio River. Traveling by land was very hazardous to any but the rangers or spies. There were no roads, nor bridges across the creeks, and, for many years after the war had ceased, the traveling was nearly all done by canoes on the river.\" Thus the first settlement of Ohio provided for its safety and comfort, and provided also for that of emigrants who came to share the toils of the wilderness. The next spring, the influx of emigration was so great that other settlements were determined, and hence arose the colonies of Relpre, Waterford and Duck Creek, where they began to clear land, sow and plant crops, and build houses and stockades. At Relpre (French for \"beautiful meadow\"), were built three stockades, the upper, lower and middle, the last of which was called \" Farmers' Castle,\" and stood on the banks of the Ohio, nearly oppo site an island, afterward famous in Western history as Rlennerhasset's Island, the scene of Rurr's con spiracy. Among the persons settling at the upper stockade, were Capts. Dana and Stone, Col. Rent, William Rrowning, Judge Foster, John Rowse, Israel Stone and a Mr. Keppel. At the Farmers' Castle, were Cols. Cushing and Fisher, Maj. Has kell, Aaron Waldo Putnam, Mr. Sparhawk, and, it is believed, George and Israel Putnam, Jr. At the lower, were Maj. Goodale, Col. Rice, Esquire Pierce, Judge Israel Loring, Deacon Miles, Maj. Rradford and Mr. Goodenow. In the summer of 1789, Col. Ichabod Nye and some others, built a block-house at Newberry, below Relpre. Col. Nye sold his lot there to Aaron W. Clough, who, with Stephen Guthrie, Joseph Leavins, Joel Oakes, Eleazer Curtis, Mr. Denham J. Littleton and Mr. Rrown, was located at that place. \"Every exertion possible,\" says Dr. Hildreth, who has preserved the above names and incidents, and resting on stout rails. Twenty feet in advance of these, was a row of very strong and large pick ets, set upright in the earth. Gateways through these, admitted the inmates of the garrison. A few feet beyond the row of outer palisades was placed a row of abattis, made from the tops and branches of trees, sharpened and pointing outward, so that it would have been very difficult for an enemy to have penetrated within their outworks. The dwelling-houses occupied a space from fifteen to thirty feet each, and were sufficient for the ac commodation of forty or fifty families, and did actually contain from two hundred to three hun dred persons during the Indian war. \"Refore the Indians commenced hostilities, the block-houses were occupied as follows : The south west one, by the family of Gov. St. Clair; the northeast one as an office for the Directors of the Company. The area within the walls was one hundred and forty-four feet square, and afforded a fine parade ground. In the center, was a well eighty feet in depth, for the supply of water to the inhabitants, in case of a siege. A large sun-dial stood for many years in the square, placed on a handsome post, and gave note of the march of time. \" After the war commenced, a regular military corps was organized, and a guard constantly kept night and day. The whole establishment formed a very strong work, and reflected great credit on the head that planned it. It was in a manner im pregnable to the attacks of Indians, and none but a regular army with cannon could have reduced it. The Indians possessed no such an armament. \" The garrison stood on the verge of that beauti ful plain overlooking the Muskingum, on which are seated those celebrated remains of antiquity, erected probably for a similar purpose \u2014 the defense of the inhabitants. The ground descends into shal low ravines on the north and south sides ; on the west is an abrupt descent to the river bottoms or alluvium, and the east passed out to a level plain. On this, the ground was cleared of trees beyond the reach of rifle shots, so as to afford no shelter to a hidden foe. Extensive fields of corn were grown in the midst of the standing girdled trees be yond, in after years. The front wall of palisades was about one hundred and fifty yards from the Muskingum River. The appearance of the fort from without was imposing, at a little distance re sembling the military castles of the feudal ages. Retween the outer palisades and the river were laid out neat gardens for the use of Gov. St. Clair"], [103, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 93 \"for men in these circumstances, was made to se cure food for future difficulties. Col. Oliver, Maj. Hatfield White and John Dodge, of the Water ford settlement, began mills on Wolf Creek, about three miles from the fort, and got them running; and these, the first mills in Ohio, were never de stroyed during the subsequent Indian war, though the proprietors removed their familes to the fort at Marietta. Col. E. Sproat and Enoch Shep herd began mills on Duck Creek, three miles from Marietta, from-the completion of which they were driven by the Indian war. Thomas Stanley be gan mills farther up, near the Duck Creek settle ment. These were likewise unfinished. The Ohio Company built a large horse mill near Campus Martius, and soon after a floatiug mill.\" The autumn before the settlements at Belpre, Duck Creek and Waterford, were made, a colony was planted near the mouth of the Little Miami River, on a tract of ten thousand acres, purchased from Symmes by Maj. Benjamin Stites. In the pre ceding pages may be found a history of Symmes' purchase. This colony may be counted the second settlement in the State. Soon after the colony at Marietta was founded, steps were taken to occupy separate portions of Judge Symmes' purchase, be tween the Miami Rivers. Three parties were formed for this purpose, but, owing to various delays, chiefly in getting the present colony stead fast and safe from future encroachments by the savages, they did not get started till late in the fall. The first of these parties, consisting of fifteen or twenty men, led by Maj. Stites, landed at the mouth of the Little Miami in November, 17S8, and, constructing a log fort, began to lay out a village, called by them Columbia. It soon grew into prominence, and, before winter had thoroughly set in, they were well prepared for a frontier life. In the party were Cols. Spencer and Brown, Majs. Gano and Kibbey, Judges Goforth and Foster, Rev. John Smith, Francis Dunlavy, Capt. Flinn, Jacob White, John Riley, and Mr. Hubbell. All these were men of energy and enterprise, and, with their comrades, were more numerous than either of the other parties, who commenced their settlements below them on the Ohio. This village was also, at first, more flourishing; and, for two or three years, contained more inhabitants than any other in the Miatui purchase. The second Miami party was formed at Lime stone, under Matthias Denham and Robert Pat terson, and consisted of twelve or fifteen persons. They landed on the north bank of the Ohio, oppo- site the mouth of the Licking River, the 24th of December, 1788. They intended to establish a station and lay out a town on a plan prepared at Limestone. Some statements affirm that the town was to be called \" L-os-anti-villt,'' by a romantic school-teacher named Filson. However, be this as it may, Mr. Filson was, unfortunately for himself, not long after, slain by the Indians, and, with him probably, the name disajjpeared. He was to have one-third interest in the proposed city, which, when his death occurred, was transferred to Israel Ludlow, and a new plan of a city adopted. Israel Ludlow surveyed the proposed town, whose lots were principally donated to settlers upon certain condi tions as to settlement and improvement, and the embryo city named Cincinnati. Gov. St. Clair very likely had something to do with the naming of the village, and, by some, it is asserted that he changed the name from Losantiville to Cincinnati, when he created the county of Hamilton the en suing winter. The original purchase of the city's site was made by Mr. Dcnham. It included about eight hundred acres, for which he paid 5 shillings per acre in Continental certificates, then worth, in specie, about 5 shillings per pound,, gross weight. Evidently, the original site was a good investment, could Mr. Denham have lived long enough to see its present condition. The third party of settlers for the Miami pur chase, were under the care of Judge Symmes, himself. They left Limestone, January 29, 17S9, and were much delayed on their downward jour ney by the ice in the river. They reached the \" Rend,\" as it was then known, early in February. The Judge had intended to found a city here, which, in time, would be the rival of the Atlantic cities. As each of the three settlements aspired to the same position, no little rivalry soon mani fested itself. The Judge named his proposed city North Rend, from the fact that it was the most northern bend in the Ohio below the mouth of the Great Kanawha. These three settlements ante dated, a few months, those made near Marietta, already described. They arose so soon after, partly from the extreme desire of Judge Symmes to settle his purchase, and induce emigration here instead of on the Ohio Company's purchase. The Judge labored earnestly for this purpose and to further secure him in his title to the land he had acquired, all of which he had so far been unable to retain, owins to his inability to meet his payments. All these emigrants came down the river in the flat -boats of the day, rude affairs, sometimes called"], [104, "91 HISTORY OF OHIO. \" Arks,\" and then the only safe mode of travel in the West. Judge Symmes found he must provide for the safety of the settlers on his purchase, and, after earnestly soliciting Gen. Harmar, commander of the Western posts, succeeded in obtaining a de tachment of forty-eight men, under Capt. Kearsey, to protect the improvements just commencing on the Miami. This detachment reached Limestone in December, 1788. Part was at once sent for ward to guard Maj. Stites and his pioneers. Judge Symmes and his party started in January, and, about February 2, reached Columbia, where the Captain expected to find a fort erected for his use and shelter. The flood on the river, however, de feated his purpose, and, as he was unprepared to erect another, he determined to go on down to the garrison at the falls at Louisville. Judge Symmes was strenuously opposed to his conduct, as it lest the colonies unguarded, but, all to no purpose ; the Captain and his command, went to Louisville early in March, and left the Judge and his settlement to protect themselves. Judge Symmes immedi ately sent a strong letter to Maj. Willis, command ing at the Falls, complaining of the conduct of Capt. Kearsey, representing the exposed situ ation of the Miami settlements, stating the indi cations of hostility manifested by the Indians, and requesting a guard to be sent to the Rend. This request was at once granted, and Ensign Luce, with seventeen or eighteen soldiers, sent. They were at the settlement but a short time, when they were attacked by Indians, and one of their number killed, and four or five wounded. They repulsed the savages and saved the set tlers. The site of Symmes City, for such he designed it should ultimately be called, was above the reach of water, and sufficiently level to admit of a conven ient settlement. The city laid out by Symmes was truly magnificent on paper, and promised in the future to fulfill his most ardent hopes. The plat included the village, and extended across the peninsula between the Ohio and Miami Rivers. Each settler on this plat was promised a lot if he would improve it, and in conformity to the stipu lation, Judge Symmes soon found a large number of persons applying for residence. As the number of these adventurers increased, in consequence of this provision and the protection of the military, the Judge was induced to lay out another village six or seven miles up the river, which he called South Rend, where he disposed of some donation lots, but the project foiling, the village site was de- serted, and converted into a form. During all the time these various events were transpiring, but little trouble was experienced with the Indians. They were not yet disposed to evince hostile feelings. This would have been their time, .but, not realizing the true intent of the whites until it was too late to conquer them, they allowed them to become prepared to withstand a warfare, and in the end were obliged to suffer their hunting-grounds to be taken from them, and made the homes of a race destined to entirely supersede them in the New World. Ry the means sketched in the foregoing pages, were the three settlements on the Miami made. Ry the time those adjacent to Marietta were well estab- lished, these were firmly fixed, each one striving to become the rival city all felt sure was to arise. For a time it was a matter of doubt which of the rivals, Columbia, North Rend or Cincinnati, would event- ually become the chief seat of business. In the beginning, Columbia, the eldest of the three, took the lead, both in number of its in- habitants and the convenience and appearance of its dwellings. For a time it was a flourishing place, and many believed it would become the great busi- ness town of the Miami country. That apparent fact, however, lasted but a short time. The garri- son was moved to Cincinnati, Fort Washington built there, and in spite of all that Maj. Stites, or Judge Symmes could do, that place became the metropolis. Fort Washington, the most extensive garrison in the West, was built by Maj. Doughty, in the summer of 1789, and from that time the growth and future greatness of Cincinnati were assured. The first house in the city was built on Front street, east of and near Main street. It was simply a strong log cabin, and was erected of the forest trees cleared away from the ground on which it stood. The lower part of the town was covered with sycamore and maple trees, and the upper with beech and oak. Through this dense forest the streets were laid out, and their corners marked on the trees. The settlements on the Miami had become sufficiently numerous to warrant a separate county, and, in January, 1790, Gov. St. Clair and his Secretary arrived in Cincinnati, and organized the county of Hamilton, so named in honor of the illustrious statesman by that name. It included all the country north of the Ohio, between the Miamis, as far as a line running \" due east from the"], [105, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 95 Standing Stone forks \" of Rig Miami to its inter section with the Little Miami. The erection of the new county, and the appointment of Cincin nati to be the seat of justice, gave the town a fresh impulse, and aided greatly in its growth. Through the summer, but little interruption in the growth of the settlements occurred. The Indians had permitted the erection of defensive works in their midst, and could not now destroy them. They were also engaged in traffic with the whites, and, though they evinced signs of discon tent at their settlement and occupation of the country, yet did not openly attack them. The truth was, they saw plainly the whites were always prepared, and no opportunity was given them to plunder and destroy. The Indian would not attack unless success was almost sure. An oppor tunity, unfortunately, came, and with it the hor rors of an Indian war. In the autumn of 1790, a company of thirty six men went from Marietta to a place on the Muskingum known as the Ria; Rottom. Here they built a block-house, on the east bank of the river, four miles above the mouth of Meigs Creek. They were chiefly young, single men, but little acquainted with Indian warfare or military rules. The savages had given signs that an attack on the settlement was meditated, and several of the know ing ones at the strongholds strenuously opposed any new settlements that fall, advising their post ponement until the next spring, when the question of peace or war would probably be settled. \u25a0 JSven Gen. Putnam and the Directors of the Ohio Com pany advised the postponement of the settlement until the next spring. The young men were impatient and restless, and declared themselves able to protect their fort against any number of assailants. They might have easily done so, had they taken the necessary precautions ; but, after they had erected a rude block-house of unchinked logs, they began to pass the time in various pursuits ; setting no guard, and taking no precautionary measures, they left them selves an easy prey to any hostile savages that might choose to come and attack them. About twenty rods from the block-house, and a little back from the bank of the river, two men, Francis and Isaac Choate, members of the com pany, had erected a cabin, and commenced clearing lots. Thomas Shaw, a hired laborer, and James Patten, another of the associates, lived with them. About the same distance below the block-house was an old \"Tomahawk Improvement\" and a small cabin, which two men, Asa and Eleazur Rullard, had fitted up and occupied. The Indian war-path, from Sandusky to the mouth of the Muskingum, passed along the opposite shore of the river. \" The Indians, who, during the summer,\" says Dr. Hildreth, \" had been hunting and loitering about the Wolf Creek and Plainfield settlements, holding frequent and friendly intercourse with the settlers, selling them venison and bear's meat in ex change for green corn and vegetables, had with drawn and gone up the river, early in the au tumn, to their towns, preparatory to going into winter quarters. They very seldom entered on any warlike expeditions during the cold weather. Rut they had watched the gradual encroach ment of the whites and planned an expedition against them. They saw them in fancied security in their cabins, and thought their capture an easy task. It is said they were not aware of the Rig Rottom settlement until they came in sight of it, on the opposite shore of the river, in the afternoon. From a high hill opposite the garrison, they had a view of all that part of the bottom, and could see how the men were occupied and what was doing about the block-house. It was not protected with palisades or pickets, and none of the men were aware or prepared for an attack. Having laid their plans, about twilight they crossed the river above the garrison, on the ice, and divided their men into two parties \u2014 the larger one to attack the block-house, the smaller one to capture the cabins. As the Indians cautiously approached the cabin they found the inmates at supper. Part entered, addressed the whites in a friendly manner, but soon manifesting their designs, made them all pris oners, tieing them with leather thongs they found in the cabin.\" At the block-house the attack was far different. A stout Mohawk suddenly burst open the door, the first intimation the inmates had of the pres ence of the foe, and while he held it open his comrades shot down those that were within. Rush ing in, the deadly tomahawk completed the on slaught. In the assault, one of the savages was struck by the wife of Isaac Woods, with an ax, but only slightly injured. The heroic woman was immediately slain. All the men but two were slain before they had time to secure their arms, thereby paying for their failure to properly secure themselves, with their lives. The two excepted were John Stacy and his brother Philip, a lad six teen years of age. John escaped to the roof,"], [106, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 96 for the impending crisis all felt sure must come. Either the Indians must go, or the whites must retreat. A few hardy and adventurous persons ventured out into the woods and made settle ments, but even these were at the imminent risk of, their lives, many of them perishing in the attempt. The Indian war that followed is given fully in preceding pages. It may be briefly sketched by stating that the first campaign, under Gen Har mar, ended in the defeat of his army at the Indian villages on the Miami of the lake, and the rapid retreat to Fort Washington. St. Clair was next commissioned to lead an army of nearly three thou sand men, but these were furiously attacked at break of day, on the morning of November 4, 1791, and utterly defeated. Indian outrages sprung out anew after each defeat, and the borders were in a continual state of alarm. The most ter rible sufferings were endured by prisoners in the hands of the savage foe, who thought to annihilate the whites. The army was at once re-organized, Gen. An thony Wayne put in command by Washington, and a vigorous campaign inaugurated. Though the savages had been given great aid by the Rrit ish, in direct violation of the treaty of 1783, Gen. Wayne pursued them so vigorously that they could not withstand his army, and, the 20th of August, 1794, defeated them, and utterly annihilated their forces, breaking up their camps, and laying waste their country, in some places under the guns of the British forts. The victory showed them the hopelessness of contending against the whites, and led their chiefs to sue for peace. The Rritish, as at former times, deserted them, and they were again alone, contending against an invincible foe. A grand council was held at Greenville the 3d day of August, 1795, where eleven of the most power ful chiefs made peace with Gen. Wayne on terms of his own dictation. The boundary established by the old treaty of Fort Mclntosh was confirmed, and extended westward from Loramie's to Fort Recovery, and thence southwest to the mouth of the Kentucky River. He also purchased all the territory not before ceded, within certain limits, comprehending, in all, about four-fifths of the State of Ohio. The line was long known as \" The Green ville Treaty line.\" Upon these, and a few other minor conditions, the United States received the Indians under their protection, gave them a large number of presents, and practically closed the war with the savages. where he was shot by the Indians, while begging for his life. The firing at the block-house alarmed the Rullards in their cabin, and hastily barring the door, and securing their arms and ammunition, they fled to the woods, and escaped. After the slaughter was over, the Indians began to collect the plunder, and in doing so discovered the lad Philip Stacy. They were about to dispatch him, but his entrea ties softened the heart of one of the chiefs, who took him as a captive with the intention of adopt ing him into his family. The savages then piled the dead bodies on the floor, covered them with other portions of it not needed for that purpose, and set fire to the whole. The building, being made of green logs, did not burn, the flames con suming only the floors and roof, leaving the walls standing. There were twelve persons killed in this attack, all of whom were in the prime of life, and valuable aid to the settlements. They were well provided with arms, and had they taken the necessary pre cautions, always pressed upon them when visited by the older ones from Marietta, they need not have suffered so terrible a, fate. The Indians, exultant over their horrible victory, went on to Wolf's mills, but here they found the people prepared, and, after reconnoitering the place, made their retreat, at early dawn, to the great re-. lief of the inhabitants. Their number was never definitely known. The news reached Marietta and its adjacent settlements soon after the massacre occurred, and struck terror and dismay into the hearts of all. Many had brothers and sons in the ill-fated party, and mourned their loss. Neither did they know what place would fall next. The Indian hostilities had begun, and they could only hope for peace when the savages were effectually conquered. The next day, Capt. Rogers led a party of men over to the Big Bottom. It was, indeed, a melan choly sight to the poor borderers, as they knew not now how soon the same fate might befall them selves. The fire had so disfigured their comrades that but two, Ezra Putnam and William Jones, were recognized. As the ground was frozen out side, a hole was dug in the earth underneath the block-house floor, and the bodies consigned to one grave. No further attempt was made to settle here till after the peace of 1795. The outbreak of Indian hostilities put a check on further settlements. Those that were estab lished were put in a more active state of defense, and every preparation made that could be made"], [107, "l HISTORY OF OHIO. 97 The only settlement of any consequence made dur ingthe Indian war, was that on the plat of Hamilton, laid out by Israel Ludlow in December, 1794. Soon after, Darius C. Orcutt, John Green, William Mc- Clennan, John Sutherland, John Torrence,Renjamin F. Randolph, Renjamin Davis, Isaac Wiles, Andrew Christy and William Hubert, located here. The town was laid out under the name of Fairfield, but was known only a short time by that name. Until 1801, all the lands on the west side of the Great Miami were owned by the General Government; hence, until after that date, no improvements were made there. A single log cabin stood there until the sale of lands in April, 1801, when a company purchased the site of Rossville, and, in March, 1804, laid out that town, and, before a year had passed, the town and country about it was well settled. The close of the war, in 1795, insured peace, and, from that date, Hamilton and that part of the Miami Valley grew remarkably fast. In 1803, Rutler County was formed, and Hamilton made the county seat. On the site of Hamilton, St. Clair built Fort Hamilton in 1791. For some time it was under the command of Maj. Rudolph, a cruel, arbitrary man, who was displaced by Gen. Wayne, and who, it is said, perished ignobly on the high seas, at the hands of some Algerine pirates, a fitting end to a man who caused, more than once, the death of men under his control for minor offenses. On the return of peace, no part of Ohio grew more rapidly than the Miami Valley, especially that part comprised in Rutler County. While the war with the Indians continued, but little extension of settlements was made in the State. It was too perilous, and the settlers pre ferred the security of the block-house or to engage with the army. Still, however, a few bold spirits ventured away from the settled parts of the Terri tory, and began life in the wilderness. In tracing the histories of these settlements, attention will be paid to the order in which they were made. They will be given somewhat in detail until the war of 1>U2, after which time they become too numerous to follow. The settlements made in Washington \u2014 Marietta and adjacent colonies \u2014 and Hamilton Counties have already been given. The settlement at Gal lia is also noted, hence, the narration can be re sumed where it ends prior to the Indian war of 1795. Refore this war occurred, there were three small settlements made, however, in addition to those in Washington and Hamilton Counties. They were in what are now Adams, Belmont and Morgan Counties. They were block-house settle ments, and were in a continual state of defense. The first of these, Adams, was settled in the winter of 1790-91 by Gen. Nathaniel Massie, near where Manchester now is. Gen. Massie determined to settle here in the Virginia Military Tract \u2014 in the winter of 1790, and sent notice throughout Ken tucky and other Western settlements that he would give to each of the first twenty-five families who would settle in the town he proposed laying out, one in-lot, one out-lot and one hundred acres of land. Such liberal terms were soon accepted, and in a short time thirty families were ready to go with him. After various consultations with his friends, the bottom on the Ohio River, opposite the lower of the Three Islands, was selected as the most eligible spot. Here Massie fixed his sta tion, and laid off into lots a town, now called Manchester. The little confederacy, with Massie at the helm, went to work with spirit. Cabins were raised, and by the middle of March, 1791, the whole town was inclosed with strong pickets, with block-houses at each angle for de fense. This was the first settlement in the bounds of the Virginia District, and the fourth one in the State. Although in the midst of a savage foe, now inflamed with war, and in the midst of a cruel conflict, the settlement at Manchester suf fered less than any of its cotemporaries. This was, no doubt, due to the watchful care of its in habitants, who were inured to the rigors of a front ier life, and who well knew the danger about them. \" These were the Reasleys, Stouts, Washburns, Ledoms, Edgingtons, Denings, Ellisons, Utts, McKenzies, Wades, and others, who were fully equal to the Indians in all the savage arts and stratagems of border war.\" As soon as they had completed preparations for defense, the whole population went to work and cleared the lowest of the Three Islands, and planted it in corn. The soil of the island was very rich, and produced abundantly. The woods supplied an abundance of game, while the river furnished a variety of excellent fish. The inhabitants thus found their simple wants fully supplied. Their nearest neighbors in the new Territory were at Columbia, and at the French settlement at Gallip olis; but with these, owing to the state of the country and the Indian war, they could hold little, if any, intercourse."], [108, "08 HISTORY OF OHIO. The station being established, Massie continued to make locations and surveys. Great precautions were necessary to avoid the Indians, and even the closest vigilance did not always avail, as the ever watchful foe was always ready to spring upon the settlement, could an unguarded moment be ob served. During one of the spring months, Gen. Massie, Israel Donalson, William Lytle and James Little, while out on a survey, were surprised, and Mr. Donalson captured, the others escaping at great peril. Mr. Donalson escaped during the march to the Indian town, and made his way to the town of Cincinnati, aster suffering great hard ships, and almost perishing from hunger. In the spring of 1793, the settlers at Manchester com menced clearing the out-lots of the town. While doing so, an incident occurred, which shows the danger to which they were daily exposed. It is thus related in Howe's Collections : \" Mr. Andrew Ellison, one of the settlers, cleared an out-lot immediately adjoining the fort. He had completed the cutting of the timber, rolled the logs together, and set them on fire. The next morning, before daybreak, Mr. Ellison opened one of the gates of the fort, and went out to throw his logs together. Ry the time he had finished the job, a number of the heaps blazed up brightly, and, as he was passing from one to the other, he ob served, by the light of the fires, three men walking briskly toward him. This did not alarm him in the least, although, he said, they were dark-skinned fellows ; yet he concluded they were the Wades, whose complexions were very dark, going early to hunt. He continued to right his log-heaps, until one of the fellows seized him by the arms, calling out, in broken English, ' How do ? how do ? ' He instantly looked in their faces, and, to his surprise and horror, found himself- in the clutches of three Indians. To resist was useless. \" The Indians quickly moved off with him in the direction of Paint Creek. When breakfast was ready, Mrs. Ellison sent one of her children to ask its father home ; but he could not be found at the log-heaps. His absence created no immedi ate alarm, as it was thought he might have started to hunt, after completing his work. Dinner-time arrived, and, Ellison not returning, the family became uneasy, and began to suspect some acci dent had happened to him. His gun-rack was examined, and there hung his rifles and his pouch. Gen. Massie raised a party, made a circuit around the place, finding, after some search, the trails of four men, one of whom had on shoes; and the fact that Mr. Ellison was a prisoner now became apparent. As it was almost night at the time the trail was discovered, the party returned to the station. Early the next morning, preparations were made by Gen. Massie and his friends to con tinue the search. In doing this, they found great difficulty, as it was so early in the spring that the vegetation was not grown sufficiently to show plainly the trail made by the savages, who took the precaution to keep on high and dry ground, where\u00bbtheir feet would make little or no impres sion. The party were, however, as unerring as a pack of hounds, and followed the trail to Paint Creek, when they found the Indians gained so fast on them that pursuit was useless. \"The Indians took their prisoner to Upper Sandusky, where he was compelled to run the gantlet. As he was a large, and not very active, man, he received a severe flogging. He was then taken to Lower Sandusky, and again compelled to run the gantlet. He was then taken to Detroit, where he was ransomed by a British officer for $100. The officer proved a good friend to him. He sent him to Montreal, whence he returned home before the close of the summer, much to the joy of his family and friends, whose feelings can only be imagined.\" \"Another incident occurred about this time,\" says the same volume, \"which so aptly illustrates the danger of frontier life, that it well deserves a place in the history of the settlements in Ohio. John and Asahel Edgington, with a comrade, started out on a hunting expedition toward Brush Creek. They camped out six miles in a northeast direction from where West Union now stands, and near the site of Treber's tavern, on the road from Chillicothe to Maysville. They had good success in hunting, killing a number of deer and bears. Of the deer killed, they saved the skins and hams alone. They fleeced the bears; that is, they cut off all the meat which adhered to the hide, with out skinning, and left the bones as a skeleton. They hung up the proceeds of their hunt, on a scaf fold out of the reach of wolves and other wild ani mals, and returned to Manchester for pack-horses. No one returned to the camp with the Edgingtons. As it was late in December, few apprehended dan ger, as the winter season was usually a time of re pose from Indian incursions. When the Edgingtons arrived at their camp, they alighted from their horses and were preparing to start a fire, when a platoon of Indians fired upon them at a distance of not more than twenty paces. They had"], [109, "THE NEW PASSENGEE DEPOT, PAN-HANDLE RAILWAY, NEWARK, OHIO."], [110, ""], [111, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 101 evidently found the results of the white men's labor, and expected they would return for it, and pre pared to waylay them. Asahel Edgington fell dead. John was more fortunate. The sharp crack of the rifles, and the horrible yells of the savages as they leaped from their place of ambush, frightened the horses, who took the track for home at full speed. John was very active on foot, and now an opportunity offered which required his utmost speed. The moment the Indians leaped from their hiding-place, they threw down their guns and took after him, yelling with all their power. Edgington did not run a booty race. For about a mile, the savages stepped in his tracks al most before the bending grass could rise. The uplifted tomahawk was frequently so near his head that he thought he felt its edge. He exerted himself to his utmost, while the Indians strove with all their might to catch him. Finally, he be gan to gain on his pursuers, and, after a long race, distanced them and made his escape, safely reach ing home. This, truly, was a most fearful and well-contested race. The big Shawanee chief, Capt. John, who headed the Indians on this occasion, after peace was made, in narrating the particulars, said, \"The white man who ran away was a smart fellow. The white man run; and I run. He run and run ; at last, the white man run clear off from me. The settlement, despite its dangers, prospered, and after the close of the war continued to grow rapidly. In two years after peace was declared, Adams County was erected by proclamation of Gov. St. Clair, the next year court was held, and in 1804, West Union was made the county seat. During the war, a settlement was commenced near the present town of Rridgeport, in Relmont County, by Capt. Joseph Relmont, a noted Dela ware Revolutionary officer, who, because his State could furnish only one company, could rise no higher than Captain of that company, and hence always maintained that grade. He settled on a beautiful knoll near the present county seat, but erelong suffered from a night attack by the In dians, who, though unable to drive him and his companions from the cabin or conquer them, wounded some of them badly, one or two mortally, and caused the Captain to leave the frontier and return to Newark, Del. The attack was made in the spring of 1791, and a short time after, the Captain, having provided for the safety of his family, accepted a commission in St. Clair's army, and lost his life at the defeat of the General in November. Shortly after the Captain settled, a fort, called Dillie's Fort, was built on the Ohio, opposite the mouth of Grave Creek. About two hundred and fifty yards below this fort, an old man, named Tato, was shot down at his cabin door by the Indians, just as he was in the act of entering the house. His body was pulled in by his daugh ter-in-law and grandson, who made an heroic de fense. They were overpowered, the woman slain, and the boy badly wounded. He, however, man aged to secrete himself and afterward escaped to the fort. The Indians, twelve or thirteen in num ber, went off unmolested, though the men in the fort saw the whole transaction and could have punished them. Why they did not was never known. On Captina Creek in this same county, occurred, in May, 1794, the \"battle of Captina,\" a fa mous local skirmish between some Virginians from Fort Raker, and a party of Indians. Though the Indians largely outnumbered the whites, they were severely punished, and compelled to abandon the contest, losing several of their bravest warriors. These were the only settlements made until 1795, the close of the war. Even these, as it will be observed from the foregoing pages, were tem porary in all cases save one, and were maintained at a great risk, and the loss of many valuable lives. They were made in the beginning of the war,and such were their experiences that further attempts were abandoned until the treaty of Greenville was made, or until the prospects for peace and safety were assured. No sooner, however, had the prospect of quiet been established, than a revival of emigration be gan. Refore the war it had been large, now it was largely increased. Wayne's treaty of peace with the Indians was made at Greenville, in what is now Darke County, the 3d of August, 1795. The number of Indians present was estimated at 1,300, divided among the principal nations as follows: 180 Wyandots, 381 Delawares, 143 Shawanees, 45 Ottawas, 46 Chip pewas, 240 Pottawatomies, 73 Miamis and Eel River, 12 Weas and Piankeshaws, and 10 Kicka poos and Kaskaskias. The principal chiefs were Tarhe, Ruckongahelas, Rlack Hoof, Rlue Jacket and Little Turtle. Most of them had been tam pered with by the Rritish agents and traders, but all had been so thoroughly chastised by Wayne, and found that the Rritish only used them as tools, that they were quite anxious to make peace with the \" Thirteen Fires.\" Ry the treaty, former ones"], [112, "102 HISTORY OF OHIO. Creek. Soon after, he was joined by Ichabod Corwin, John Osbourn, Jacob Vorhees, Samuel Shaw, Daniel Ronte and a Mr. Manning. When Lebanon was laid out, in 1803, the two-story log house built in 1797 by Ichabod Corwin was the only building on the plat. It was occupied by Ephraim Hathaway as a tavern. He had a black horse painted on an immense board for a sign, and continued in business here till 1810. The same year the town was laid out, a store was opened by John Huston, and, from that date, the growth of the county was very prosperous. Three years after, the Western Star was established by Judge John McLain, and the current news of the day given in weekly editions. It was one of the first newspapers established in the Territory, outside of Cincinnati. As has been mentioned, the opening of naviga tion in the spring of 1796 brought a great flood of emigration to the Territory. The little settle ment made by Mr. Redell, in the autumn of 1795, was about the only one made that fall ; others made preparations, and many selected sites, but did not settle till the following spring. That spring, colo nies were planted in what are now Montgomery, Ross, Madison, Mahoning, Trumbull, Ashtabula and Cuyahoga Counties, while preparations were in turn made to occupy additional territory that will hereafter be noticed. The settlement made in Montgomery County was begun early in the spring of 1796. As early as 1788, the land on which Dayton now stands was selected by some gentlemen, who designed laying out a town to be named Venice. They agreed with Judge Symmes, whose contract covered the place, for the purchase of the lands. The Indian war which broke out at this time prevented an extension of settlements from the immediate neighborhood of the parent colonies, and the proj ect was abandoned by the purchasers. Soon after the treaty of 1795, a new company, composed of Gens. Jonathan Dayton, Arthur St. Clair, James Wilkinson, and Col. Israel Ludlow, purchased the land between the Miamis, around the mouth of Mad River, of Judge Symmes, and, the 4th of November, laid out the town. Arrangements were made for its settlement the ensuing spring, and donations of lots, with other privileges, were offered to actual settlers. Forty-six persons entered into engagements to remove from Cincinnati to Day ton, but during the winter most of them scat tered in different directions, and only nineteen ful filled their contracts. The first families who were established, the boundary lines confirmed and enlarged, an exchange and delivery of prisoners effected, and permanent peace assured. In the latter part of September, aster the treaty of Greenville, Mr. Bedell, from New Jersey, selected a site for a home in what is now' Warren County, at a place since known as \" Bedell's Sta tion,\" about a mile south of Union Village. Here he erected a block-house, as a defense against the Indians, among whom were many renegades as among the whites, who would not respect the terms of the treaty. Whether Mr. Bedell was alone that fall, or whether he was joined by others, is not now accurately known. However that may be, he was not long left to himself; for, ere a year had elapsed, quite a number of settlements were made in this part of the Territory. Soon after his settlement was made, Gen. David Sutton, Capt. Nathan Kelley and others began pioneer life at Deerfield, in the same locality, and, before three years had gone by, a large number of New Jersey people were established in their homes; and, in 1803, the county was formed from Hamilton. Among the early settlers at Deerfield, was Capt. Robert Benhani, who, with a companion, in 1779, sustained themselves many days when the Captain had lost the use of his legs, and his companion his arms, from musket-balls fired by the hands of the Indians. They were with a large party com manded by Maj. Rodgers, and were furiously attacked by an immense number of savages, and all but a few slain. The event happened during the war of the Revolution, before any attempt was made to settle the Northwest Territory. The party were going down the Ohio, probably to the falls, and were attacked when near the site of Cincinnati. As mentioned, these two men sus tained each other many days, the one having per fect legs doing the necessary walking, carrying his comrade to water, driving up game for him to shoot, and any other duties necessary; while the one who had the use of his arms could dress his companion's and his own wounds, kill and cook the game, and perform his share. They were rescued, finally, by a flat-boat, whose occupants, for awhile, passed them, fearing a decoy, but, becoming convinced that such was not the case, took them on down to Louisville, where they were nursed into perfect health. A settlement was made near the present town of Lebanon, the county seat of Warren County, in the spring of 1796, by Henry Taylor, who built a mill one mile west of the town site, on Turtle"], [113, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 103 made a permanent residence here, arrived on the first day of April, 1796, and at once set about establishing homes. Judge Symmes, however, becoming unable soon after to pay for his purchase, the land reverted to the United States, and the set tlers in and about Dayton found themselves with out titles to their lands. Congress, however, came to the aid of all such persons, wherever they had purchased land of Symmes, and passed a pre-emp tion law, under which they could enter their lands at the regular government price. Some of the set tlers entered their lands, and obtained titles directly from the United States ; others made arrangements with Daniel C. Cooper to receive their deeds from him, and he entered the residue of the town lands. He had been the surveyor and agent of the first company of proprietors, and they assigned to him certain of their rights of pre-emption, by which he became the titular owner of the land. When the State government was organized in 1803, Dayton was made the seat of justice for Montgomery County, erected the same year. At that time, owing to the title question, only five families resided in the place, the other settlers hav ing gone to farms in the vicinity, or to other parts of the country. The increase of the town was gradual until the war of 1812, when its growth was more rapid until 1820, when it was again checked by the general depression of busi ness. It revived in 1827, at the commencement of the Miami Canal, and since then its growth has always been prosperous. It is now one of the best cities in Ohio. The first canal boats from Cincinnati arrived at Dayton January 25, 1829, and the first one from Lake Erie the 24th of June, 1845. In 1825, a weekly line of stages was established between Columbus and Cincinnati, via Dayton. One day was occupied in coming from Cincinnati to Dayton. On the 18th of September, 1808, the Dayton Repertory was established by William McClureand George Smith. It was printed on a foolscap sheet. Soon aster, it was enlarged and changed from a weekly to a daily, and, ere long, found a number of competitors in the field. In the lower part of Miamisburg, in this county, are the remains of ancient works, scattered about over the bottom. About a mile and a quarter southeast of the village, on an elevation more than one hundred feet above the level of the Miami, is the largest mound in the Northern States, ex cepting the mammoth mound at Grave Creek, on the Ohio, below Wheeling, which it nearly equals in dimensions. It is about eight hundred feet around the base, and rises to a height of nearly seventy feet. When first known it was covered with forest trees, whose size evidenced great age. The Indians could give no account of the mound. Excavations revealed bones and charred earth, but what was its use, will always remain a con jecture. One of the most important early settlements was made cotemporary with that of Dayton, in what is now Ross County. The same spring, 1796, quite a colony came to the banks of the Scioto River, and, near the mouth of Paint Creek, began to plant a crop of corn on the bottom. The site had been selected as early as 1792, by Col. Nathaniel Massie* and others, who were so de lighted with the country, and gave such glowing descriptions of it on their return \u2014 which accounts soon circulated through Kentucky \u2014 that portions of the Presbyterian congregations of Caneridge and Concord, in Rourbon County, under Rev. Robert W. Finley, determined to emigrate thither in a body. They were, in a measure, induced to take this step by their dislike to slavery, and a desire for freedom from its baleful influences and the un certainty that existed regarding the validity of the land titles in that State. The Rev. Finley, as a preliminary step, liberated his slaves, and addressed to Col. Massie a letter of inquiry, in December, 1794, regarding the land on the Scioto, of which he and his people had heard such glowing ac counts. \"The letter induced Col. Massie to visit Mr. Finley in the ensuing March. A large concourse of people, who wished to engage in the enterprise, assembled on the occasion, and fixed on a day to meet at the Three Islands, in Manchester, and proceed on an exploring expedition. Mr. Finley also wrote to his friends in Western Pennsylvania * Nathaniel Massie was born in Goocblaod County, Va., Decem ber 28, 1763. In 1780, he engaged, for a sbort time, in the Revolu tionary war. In 1783, he left for Kentucky, where he acted as a surveyor. He was afterward made a Government surveyor, and labored much in that capacity for early Ohio proprietors, being paid in lands, the amounts graded by the danger attached to the Burv^y. In 1791, ho established the settlement at Manchester, and a year or two after, continued bis surveys up the Scioto. Here he was con tinually in great danger from the Indians, but knew well how tc guard against them, and thus preserved himself. In 1796, he estab lished the Chillicothe settlement, and made his home in the Scioto Valley, being now ac extensive land owner by reason of his long surveying service. In 1807, he and Return J. Meigs were compet itors for the office of Governor of Ohio. Meigs was elected, but Ma6Sie contested his eligibility to the office, on the grounds of his absence from the State and insufficiency of time as a resident, as required by the Constitution. Meigs was declared ineligible by the General Assembly, and Massie declared Governor. He, however, resigned the office at once, not desiring it. He was often Repre sentative afterward. He died November 13, 1813."], [114, "104 HISTORY OF OHIO. informing them of the time and place of rendez vous. \" About sixty men met, according to appoint ment, who were divided into three companies, under Massie, Finley and Falenash. They pro ceeded on their route, without interruption, until they struck the falls of Paint Creek. Proceeding a short distance down that stream, they suddenly found themselves in the vicinity of some Indians who had encamped at a place, since called Reeve's Crossing, near the present town of Rainbridge. The Indians were of those who had refused to attend Wayne's treaty, and it was determined to give them battle, it being too late to retreat with safety. The Indians, on being attacked, soon fled with the loss of two killed and several wounded. One of the whites only, Joshua Robinson, was mortally wounded, and, during the action, a Mr. Armstrong, a prisoner among the savages, escaped to his own people. The whites gathered all their plunder and retreated as for as Scioto Rrush Creek, where they were, according to expectation, attacked early the next morning. Again the In dians were defeated. Only one man among the whites, Allen Gilfillan, was wounded. The party of whites continued their retreat, the next day reached Manchester, and separated for their homes. \" After Wayne's treaty, Col. Massie and several of the old explorers again met at the house of Rev. Finley, formed a company, and agreed to make a settlement in the ensuing spring (1796), and raise a crop of corn at the mouth of Paint Creek. According to agreement, they met at Man chester about the first of April, to the number of forty and upward, from Mason and Rourbon Counties. Among them were Joseph McCoy, Renjamin and William Rodgers, David Shelby, James Harrod, Henry, Razil and Reuben Abrams, William Jamison, James Crawford, Samuel, An thony and Robert Smith, Thomas Dick, William and James Kerr, George and James Kilgrove, John Rrown, Samuel and Robert Templeton, Fer guson Moore, William Nicholson and James R. Finley, later a prominent local Methodist minister. On starting, they divided into two companies, one of which struck across the country, while the other came on in pirogues. The first arrived earliest on the spot of their intended settlement, and had commenced erecting log huts above the mouth of Paint Creek, at the ' Prairie Station,' before the others had come on by water. About three hundred acres of the prairie were cultivated in corn that season. \" In August, of this year \u2014 1796 \u2014 Chillicothe* was laid out by Col. Massie in a dense forest. He gave a lot to each of the first settlers, and, by the beginning of winter, about twenty cabins were erected. Not long after, a ferry was established across the Scioto, at the north end of Walnut street. The opening of Zane's trace produced a great change in travel westward, it having pre- viously been along the Ohio in keel-boats or canoes, or by land, over the Cumberland Mountains, through Crab Orchard, in Kentucky. \" The emigrants brought corn-meal in their pi- rogues, and after that was gone, their principal meal, until the next summer, was that pounded in hominy mortars, which meal, when made into bread, and anointed with bear's-oil, was quite pal- atable. \" When the settlers first came, whisky was $4.50 per gallon; but, in the spring of 1797, when the keel-boats began to run, the Monongahela whisky- makers, having found a good market for their fire- water, rushed it in, in such quantities, that the cabins were crowded with it, and it soon fell to 50 cents. Men, women and children, with some excep- tions, drank it freely, and many who had been respectable and temperate became inebriates. Many of Wayne's soldiers and camp-women settled in the town, so that, for a time, it became a town of drunkards and a sink of corruption. There was, however, a little leaven, which, in a few months, began to develop itself. \"In the spring of 1797, one Rrannon stole a great coat, handkerchief and shirt. He and his wife absconded, were pursued, caught and brought back. Samuel Smith was appointed Judge, a jury impanneled, one attorney appointed by the Judge to manage the prosecution, and another the defense ; witnesses were examined, the case argued', and the evidence summed up by the Judge. The jury, having retired a few moments, returned with a verdict of guilty, and that the culprit be sen- tenced according to the discretion of the Judge. The Judge soon announced that the criminal should have ten lashes on his naked back, or that he should sit on a bare pack-saddle on his pony, and that his wife, who was supposed to have had some agency in the theft, should lead the pony to every house in the village, and proclaim, 'This is \u2666Chillicothe appears to have been a favorite name among the Indians, as many localities were known by that name. Col. John Johnston says : \"Chillicothe is the name of one of the principal tribes of the Shawanees. They would say, Chil-i-cotheotnny, i. e., Chillicothe town. The Wyandots would say, for Chillicothe town, 1 Tat-a-ra-ra, Do-tia, or town at the leaning of the bank.\""], [115, "105 HISTORY OF OHIO. Brannon, who stole the great coat, handkerchief and shirt ; ' and that Jaaaes B. Finley, afterward Chaplain in the State Penitentiary, should see the sentence faithfully carried out. Brannon chose the latter sentence, and the ceremony was faith fully performed by his wife in the presence of every cabin, under Mr. Finley's care, after which the couple made off. This was rather rude, but effective jurisprudence. \" Dr. Edward Tiffin and Mr. Thomas Worth ington, of Berkley County, Va., were brothers-in-law, and being moved by abolition principles, liberated their slaves, intending to remove into the Ter ritory. For this purpose, Mr. Worthington visited Chillicothe in the autumn of 1797, and purchased several in and out lots of the town. On one of the former, he erected a two-story frame house, the first of the kind in the village. On his return, having purchased a part of a farm, on which his family long afterward resided, and another at the north fork of Paint Creek, he contracted with Mr. Joseph Yates, a millwright, and Mr. George Haines, a blacksmith, to come out with him the following winter or spring, and erect for him a grist and saw mill on his north-fork tract. The summer, fall and following winter of that year were marked by a rush of emigration, which spead over the high bank prairie, Pea-pea, Westfall and a few miles up Paint and Deer Creeks. \" Nearly all the first settlers were either regular members, or had been raised in the Presbyterian Church. Toward the fall of 1797, the leaven of piety retained by a portion of the first settlers be gan to diffuse itself through the mass, and a large log meeting-house was erected near the old grave yard, and Rev. William Speer, from Pennsylvania, took charge. The sleepers at first served as seats for hearers, and a split-log table was used as a pulpit. Mr. Speer was a gentlemanly, moral man, tall and cadaverous in person, and wore the cocked hat of the Revolutionary era. \"Thomas Jones arrived in February, 1798, bringing with him the first load of bar-iron in the Scioto Valley, and about the same time Maj. Elias Langham, an officer of the Revolution, arrived. Dr. Tiffin, and his brother, Joseph, arrived the same month from Virginia and opened a store not far from the log meeting-house. A store had been opened previously by John McDougal. The 17th of April, the families of Col. Worthington and Dr. Tiffin arrived, at which time the first marriage in the Scioto Valley was celebrated. The parties were George Kilgore and Elizabeth Cochran. The ponies of the attendants were hitched to the trees along the streets, which were not then cleared out, nearly the whole town being a wilderness. Joseph Yates, George Haines, and two or three others, arrived with the families of Tiffin and Worthing ton. On their arrival there were but four shingled roofs in town, on one of which the shingles were fastened with ' pegs. Col. Worthington's house was the only one having glass windows. The sash of the hotel windows was filled with greased paper. \" Col. Worthington was appointed by Gen. Ru fus Putnam, Surveyor General of the Northwest Territory, surveyor of a large district of Congress lands, on the east side of the Scioto, and Maj. Langham and a Mr. Matthews, were appointed to survey the residue of the lands which afterward composed the Chillicothe land district. \"The same season, settlements were made about the Walnut Plains by Samuel McCulloh and others; Springer, Osbourn, Dyer, and Thomas and Elijah Chenowith, on Darly Creek; Lamberts and others on Sippo ; on Foster's Rottom, the Fosters, Samuel Davis and others, while the following fam ilies settled in and about Chillicothe : John Crouse, William Keys, William Lamb, John Carlisle, John McLanberg, William Chandless, the Stoctons, Greggs, Rates and some others. \" Dr. Tiffin and his wife were the first Metho dists in the Scioto Valley. He was a local preacher. In the fall, Worthington's grist and saw mills on the north fork of Paint Creek were finished, the first mills worthy the name in the valley. \" Chillicothe was the point from which the set tlements diverged. In May, 1799, a post office was established here, and Joseph Tiffin made Post master. Mr. Tiffin and Thomas Gregg opened taverns; the first, under the sign of Gen. Anthony Wayne, was at the corner of Water and Walnut streets ; and the last, under the sign of the ' Green Tree,' was on the corner of Paint and Water streets. In 1801, Nathaniel Willis moved in and established the Scioto Gazette, probably, the sec ond paper in the Territory.\"* In 1800, the seat of government of the North west Territory was removed, by law of Congress, from Cincinnati to Chillicothe. The sessions of the Territorial Assembly for that and the next year were held in a small two-story, hewed-log house, erected in 1798, by Razil Abrams.

In the lower room of this wing, Col. Thomas Gibson, Auditor of the Territory, kept his office, and in the upper room a small family lived. In the upper room of the main building a billiard table was kept. It was also made a re sort of gamblers and disreputable characters. The lower room was used by the Legislature, and as a court room, a church or ' a school. In the war of 1812, the building was a rendezvous and barracks for soldiers, and, in 1S40, was pulled down. The old State House was commenced in 1800, and finished the next year for the accommodation of the Legislature and the courts. It is said to be the first public stone edifice erected in the Ter ritory. Maj. William Rutledge, a Revolutionary soldier, did the mason work, and William Guthrie, the carpenter. In 1801 , the Territorial Legislature held their first session in it. In it was also held the Constitutional Convention of Ohio, which be gan its sessions the first Monday in November, 1802. In March, 1803, the first State Legislature met in the house, and continued their sessions here until 1810. The sessions of 1810-11, and 1811 12, were held in Zanesville, and from there re moved back to Chillicothe and held in the old State House till 1816, when Columbus became the permanent capital of the State. Making Chillicothe the State capital did much to enhance its growth. It was incorporated in 1802, and a town council elected. In 1807, the town had fourteen stores, six hotels, two newspa pers, two churches \u2014 both brick buildings \u2014 and over two hundred dwellings. The removal of the capital to Columbus checked its growth a little, still, being in an excellent country, rapidly filling with settlers, the town has always remained a prominent trading center. During the war of 1812, Chillicothe was made a rendezvous for United States soldiers, and a prison established, in which many Rritish prison ers were confined. At one time, a conspiracy for escape was discovered just in time to prevent it. The plan was for the prisoners to disarm the guard, proceed to jail, release the officers, burn the town, and escape to Canada. The plot was fortu nately disclosed by two senior Rritish officers, upon which, as a measure of security, the officers and chief conspirators were sent to the penitentiary at Frankfort, Kentucky. Two or three miles northwest of Chillicothe, on a beautiful elevation, commanding an extensive view of the valley of the Scioto, Thomas Worth- ington,* one of the most prominent and influential men of his day, afterward Governor of the State, in 1806, erected a large stone mansion, the wonder of the valley in its time. It was the most elegant mansion in the West, crowds coming to see it when it was completed. Gov. Worthington named the place Adena, \" Paradise \" \u2014 a name not then considered hyperbolical. The large panes of glass, and the novelty of papered walls especially attracted attention. Its architect was the elder Latrobe, of Washington City, from which place most of the workmen came. The glass was made in Pitts burgh, and the fireplace fronts in Philadelphia, the latter costing seven dollars per hundred pounds for transportation. The mansion, built as it was, cost nearly double the expense of such structures now. Adena was the home of the Governor till his death, in 1827. Near Adena, in a beautiful situation, is Fruit Hill, the seat of Gen. Duncan McArthur,f and later of ex-Gov. William Allen. Like Adena, Fruit Hill is one of the noted places in the Scioto Val ley. Many of Ohio's best men dwelt in the valley ; men who have been an honor and ornament to the State and nation. Another settlement, begun soon after the treaty of peace in 1795, was that made on the Licking River, about four miles below the present city of Newark, in Licking County. In the fall of 1798, John Ratliff and Elias Hughes, while prospecting on this stream, found some old Indian cornfields, and determined to locate. They were from West ern Virginia, and were true pioneers, living mainly by hunting, leaving the cultivation of their small cornfields to their wives, much after the style of * Gov. Worthington was born in Jefferson County, Va., about the year 1769. He settled in Ohio in 1798. He was a firm believer in liberty and came to the Territory after liberating his slaves. He was one of the most efficient men of bis day; was a member of the Constitutional Convention, and was Bent on an important mission to Congress relative to the admission of Ohio to the Union. He was afterward a Senator to Congress, and then Governor. On the expiration of his gubernatorial term, he was appointed a mem ber of the Board of Public Works, in which capacity lie did much to advance the canals and radroads, and other public improve ments. He remained in this office till bis death. t Gen. McArthur was born in Dutchess County, N. Y., in 1772. When tight years of age, his father removed to Western Pennsyl vania. When eighteen years of age, he served in Harmar's campaign. In 1792, he was a very efficient soldier among the front iersmen, and gained their approbation by his bravery. In 1793, he was connected with Gen. Slassie, and afterward was engaged in land speculations and became very wealthy. Ho was made a mem ber of the Legislature, in 1805 ; in 180G, a Colonel, and in 1808, a Major General of the militia. In this capacity ho was in Hull's surrender at Detroit. On his return he waa elected to Congress, and in 1813 commissioned Brigadier General. He was one of the most efficient officers in the war of 1812, and held many important posts. After the war, he was again sent to the Legislature ; in 1822 to Congress, and in 1830 elected Governor of the State.

They were both inveterate Indian-haters, and never allowed an opportunity to pass without carrying out their hatred. For this, they were apprehended after the treaty; but, though it was clearly proven they had murdered some inoffensive Indians, the state of feeling was such that they were allowed to go unpunished. A short time aster their settlement, others joined them, and, in a few years, quite a colony had gathered on the banks of the Licking. In 1802, Newark was laid out, and, in three or four years, there were twenty or thirty families, several stores and one or two hotels. The settlement of Granville Township, in this county, is rather an important epoch in the history of this part of the State. From a sketch pub lished by Rev. Jacob Little in 1848, in Howe's Collections, the subjoined statements are taken: \"In 1804, a company was formed at Granville, Mass., with the intention of making a settlement in Ohio. This, called the Scioto Company, was the third of that name which effected settlements in Ohio. The project met with great favor, and much enthusiasm was elicited, in illustration of which a song was composed and sung to the tune of ' Pleasant Ohio ' by the young people in the house and at labor in the field. We annex two stanzas, which are more curious than poetical : '\"When rambling o'er these mountains And rocks where ivies grow Thick as the hairs upon your head, 'Mongst which you cannot go \u2014 Great storms of snow, cold winds that blow, We scarce can undergo \u2014 Says I, my boys, we'll leave this place For the pleasant Ohio. \" 'Our precious friends that stay behind, We're sorry now to leave; But if they'll stay and break their shins, For them we'll never grieve. Adieu, my friends! \u2014 Come on, my dears, This journey we'll forego, And settle Licking Creek, In yonder Ohio.' \" \" The Scioto Company consisted of one hundred and fourteen proprietors, who made a purchase of twenty-eight thousand acres. In the autumn of 1805, two hundred and thirty-four persons, mostly from East Granville, Mass., came on to the pur chase. Although they had been forty-two days on the road, their first business, on their arrival, hav ing organized a church before they left the East, was to hear a sermon. The first tree cut was that by which public worship was held, which stood just in front of the Presbyterian church. On the first Sabbath, November 16, although only about a dozen trees had been felled, they held divine service, both forenoon and afternoon, on that spot. The novelty of worshiping in the woods, the forest extending hundreds of miles each way ; the hardships of the journey, the winter set ting in, the thoughts of home, with all the friends and privileges left behind, and the impression that such must be the accommodations of anew country, all rushed on their minds, and made this a day of varied interest. When they began to sing, the echo of their voices among the trees was so differ ent from what it was in the beautiful meeting house they had left, that they could no longer restrain their tears. They icept when they remem bered Zion. The voices of part of the choir were, for a season, suppressed with emotion. \"An incident occurred, which many said Mrs. Sigourney should have put into verso. Deacon Theophilus Reese, a Welsh Raptist, had, two or three years before, built a cabin, a mile and a half north, and lived all this time without public wor ship. He had lost his cattle, and, hearing a low ing of the oxen belonging to the Company, set out toward them. As he ascended the hills overlook ing the town plot, he heard the singing of the choir. The reverberation of the sound from hill tops and trees, threw the good man into a serious dilemma. The music at first seemed to be behind, then in the tree-tops, or in the clouds. He stopped, till, by accurate listening, he caught the direction of the sound ; went on and passing the brow of the hill, he saw the audience sitting on the level below. He went home and told his wife that ' the promise of God is a bond ' ; a Welsh proverb, signifying that we have security, equal to a bond, that religion will prevail everywhere. He said : ' These must be good people. I am not afraid to go among them.' Though he could not under stand English, he constantly attended the reading meeting. Hearing the music on that occasion made such an impression on his mind that, when he became old and met the first settlers, he would always tell over this story. The first cabin built was that in which they worshiped succeeding Sabbaths, and, before the close of the winter, they had a schoolhouse and a school. That church, in forty years, received more than one thousand per sons into its membership. \" Elder Jones, in 1806, preached the first ser mon in the log church. The Welsh Baptist"], [118, "108 HISTORY OF OHIO. the ground, built a cabin, and returned for his family. The next spring, he brought them out; and began his life here. The same summer he was joined by William Lapin, Joshua and James Ew ing: and one or two others. When Springer came, he found a white man named Jonathan Alder, who for fifteen years had been a captive among the Indians, and who could not speak a word of English, living with an Indian woman on the banks of Rig Darby. He had been exchanged at Wayne's treaty, and, neglecting to profit by the treaty, was still living in the Indian style. When the whites became numerous about him his desire to find his relatives, and adopt the ways of the whites, led him to discard his squaw \u2014 giving her an unusual allowance \u2014 learn the English language, engage in agricultural pursuits, and be come again civilized. Fortunately, he could remem ber enough of the names of some of his parents' neighbors, so that the identity of his relatives and friends was easily established, and Alder became a most useful citizen. He was very influential with the Indians, and induced many of them to remain neutral during the war of 1812. It is stated that in 1800, Mr. Ewing brought four sheep into the com munity. They were strange animals to the Indians. One day when an Indian hunter and his dog were passing, the latter caught a sheep, and was shot by Mr. Ewing. The Indian would have shot Ewing in retaliation, had not Alder, who was fortunately present, with much difficulty prevailed upon him to refrain. While the southern and southwestern parts of the State were filling with settlers, assured of safety by Wayne's victories, the northern and eastern parts became likewise the theater of activities. Ever since the French had explored the southern shores of the lake, and English traders had car ried goods thither, it was expected one day to be a valuable part of the West. It will be remem bered that Connecticut had ceded a large tract of land to the General Government, and as soon as the cession was confirmed, and land titles became assured, settlers flocked thither. Even before that time, hardy adventurers had explored some of the country, and pronounced it a \"goodly land,\" ready for the hand of enterprise. The first settlement in the Western Reserve, and, indeed, in the northern part of the State, was made at the mouth of Conneaut* Creek, in Ash tabula County, on the 4th of July, 1796. That * Conneaut, in the Seneca language, signifies \"many fish.\" Church was organized in the cabin of David Thomas, September 4, 1808. April 21, 1827, the Granville members were organized into the Granville Church, and the corner-stone of their house of worship laid September 21, 1829. In the fall of 1810, the first Methodist sermon was preached here, and, soon after, a class organized. In 1824, a church was built. An Episcopal church was organized in May, 1827, and a church consecrated in 1838. In 1849, there were in this township 405 families, of whom 214 sustain family worship ; 1431 persons over four teen years of age, of whom over 800 belong to church. The town had 150 families, of whom 80 have family worship. In 1846, the township furnished 70 school teachers, of whom 62 prayed in school. In 1846, the township took 621 peri odical papers, besides three small monthlies. The first temperance society west of the mountains was organized July 15, 1828, in this township; and, in 1831, the Congregational Church passed a by law to accept no member who trafficked in or used ardent spirits.\" It is said, not a settlement in the entire West could present so moral and upright a view as that of Granville Township; and nowhere could so perfect and orderly a set of people be found. Surely, the fact is argument enough in favor of the religion of Jesus. The narrative of Mr. Little also states that, when Granville was first settled, it was supposed that Worthington would be the capital of Ohio, between which and Zanesville, Granville would make a great half-way town. At this time, wild animals, snakes and Indians abounded, and many are the marvelous stories preserved regarding the destruction of the animals and reptiles \u2014 the Indians being bound by their treaty to remain peaceful. Space forbids their repetition here. Suffice it to say that, as the whites increased, the Indians, animals and snakes disappeared, until now one is as much a curiosity as the other. The remaining settlement in the southwest ern parts of Ohio, made immediately after the treaty \u2014 fall of 1795 or year of 1796 \u2014 was in what is now Madison County, about a mile north of where the village of Amity now stands, on the banks of the Big Darby. This stream received its name from the Indians, from a Wyandot chief, named Darby, who for a long time resided upon it, near the Union County line. In the fall of 1795, Benjamin Springer came from Kentucky and selected some land on the banks of the Big Darby, cleared"], [119, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 109 day, the first surveying party landed at the mouth of this creek, and, on its eastern bank, near the lake shore, in tin cups, pledged \u2014 as they drank the limpid waters of the lake \u2014 their country's welfare, with the ordnance accompaniment of two or three fowling-pieces, discharging the required national salute. The whole party, on this occasion, numbered fifty-two persons, of whom two were females (Mrs. Stiles and Mrs. GunnJ and a child, and all deserve a lasting place in the history of the State. The next day, they began the erection of a large log building on the sandy beach on the east side of the stream. When done, it was named \" Stow Castle,\" after one of the party. It was the dwell ing, storehouse and general habitation of all the pioneers. The party made this their headquar ters part of the summer, and continued busily engaged in the survey of the Reserve. James Kingsbury, afterward Judge, arrived soon after the party began work, and, with his family, was the first to remain here during the winter follow ing, the rest returning to the East, or going south ward. Through the winter, Mr. Kingsbury's family suffered greatly for provisions, so much so, that, during the absence of the head of the family in New York for provisions, one child, born in his absence, died, and the mother, reduced by her suf ferings and solitude, was only saved by the timely arrival of the husband and father with a sack of flour he had carried, many weary miles, on his back. He remained here but a short time, re moving to Cleveland, which was laid out that same fall. In the spring of 1798, Alexander Harper, William MeFarland and Ezra Gregory, with their families, started from Harpersfield, Delaware Co., N. Y., and arrived the last of June, at their new homes in the Far West. The whole population on the Reserve then amounted to less than one hun dred and fifty persons. These were at Cleveland, Youngstown and at Mentor. During the summer, three families came to Rurton, and Judge Hudson settled at Hudson. All these pioneers suffered severely for food, and from the fever induced by chills. It took several years to become accli mated. Sometimes the entire neighborhood would be down, and only one or two, who could wait on the rest \"between chills,\" were able to do anything. Time and courage overcame, finally. It was not until 1798, that a permanent settle ment was made at the mouth of Conneaut Creek. Those who came there in 1796 went on with their surveys, part remaining in Cleveland, laid out that | summer. Judge Kingsbury could not remain at Conneaut, and went nearer the settlements made about the Cuyahoga. Inthespring of 1798, Thomas Montgomery and Aaron Wright settled here and remained. Up the stream they found some thirty Indian cabins, or huts, in a good state of preserva tion, which they occupied until they could erect their own. Soon after, they were joined by others, and, in a year or two, the settlement was permanent and prosperous. The site of the present town of Austinburg in Ashtabula County was settled in the year 1799, by two families from Connecticut, who were in duced to come thither, by Judge Austin. The Judge preceded them a short time, driving, in company with a hired man, some cattle about one hundred and fifty miles through the woods, follow ing an old Indian trail, while the rest of the party came in a boat across the lake. When they ar rived, there were a few families at Harpersburg ; one or two families at Windsor, twenty miles southwest; also a few families at Elk Creek, forty miles northeast, and at Vernon, the same distance southeast. All these were in a destitute condition for provisions. In 1800, another family moved from Norfolk, Conn. In the spring of 1801, sev eral families came from the same place. Part came by land, and part by water. During that season, wheat was carried to an old mill on Elk Creek, forty miles away, and in some instances, half was given for carrying it to mill and returning it in flour. Wednesday, October 21, 1801, a church of six teen members was constituted in Austinburg. This was the first church on the Reserve, and was founded by Rev. Joseph Radger, the first mission ary there. It is a fact worthy of note, that in 1802, Mr. Radger moved his family from Ruffalo to this town, in the first wagon that ever came from that place to the Reserve. In 1803, noted revivals occurred in this part of the West, attended by the peculiar bodily phenomenon known as the \" shakes \" or \"jerks.\" The surveying party which landed at the mouth of Conneaut Creek, July 4, 1796, soon completed their labors in this part of the Reserve, and ex tended them westward. Ry the first of September, they had explored the lake coast as far west as the outlet of the Cuyahoga* River, then considered * Cuyahoga, in the Indian language, signifies \" crooked.\" \u2014 Hoire's Collection*. \"The Indians called the river 'Cuyahoghan-uk,' 'Lake Kiver ' It is, emphatically, a Lake river. It rises in lakes and empties into a lake.\" \u2014 Alwater's History of Ohio."], [120, "110 HISTORY OF OHIO. by all an important Western place, and one des tined to be a great commercial mart. Time has verified the prophecies, as now the city of Cleve land covers the site. As early as 1755, the mouth of the Cuyahoga River was laid down on the maps, and the French had a station here. It was also considered an im portant post during the war of the Revolution, and later, of 1812. The Rritish, who, aster the Revolution, refused to abandon the lake country west of the Cuyahoga, occupied its shores until 1790. Their traders had a house in Ohio City, north of the Detroit road, on the point of the hill near the river, when the surveyors arrived in 1796. Washington, Jefferson, and all statesmen of that day, regarded the outlet of the Cuyahoga as an important place, and hence the early at tempt of the surveyors to reach and lay out a town here. The corps of surveyors arrived early in Septem ber, 1796, and at once proceeded to lay out a town. It was named Cleveland, in honor of Gen. Moses Cleveland, the Land Company's agent, and for years a very prominent man in Connecticut, where he lived and died. Ry the 18th of October, the surveyors had completed the survey and left the place, leaving only Job V. Stiles and family, and Edward Paine, who were the only persons that passed the succeeding winter in this place. Their residence was a log cabin that stood on a spot of ground long afterward occupied by the Commercial Rank. Their nearest neighbors were at Conne aut, where Judge Kingsbury lived; at Fort Mclntosh, on the south or east, at the mouth of Rig Reaver, and at the mouth of the river Raisin, on the west. The next season, the surveying party came again to Cleveland, which they made their headquarters. Early in the spring, Judge Kingsbury came over from Conneaut, bringing with him Elijah Gunn, who had a short time before joined him. Soon after, Maj. Lorenzo Carter and Ezekiel Hawley came with their families. These were about all who are known to have settled in this place that summer. The next year, 1798, Rodolphus Ed wards and Nathaniel Doane and their families set tled in Cleveland. Mr. Doane had been ninety two days on his journey from Chatham, Conn. In the latter part of the summer and fall, nearly every person in the settlement was down with the bil ious fever or with the ague. Mr. Doane's family consisted of nine persons, of whom Seth, a lad six teen years of age, was the only one able to care for them. Such was the severity of the fever, that any one having only the ague was deemed quite fortunate. Much suffering for proper food and medicines followed. The only way the Doane family was supplied for two months or more, was through the exertions of this boy, who went daily, aster having had one attack of the chills, to Judge Kingsbury's in Newburg \u2014 five miles away, where the Judgenow lived \u2014 got a peck of corn, mashed it in a hand-mill, waited until a second attack of the chills passed over, and then returned. At one time, for several days, he was too ill to make the trip, during which turnips comprised the chief article of diet. Fortunately, Maj. Carter, having only the ague, was enabled with his trusty rifle and dogs to procure an abundance of venison and other wild game, His family, being somewhat acclimated, suffered less than many others. Their situation can hardly now be realized. \" Destitute of a physician, and with few medicines, necessity taught them to use such means as nature had placed within their reach. They substituted pills from the extract of the bitternut bark for calomel, and dogwood and cherry bark for quinine.\" In November, four men, who had so far recov ered as to have ague attacks no ostener than once in two or three days, started in the only boat for Walnut Creek, Penn., to obtain a winter's supply of flour. When below Euclid Creek, a storm drove them ashore, broke their boat, and compelled their return. During the winter and summer fol lowing, the settlers had no flour, except that ground in hand and coffee mills, which was, how ever, considered very good. Not all had even that. During the summer, the Connecticut Land Com pany opened the first road on the Reserve, which commenced about ten miles south of the lake shore, on the Pennsylvania State line, and extended to Cleveland. In January, 1799, Mr. Doane moved to Doane's Corners, leaving only Maj. Car ter's family in Cleveland, all the rest leaving as soon as they were well enough. For fifteen months, the Major and his family were the only white per sons left on the town site. During the spring, Wheeler W. Williams and Maj. Wyatt built the first grist-mill on the Reserve, on the site of New burg. It was looked upon, as a very valuable acces sion to the neighborhood. Prior to this, each fam ily had its own hand-mill in one of the corners of the cabin. The old mill is thus described by a pioneer : \" The stones were of the common grindstone grit, about four inches thick, and twenty in diame-"], [121, "HISTORY OF OHIO. Ill ter. The runner, or upper, was turned by hand, by a pole set in the top of it, near the outer edge. The upper end of the pole was inserted into a hole in a board fastened above to the joists, immedi ately over the hole in the verge of the runner. One person fed the corn into the eye \u2014 a hole in the center of the runner \u2014 while another turned. It was very hard work to grind, and the operators alternately exchanged places.\" In 1800, several settlers came to the town and a more active life was the result. From this time, Cleveland began to progress. The 4th of July, 1801, the first ball in town was held at Major Carter's log cabin, on the hill-side. John and Benjamin Wood, and R. H. Blinn were managers ; and Maj. Samuel Jones, musician and master of ceremonies. The company numbered aboutthirty, very evenly divided, for the times, between the sexes. \" Notwithstanding the dancers had a rough puncheon floor, and no better beverage to enliven their spirits than sweetened whisky, yet it is doubt ful if the anniversary of American independence was ever celebrated in Cleveland by a more joyful and harmonious company than those who danced the scamper-down, double-shuffle, western-swing and half-moon, that day, in Maj. Carter's cabin.\" The growth of the town, from this period on, re mained prosperous. The usual visits of the Indi ans were made, ending in their drunken carousals and fights. Deer and other wild animals furnished abundant meat. The settlement was constantly augmented by new arrivals, so that, by 1814, Cleve land was incorporated as a town, and, in 1836, as a city. Its harbor is one of the best on the lakes, and hence the merchandise of the lakes has always been attracted thither. Like Cincinnati and Chil licothe, it became the nucleus of settlements in this part of the State, and now is the largest city in Northern Ohio. 1786, to the mouth ofthe Cuyahoga, thence to be shipped on the schooner Mackinaw to Detroit. Col. Hillman generally had charge of all these caravans, consisting sometimes of ninety horses and ten men. They commonly crossed the Big Beaver four miles below the mouth of the She nango, thence up the left bank of the Mahoning \u2014 called by the Indians \" Mahoni\" or \" Mahonick,\" signifying the \"lick.\" or \"at the lick\" \u2014 crossing it about three miles below the site of Youngstown, thence by way of the Salt Springs, over the sites of Milton and Ravenna, crossing the Cuyahoga at the mouth of Breakneck and again at the mouth of Tinker's Creek, thence down the river to its mouth, where they had a log hut in which to store their goods. This hut was there when the surveyors came, but at the time unoccupied. At the mouth of Tinker's Creek were a few log huts built by Moravian Missionaries. These were used only one year, as the Indians had gone to the Tus carawas River. These and three or four cabins at the Salt Springs were the only buildings erected by the whites prior to 1796, in Northeastern Ohio. Those at the Salt Springs were built at an early day for the accommodation of whites who came from Western Pennsylvania to make salt. The tenants were dispossessed in 1785 by Gen. Harmar. A short time aster, one or two white men were killed by the Indians here. In 1788, Col. Hill man settled at Beavertown, where Duncan & Wilson had a store for the purpose of trading with the Indians. He went back to Pittsburgh soon after, however, owing to the Indian war, and remained there till its close, continuing in his busi ness whenever opportunity offered. In 1796, when returning from one of his trading expeditions alone in his canoe down the Mahoning River, he discovered a smoke on the bank near the present town of Youngstown, and on going to the spot found Mr. Young and Mr. Wolcott, as before men tioned. A part of Col. Hillman's cargo consisted of whisky, a gallon or so of which he still had. The price of \" fire-water \" then was $1 per quart in the currency of the country, a deerskin being legal tender for $1, and a doeskin for 50 cents. Mr. Young proposed purchasing a quart, and having a frolic on its contents during the even ing, and insisted on paying Hillman his cus tomary price. Hillman urged that inasmuch as they were strangers in the country, civility re quired him to furnish the means for the entertain ment. Young, however, insisted, and taking the deerskin used for his bed \u2014 the only one he had \u2014 One of the earliest settlements made in the Western Reserve, and by some claimed as the first therein, was made on the site of Youngstown, Ma honing County, by a Mr. Young, afterward a Judge, in the summer of 1796. During this summer, before the settlements at Cuyahoga and Conneaut were made, Mr. Young and Mr. Wilcott, proprie tors of a township of land in Northeastern Ohio, came to their possessions and began the survey of their land. Just when they came is not known. They were found here by Col. James Hillman, then a trader in the employ of Duncan & Wilson, of Pittsburgh, \" who had been forwarding goods across the country by pack-saddle horses since"], [122, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 112 are given as occurring in the next year, 1798, were actually begun earlier, but were only tem porary preparations, and were not considered as made until the next year. Turning again to the southern portion of Ohio, the Scioto, Muskingum and Miami Valleys come prominently into notice. Throughout the entire Eastern States they were still attracting attention, and an increased emigration, busily occupying their verdant fields, was the result. All about Chilli cothe was now well settled, and, up the banks of that stream, prospectors were selecting sites for their future homes. In 1797, Robert Armstrong, George Skidmore, Lucas Sullivant, William Domigan, James Mar shall, John Dill, Jacob Grubb, Jacob Overdier, Arthur O'Hara, John Rrickell, Col. Culbertson, the Deardorfs, McElvains, Selles and others, came to what is now Franklin County, and, in August, Mr. Sullivant and some others laid out the town of Franklinton, on the west bank of the Scioto, oppo site the site of Columbus. The country about this locality had long been the residence of the Wyan dots, who had a large town on the city's site, and cultivated extensive fields of corn on the river bot toms. The locality had been visited by the whites as early as 1780, in some of their expeditions, and the fertility of the land noticed. As soon as peace was assured, the whites came and began a settle ment, as has been noted. Soon after Franklinton was established, a Mr. Springer and his son-in-law, Osborn, settled on the Rig Darby, and, in the sum mer of 1798, a scattering settlement was made on Alum Creek. About the same time settlers came to the mouth of the Gahannah, and along other water-courses. Franklinton was the point to which emigrants came, and from which they always made their permanent location. For several years there was no mill, nor any such commodity, nearer than Chillicothe. A hand-mill was constructed in Franklinton, which was commonly used, unless the settlers made a trip to Chillicothe in a canoe. Next, a horse-mill was tried ; but not till 1805, when Col. Kilbourne built a mill at Worthington, settled in 1803, could any efficient grinding be done. In 1789, asmall store was openedin Frank linton, by James Scott, but, for seven or eight years, Chillicothe was the nearest post office. Often, when the neighbors wanted mail, one of their number was furnished money to pay the postage on any letters that might be waiting, and sent for the mail. At first, as in all new localities, a great deal of sickness, fever and ague, prevailed. paid for his quart of whisky, and an evening's frolic was the result. \" Hillman remained a few days, when they ac companied him to Reaver Town to celebrate the 4th, and then all returned, and Hillman erected a cabin on the site of Youngstown. It is not cer tain that they remained here at this time, and hence the priority of actual settlement is generally conceded to Conneaut and Cleveland. The next year, in the fall, a Mr. Rrown and one other per son came to the banks of the Mahoning and made a permanent settlement. The same season Uriah Holmes and Titus Hayes came to the same locality, and before winter quite a settlement was to be seen here. It proceeded quite prosperously until the wanton murder of two Indians occurred, which, for a time, greatly excited the whites, lest the In dians should retaliate. Through the efforts of Col. Hillman, who had great influence with the natives, they agreed to let the murderers stand a trial. They were acquitted upon some technicality. The trial, however, pacified the Indians, and no trouble came from the unwarranted and unfortu nate circumstance, and no check in the emigration or prosperity of the colony occurred.\"* As soon as an effective settlement had been es tablished at Youngstown, others were made in the surrounding country. One of these was begun by William Fenton in 1798, on the site of the pres ent town of Warren, in Trumbull County. He remained here alone one year, when he was joined by Capt. Ephraim Quimby. Ry the last of Sep tember, the next year, the colony had increased to sixteen, and from that date on continued prosper ously. Once or twice they stood in fear of the Indians, as the result .of quarrels induced by whisky. Sagacious persons generally saved any serious outbreak and pacified the natives. Mr. Radger, the first missionary on the Reserve, came to the settlement here and on the Mahoning, as soon as each was made, and, by his earnest labors, succeeded in forming churches and schools at an early day. He was one of the most efficient men on the Reserve, and throughout his long and busy life, was well known and greatly respected. He died in 1846, aged eighty-nine years. The settlements given are about all that were made before the close of 1797. In following the narrative of these settlements, attention is paid to the chronological order, as far as this can be done. Like those settlements already made, many which * Recollections of Col. Hillman. \u2014 Howe's Annalt."], [123, "113 HISTORY OF OHIO. As the people became acclimated, this, however, disappeared. The township of Sharon in this county has a history similar to that of Granville Township in Licking County. It was settled by a \" Scioto Company,\" formed in Granby, Conn, in the winter of 1801-02, consisting at first of eight associates. They drew up articles of association, among which was one limiting their number to forty, each of whom must be unanimously chosen by ballot, a single negative beingsufficienttopreventan election. Col. James Kilbourne was sent out the succeeding spring to explore the country and select and pur chase a township for settlement. He returned in the fall without making any purchase, through fear that the State Constitution, then about to be formed, would tolerate slavery, in which case the project would have been abandoned. While on this visit, Col. Kilbourne compiled from a variety of sources the first map made of Ohio. Although much of it was conjectured, and hence inaccurate, it was very valuable, being correct as far as the State was then known. \"As soon as information was received that the constitution of Ohio prohibited slavery, Col. Kil bourne purchased the township he had previously selected, within the United States military land district, and, in the spring of 1803, returned to Ohio, and began improvements. Ry the succeed ing December, one hundred settlers, mainly from Hartford County, Conn., and Hampshire County, Mass., arrived at their new home. Obeying to the letter the agreement made in the East, the first cabin erected was used for a schoolhouse and a church of the Protestant Episcopal denomination ; the first Sabbath after the arrival of the colony, divine service was held therein, and on the arrival of the eleventh family a school was opened. This early attention to education and religion has left its favorable impress upon the people until this day. The first 4th of July was uniquely and appropri ately celebrated. Seventeen gigantic trees, em blematical of the seventeen States forming the Union, were cut, so that a few blows of the ax, at sunrise on the 4th, prostrated each successively with a tremendous crash, forming a national salute novel in the world's history.\"* The growth of this part of Ohio continued without interruption until the establishment of the State capital at Columbus, in 1816. The town was laid out in 1812, but, as that date is considered re \u2666Howe's Collections. mote in the early American settlements, its history will be left to succeeding pages, and there traced when the history of the State capital and State government is given. The site of Zanesville, in Muskingum County, was early looked upon as an excellent place to form a settlement, and, had not hostilities opened in 1791, with the Indians, the place would have been one of the earliest settled in Ohio. As it was, the war so disarranged matters, that it was not till 1797 that a permanent settlement was effected. The Muskingum country was principally occu pied, in aboriginal times, by the Wyandots, Dela wares, and a few Seneeas and Shawanees. An In dian town once stood, years before the settlement of the country, in the vicinity of Duncan's Falls, in Muskingum County, from which circumstance the place is often called \" Old Town.\" Near Dres den, was a large Shawanee town, called Wakato maca. The graveyard was quite large, and, when the whites first settled here, remains of the town were abundant. It was in this vicinity that the venerable Maj. Cass, father of Lewis Cass, lived and died. He owned 4,000 acres, given him for his military services. The first settlers on the site of Zanesville were William McCulloh and Henry Crooks. The lo cality was given to Ebenezer Zane, who had been allowed three sections of land on the Scioto, Mus kingum and Hockhocking, wherever the road crossed these rivers, provided other prior claims did not interfere, for opening \" Zane's trace.\" When he located the road across the Muskingum, he selected the place where Zanesville now stands, being attracted there by the excellent water privi leges. He gave the section of land here to his brother Jonathan Zane, and J. Mclntire, who leased the ferry, established on the road over the Muskingum, to William McCulloh and Henry Crooks, who became thereby the first settlers. The ferry was kept about where the old upper bridge was afterward placed. The ferry-boat was made by fastening two canoes together with a stick. Soon after a flat-boat was used. It was brought from Wheeling, by Mr. Mclntire, in 1797, the year after the ferry was established. The road cut out through Ohio, ran from Wheeling, Va., to Maysville, Ky. Over this road the mail was car ried, and, in 1798, the first mail ever carried wholly in Ohio was brought up from Marietta to MeCulloh's cabin by Daniel Coovers, where, by arrangement of the Postmaster General, it met a mail from Wheeling and one from Maysville."], [124, "114 HISTORY OF OHIO. McCulloh, who could hardly read, was authorized to assort the mails and send each package in its proper direction. For this service he received S30 per annum ; but owing to his inability to read well, Mr. Convers generally performed the duty. At that time, the mails met here once a week. Four years after, the settlement had so increased that a regular post office was opened, and Thomas Dowden appointed Postmaster. He kept his office in a wooden building near the river bank. Messrs. Zane and Mclntire laid out a town in 1799, which they called Westbourn. When the post office was established, it was named Zanesville, and in a short time the village took the same name. A few families settled on the west side of the river, soon after McCulloh arrived, and as this locality grew well, not long after a store and tavern was opened here. Mr. Mclntire built a double log cabin, which was used as a hotel, and in which Louis Philippe, King of France, was once enter tained. Although the fore and accommodations were of the pioneer period, the honorable guestseems to have enjoyed his visit, if the statements of Lewis Cass in his \" Camp and Court of Louis Philippe\" may be believed. In 1804, Muskingum County was formed by the Legislature, and, for a while, strenuous efforts made to secure the State capital by the citizens of Zanes ville. They even erected buildings for the use of the Legislature and Governor, and during the ses sion of 1810-11, the temporary seat of govern ment was fixed here. When the permanent State capital was chosen in 1816, Zanesville was passed by, and gave up the hope. It is now one of the most enterprising towns in the Muskingum Valley. During the summer of 1797, John Knoop, then living four miles above Cincinnati, made several expeditions up the Miami Valley and selected the land on which he afterward located. The next spring Mr. Knoop, his brother Renjamin, Henry Garard, Renjamin Hamlet and John Tildus estab lished a station in what is now Miami County, near the present town of Staunton Village. That sum mer, Mrs. Knoop planted the first apple-tree in the Miami * country. They all lived together for greater safety for two years, during which time they were occupied clearing their farms and erect ing dwellings. During the summer, the site of Piqua was settled, and three young men located at a place known as \" Freeman's Prairie.\" Those who *The word Miami in the Indian tongue signified mother. The Miamis were the original owners of the valley by that name, and affirmed they were created there. settled at Piqua were Samuel Hilliard, Job Garard, Shadrac Hudson, Jonah Rollins, Daniel Cox, Thomas Rich, and a Mr. Hunter. The last named came to the site of Piqua first in 1797, and selected his home. Until 1799, these named were the only ones in this locality ; but that year emi gration set in, and very shortly occupied almost all the bottom land in Miami County. With the increase of emigration, came the comforts of life, and mills, stores and other necessary aids to civil ization, were ere long to be seen. The site of Piqua is quite historic, being the theater of many important Indian occurrences, and the old home of the Shawanees, of which tribe Tecumseh was a chief. During the Indian war, a fort called Fort Piqua was built, near the residence of Col. John Johnston, so long the faith ful Indian Agent. The fort was abandoned at the close of hostilities. When the Miami Canal was opened through this part of the State, the country began rapidly to improve, and is now probably one of the best por tions of Ohio. About the same time the Miami was settled, a company of people from Pennsylvania and Vir ginia, who were principally of German and Irish descent, located in Lawrence County, near the iron region. As soon as that ore was made available, that part of the State rapidly filled with settlers, most of whom engaged in the mining and working of iron ore. Now it is very prosperous. Another settlement was made the same season, 1797, on the Ohio side of the river, in Columbiana County. The settlement progressed slowly for a while, owing to a few difficulties with the Indians. The celebrated Adam Poe had been here as early as 1782, and several localities are made locally famous by his and his brother's adventures. In this county, on Little Reaver Creek, near its mouth, the second paper-mill west of the Alle ghanies was erected in 1 805-6. It was the pioneer enterprise of the kind in Ohio, and was named the Ohio Paper-Mill. Its proprietors were John Rever and John Coulter. One of the most noted localities in the State is comprised in Greene County. The Shawanee town, \" Old Chillicothe,\" was on the Little Miami, in this county, about three miles north of the site of Xenia. This old Indian town was, in the an nals of the West, a noted place, and is frequently noticed. It is first mentioned in 1773, by Capt. Thomas Rullitt, of Virginia, who boldly advanced alone into the town and obtained the consent of"], [125, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 115 the Indians to go on to Kentucky and make his settlement at the falls of the Ohio. His audacious bravery gained his request. Daniel Roone was taken prisoner early in 1778, with twenty-seven others, and kept for a time at Old Chillicothe. Through the influence of the Rritish Governor, Hamilton, who had taken a great fancy to Roone, he and ten others were sent to Detroit. The In dians, however, had an equal fancy for the brave frontiersman, and took him back to Chillicothe, and adopted him into their tribe. About the 1st of June he escaped from them, and made his way back to Kentucky, in time to prevent a universal massacre of the whites. In July, 1779, the town was destroyed by Col. John Rowman aud one hundred and sixty Kentuckians, and the Indians dispersed. The Americans made a permanent settlement in this county in 1797 or 1798. This latter year, a mill was erected in the confines of the county, which implies the settlement was made a short time previously. A short distance east of the mill two block-houses were erected, and it was in tended, should it become necessary, to surround them and the mill with pickets. The mill was used by the settlers at \" Dutch Station,\" in Miami County, fully thirty miles distant. The richness of the country in this part of the State attracted a great number of settlers, so that by 1803 the county was established, and Xenia laid out, and des ignated as the county seat. Its first court house, a primitive log structure, was long preserved as a curiosity. It would indeed be a curiosity now. Zane's trace, passing from Wheeling to Mays ville, crossed the Hockhocking* River, in Fairfield County, where Lancaster is now built. Mr. Zane located one of his three sections on this river, covering the site of Lancaster. Following this trace in 1797, many individuals noted the desira bleness of the locality, some of whom determined to return and settle. \" The site of the city had in former times been the home of the Wyandots, who had a town here, that, in 1790, contained over 500 wigwams and more than 1 ,000 souls. Their town was called Tarhee, or, in English, the Crane-toivn, and derived its name from the princi * The word Hock-hock-ing in the Delaware language signifies abolt'e: the Shawanees have it Wen-tha-kagli-nua sepe, ie ; bottle river. John White in the American Pioneer says: \"About seven miles nort iwest of Lancaster, there is a fall in the Hockhocking of about twtnty feet. Above the fill for a Bhort distance, the creek is very narrow and straight forming a neck, while at the falls it suddenly widens on each side and swells into the appearance of the body of a bottle.

Another portion of the tribe then lived at Toby-town, nine miles west of Tarhe-town (now Roy alto wn), and was governed by an inferior chief called Toby. The chief's wig wam in Tarhe stood on the bank of the prairie, near a beautiful and abundant spring of water, whose outlet was the river. The wigwams of the Indians were built of the bark of trees, set on poles, in the form of a sugar-camp, with one square open, fronting a fire, and about the height of a man. The Wyandot tribe that day numbered about 500 warriors. Ry the treaty of Greenville, they ceded all their territory, and the majority, un der their chief, removed to Upper Sandusky. The remainder lingered awhile, loath to leave the home of their ancestors, but as game became scarce, they, too, lest for better hunting-grounds.\"* In April, 1798, Capt. Joseph Hunter, a bold, enterprising man, settled on Zane's trace, on the bank of the prairie, west of the crossings, at a place since known as \"Hunter's settlement.\" For a time, he had no neighbors nearer than the set tlers on the Muskingum and Scioto Rivers. He lived to see the country he had found a wilderness, full of the homes of industry. His wife was the first white woman that settled in the valley, and shared with him all the privations of a pioneer life. Mr. Hunter had not been long in the valley till he was joined by Nathaniel Wilson, John and Al len Green, John and Joseph MeMullen, Robert Cooper, Isaac Shaefer, and a few others, who erected cabins and planted corn. The next year, the tide of emigration came in with great force. In the spring, two settlements were made in Green field Township, each settlement containing twenty or more families. One was called the Forks of the Hockhocking, the other, Yankeetown. Set tlements were also made along the river below Hunter's, on Rush Creek, Raccoon and Indian Creeks, Pleasant Run, Felter'sRun, at Tobeytown, Muddy Prairie, and on Clear Creek. In the fall, \u2014 1799 \u2014 Joseph Loveland and Hezekiah Smith built a log grist-mill at the Upper Falls of the Hockhocking, afterward known as Rock Mill. This was the first mill on this river. In the latter part of the year, a mail route was established over the trace. The mail was carried through on horse back, and, in the settlements in this locality, was left at the cabin of Samuel Coates, who lived on the prairie at the crossings of the river. * Lecture of George Sanderson. \u2014 Howe's Collections."], [126, "116 HISTORY OF OHIO. In the foil of the next year, Ebenezer Zane laid out Lancaster, which, until 1805, was known as New Lancaster. The lots sold very rapidly, at $50 each, and, in less than one year, quite a vil- lage appeared. December 9, the Governor and Judges of the Northwest Territory organized Fairfield County, and made Lancaster the county seat. The year following, the Rev. John Wright, a minister of the Presbyterian Church, came, and from that time on schools and churches were estab- lished and thereafter regularly maintained at this place. . Not for from Lancaster are immense mural es- carpments of sandstone formation. They were noted among the aborigines, and were, probably, used by them as places of outlook and defense. The same summer Fairfield County was settled, the towns of Rethel and Williamsburg, in Cler- mont County, were settled and laid' out, and in 1800, the county was erected. A settlement was also made immediately south of Fairfield County, in Hocking County, by Chris- tian Westenhaver, a German, from near Hagers- town, Md. He came in the spring of 1798, and was soon joined by several families, who formed quite a settlement. The territory included in the county remained a part of Ross, Athens and Fairfield, until 1818, when Hocking County was erected, and Logan, which had been laid out in 1816, was made the county seat. The country comprised in the county is rather broken, especially along the Hockhocking River. This broken country was a favorite resort of the Wyandot Indians, who could easily hide in the numerous grottoes and ravines made by the river and its affluents as the water cut its way through the sandstone rocks. In 1798, soon after Zane's trace was cut through the country, a Mr. Graham located on the site of Cambridge, in Guernsey County. His was then the only dwelling between Wheeling and Zanes- ville, on the trace. He remained here alone about two years, when he was succeeded by George Rey- mer, from Somerset, Penn. Roth these persons kept a tavern and ferry over Will's Creek. In April, 1803, Mr. Reymer was succeeded by John Reatty, who came from Loudon, Va. His family consisted of eleven persons. The Indians hunted in this vicinity, and were frequent visitors at the tavern. In June, 1806, Cambridge was laid out, and on the day the lots were offered for sale, sev- eral families from the Rritish Isle of Guernsey, near the coast of France, stopped here on their way to the West. They were satisfied with the location and purchased many of the lots, and some land in the vicinity. They were soon followed by other families from the same place, all of whom settling in this locality gave the name to the county when it was erected in 1810. A settlement was made in the central part of the State, on Darby Creek, in Union County, in the summer of 1798, by James and Joshua Ewing. The next year, they were joined by Samuel and David Mitchell, Samuel Mitchell, Jr., Samuel Kirkpatrick and Samuel McCullough, and, in 1800, by George and Samuel Reed, Robert Snodgrass and Paul Hodgson. \"James Ewing's farm was the site of an an- cient and noted Mingo town, which was deserted at the time the Mingo towns, in what is now Logan County, were destroyed by Gen. Logan, of Ken- tucky, in 1786. When Mr. Ewing took posses- sion of his farm, the cabins were still standing, and, among others, the remains of a blacksmith's shop, with coal, cinders, iron-dross, etc. Jonathan Alder, formerly a prisoner among the Indians, says the shop was carried on by a renegade white man, named Rutler, who lived among the Mingoes. Extensive fields had formerly been cultivated in the vicinity of the town.\"* Soon after the settlement was established, Col. James Curry located here. He was quite an influ- ential man, and, in 1820, succeeded in getting the county formed from portions of Delaware, Frank- lin, Madison and Logan, and a part of the old In- dian Territory. Marysville was made the county seat. During the year 1789, a fort, called Fort Steu- ben, was built on the site of Steubenville, but was dismantled at the conclusion of hostilities in 1795. Three years after, Rezaleel Williams and Hon. James Ross, for whom Ross County was named, located the town of Steubenville about the old fort, and, by liberal offers of lots, soon attracted quite a number of settlers. In 1805, the town was incorporated, and then had a population of several hundred persons. Jefferson County was created by Gov. St. Clair, July 29, 1797, the year before Steubenville was laid out. It then included the large scope of country west of Pennsylvania ; east and north of a line from the mouth of the Cuyahoga ; southwardly to the Muskingum, and east to the Ohio ; including, in its territories, the cities of Cleveland, Canton, Steubenville and War * Howe's Collections."], [127, ""], [128, ""], [129, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 119 ren. Only a short time, however, was it allowed to retain this size, as the increase in emigration rendered it necessary to erect new counties, which was rapidly done, especially on the adoption c\"the State government. The county is rich in early history, prior to its settlement by the Americans. It was the home of the celebrated Mingo chief, Logan, who resid id awhile at an old Mingo town, a few miles below t le site of Steubenville, the place where the troo is under Col. Williamson rendezvoused on their i i famous raid against the Moravian Indians ; ai d also where Col. Crawford and his men met, wfo u starting on their unfortunate expedition. In the Reserve, settlements were often made remote from populous localities, in accordance with the wish of a proprietor, who might own a tract of country twenty or thirty miles in the interior. In thepresentcounty of Geauga, three families located at Rurton in 1798. They lived at a considerable distance from any other settlement for some time, and were greatly inconvenienced for the want of mills or shops. As time progressed, however, these were brought nearer, or built in their midst, and, ere long, almost all parts of the Reserve could show some settlement, even if isolated. The next year, 1799, settlements were made at Ravenna, Deerfield and Palmyra, in Portage County. Hon. Renjamin Tappan came to the site of Ravenna in June, at which time he found one white man, a Mr. Honey, living there. At this date, a solitary log cabin occupied the sites of Duffalo and Cleveland. On his journey from New England, Mr. Tappan fell in with David Hudson, the founder of the Hudson settlement in Summit County. After many days of travel, they landed at a prairie in Summit County. Mr. Tappan left, his goods in a cabin, built for the purpose, under the care of a hired man, and went on his way, cutting a road to the site of Ravenna, where his land lay. On his return for a second load of goods, they found the cabin deserted, and evidences of its plunder by the In dians. Not long after, it was learned that the man left in charge had gone to Mr. Hudson's settle ment, he having set out immediately on his arrival, for his own land. Mr. Tappan gathered the re mainder of his goods, and started back for Ravenna. On his way one of his oxen died, and he found himself in a vast forest, away from any habitation, and with one dollar in money. He did not falter a moment, but sent his hired man, a faithful fellow, to Erie, Penn., a distance of one hundred miles through the wilderness, with the compass for his guide, requesting from Capt. Lyman, the com mander at the fort there, a loan of money. At the same time, he followed the township lines to Youngstown, where he became acquainted with Col. James Hillman, who did not hesitate to sell him an ox on credit, at a fair price. He returned to his load in a few days, found his ox all right, hitched the two together and went on. He was soon joined by his hired man, with the money, and together they spent the winter in a log cabin. He gave his man one hundred acres of land as a reward, and paid Col. Hillman for the ox. In a year or two he had a prosperous settlement, and when the county was erected in 1807, Ravenna was made the seat of justice. About the same time Mr. Tappan began his settlement, others were commenced in other locali ties in this county. Early in May, 1799, Lewis Day and his son Horatio, of Granby, Conn., and Moses Tibbals and Green Frost, of Granville, Mass., left their homes in a one-horse wagon, and, the 29th of May, arrived in what is now Deerfield Township. Theirs was the first wagon that had ever penetrated farther westward in this region than Canfield. The country west of that place had been an unbroken wilderness until within a few days. Capt. Caleb Atwater, of Wallingford, Conn., had hired some men to open a road to Township No. 1, in the Seventh Range, of which he was the owner. This road passed through Deerfield, and was completed to that place when the party arrived at the point of their destination. These emigrants selected sites, and commenced clearing the land. In July, Lewis Ely arrived from Granville, and wintered here, while those who came first, and had made their improvements, returned East. The 4th of March, 1800, Alva Day (son of Lewis Day), John Campbell and Joel Thrall arrived. In April, George and Rob ert Taylor and James Laughlin, from Pennsylvania, with their families, came. Mr. Laughlin built a grist-mill, which was of great convenience to the settlers. July 29, Lewis Day returned with his family and his brother-in-law, Maj. Rogers, who, the next year, also brought his family. \" Much suffering was experienced at first on account of the scarcity of provisions. They were chiefly supplied from the settlements east of the Ohio River, the nearest of which was Georgetown, forty miles away. The provisions were brought on pack-horses through the wilderness.

The county also contains Rrady 's Pond, a large sheet of water, in which he once made his escape from the Indians, from which circumstance it received its name. \u2022 The locality comprised in Clark County was settled the same summer as those in Summit County. John Humphries came to this part of the State with Gen. Simon Kenton, in 1799. With them came six families from Kentucky, who settled north of the site of Springfield. A fort was erected on Mad River, for security against the In dians. Fourteen cabins were soon built near it, all being surrounded by a strong picket fence. David Lowery, one of the pioneers here, built the first flat-boat, to operate on the Great Miami, and, in 1800, made the first trip on that river, coming down from Dayton. He took his boat and cargo on down to New Orleans, where he disposed of his load of \" five hundred venison hams and bacon.\" Springfield was laid out in March, 1801. Griffith Foos, who came that spring, built a tavern, which he completed and opened in June, remaining in this place till 1814. He often stated that when emigrating West, his party were four days and a half getting from Franklinton, on the Scioto, to Springfield, a distance of forty-two miles. When crossing the Rig Darby, they were obliged to carry all their goods over on horseback, and then drag their wagons across with ropes, while some of the party swam by the side of the wagon, to prevent its upsetting. The site of the town was of such practical beauty and utility, that it soon attracted a large number of settlers, and, in a few years, Springfield was incorporated. In 1811, a church was built by the residents for the use of all denom inations. Clark County is made famous in aboriginal history, as the birthplace and childhood home of the noted Indian, Tecumseh.f He was born in * Howe's Collections. tTecumseh, or Tecumshe, was a son of Puckeshinwa, a member of the Kiscopoko tribe, and Methoataske, of the Turtle tribe of the Shawanee nation. They removed from Florida to Ohio soon after their marriage. The father, Puckeshinwa, rose to the rank of a chief, and fell at tho battle of Point Pleasant, in 1774. After his death the mother, Methoataske, returned to the south, where she died at an advanced age. Tecum\u00b0eh was born about the year 1768. He early Bhowed a passion for war, and, when only 27 years of age, was made a chief. The next year he removed to Deer Creek, in the vicinity of Urbana, and from there to the site of Piqua, on the Great Miami. In 1798 he accepted the invitation of the Delawares in the vicinity of White River, Indiana, and from that time made November 7, the first wedding took place. John Campbell and Sarah Ely were joined in wedlock by Calvin Austin, Esq., of Warren. He was accompanied from Warren, a distance of twenty seven miles, by Mr. Pease, then a lawyer, after ward a well-known Judge. They came on foot, there being no road; and, as they threaded their way through the woods, young Pease taught the Justice the marriage ceremony by oft repetition. \" In 1802, Franklin Township was organized, em bracing all of Portage and parts of Trumbull and Summit Counties. About this time the settlement received accessions from all parts of the East. In February, 1801, Rev. Radger came and began his labors, and two years later Dr. Shadrac Rostwick organized a Methodist Episcopal church.* The remaining settlement in this county, Palmyra, was begun about the same time as the others, by David Daniels, from Salisbury, Conn. The next year he brought out his family. Soon after he was joined by E. N. and W. Raeon, E. Cutler, A. Thurber, A. Preston, N. Rois, J. T. Raldwin, T. and C. Gilbert, D. A. and S. Waller, N. Smith, Joseph Fisher, J. Turtle and others. \" When this region was first settled, there was an Indian trail commencing at Fort Mclntosh (Reaver, Penn.), and extending westward to San dusky and Detroit. The trail followed the highest ground. Along the trail, parties of Indians were frequently seen passing, for several years after the whites came. It seemed to be the great aboriginal thoroughfare from Sandusky to the Ohio River. There were several large piles of stones on the trail in this locality, under which human skeletons have been discovered. These are supposed to be the remains of Indians slain in war, or murdered by their enemies, as tradition says it is an Indian custom for each one to cast a stone on the grave of an enemy, whenever he passes by. These stones appear to have been picked up along the trail, and cast upon the heaps at different times. \"At the point where this trail crosses Silver Creek, Fredrick Daniels and others, in 1814, dis covered, painted on several trees, various devices, evidently the work of Indians. The bark was carefully shaved off two-thirds of the way around, and figures cut upon the wood. On one of these was delineated seven Indians, equipped in a par ticular manner, one of whom was without a head. This was supposed to have been made by a party on their return westward, to give intelligence to * Howe's Collections."], [131, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 121 the old Indian town of Piqua, the ancient Picpia of the Shawanees, on the north side of Mad River, about five miles west of Springfield. The town was destroyed by the Kentucky Rangers under Gen. George Rogers Clarke in 1780, at the same time he destroyed \" Old Chillicothe.\" Immense fields of standing corn about both towns were cut down, compelling the Indians to resort to the hunt with more than ordinary vigor, to sustain them selves and their wives and children. This search insured safety for some time on the borders. The site of Cadiz, in Harrison County, was settled in April, 1799, by Alexander Henderson and his lainily, from Washington County, Penn. When they arrived, they found neighbors in the persons of Daniel Peterson and his family, who lived near the forks of Short Creek, and who had preceded them but a very short time. The next year, emi grants began to cross the Ohio in great numbers, and in five or six years large settlements could be seen in this part of the State. The county was erected in 1814, and Cadiz, laid out in 1803, made the county seat. While the settlers were locating in and about Cadiz, a few families came to what is now Monroe County, and settled near the present town of Beallsville. Shortly after, a few persons settled on the Clear Fork of the Little Muskingum, and a few others on the east fork of Duck Creek. The next season all these settlements received addi tions and a few other localities were also occupied. Before long the town of Beallsville was laid out, and in time became quite populous. The county was not erected until 1813, and in 1815 Woodsfield was laid out and made the seat of justice. The opening of the season of 1800 \u2014 the dawn of a new century \u2014 saw a vast emigration west ward. Old settlements in Ohio received immense increase of emigrants, while, branching out in all directions like the radii of a circle, other settle ments were constantly formed until, in a few years, all parts of the State knew the presence of the white man. Towns sprang into existence here and there ; mills and factories were erected ; post offices and post-routes were established, and the comforts and conveniences of life began to appear. With this came the desire, so potent to the mind of all American citizens, to rule themselves through representatives chosen by their own votes. Hith erto, they had been ruled by a Governor and Judges appointed by the President, who, in turn, appointed county and judicial officers. The arbitrary rulings of the Governor, St. Clair, had arrayed the mass of the people against him, and made the desire for the second grade of government stronger, and finally led to its creation.

SETTLEMENTS increased so rapidly in that part of the Northwest Territory included in Ohio, during the decade from 1788 to 1798, despite the Indian war, that the demand for an election of a Territorial Assembly could not be ignored by Gov. St. Clair, who, having ascertained that 5,000 free males resided within the limits of the Territory, issued his proclamation October 29, 1798, directing the electors to elect representatives to a General Assembly. He ordered the election his home with them. He was most active in the war of 1812 against the Americans, anil from the time he began his work to unite the tribes, his history is so closely identified therewith that the reader is referred to the history of tlmt war in succeeding pages. It may nothe amiss to buy that all stories regarding the manner of his death are considered erroneous. He was undoubtedly killed in the outset of the battle of the Thames in Canada iu 1814, and his body secretly buried by the Indians. to be held on the third Monday in December, and directed the representatives to meet in Cincinnati January 22, 1799. On the day designated, the representatives * assembled at Cincinnati, nominated ten persons, whose names were sent to the President, who selected five to constitute the Legislative Council, *Tbose elected were: from Washington County, Return Jona than Meigs and Pan] Fearing; from Hamilton County, William Gufortb, William McMillan, John Smith, John Ludlow, Robert Benliam, Aaron Caldwell and Isaac Martin; from St. Clair County (Illinois), Shadrach Bond; from Knox County {Indiana'), John Small; from Randolph County (Illinois), Johu Edgar; from Wayne County, Solomon Sibley, Jacob Visgar and Charles F. i habert de Joncaire; from Adams County, Joseph Darlington and Nathaniel Massie; fruni Jefferson County, James Pritchard; from ltoSB (_Vunty, Thumas Worthington, Elias Langhanj, Samuel Findley and Edward Tiffin. The five gentlemen, except Vanderburgh, chosen as the Upper House were all from counties afterward included in Ohio."], [132, "122 HISTORY OF OHIO. or Upper House. These five were Jacob Burnet, James Findley, Henry Vanderburgh, Robert Oliver and David Vance. On the 3d of March, the Senate confirmed their nomination, and the Territorial Government of Ohio* \u2014 or, more prop erly, the Northwest \u2014 was complete. As this comprised the essential business of this body, it was prorogued by the Governor, and the Assembly directed to meet at the same place September 1 6, 1799, and proceed to the enactment of laws for the Territory. That day, the Territorial Legislature met again at Cincinnati, but, for want of a quorum, did not organize until the 24th. The House consisted of nineteen members, seven of whom were from Ham ilton County, four from Ross, three from Wayne, two from Adams, one from Jefferson, one from Washington and one from Knox. Assembling both branches of the Legislature, Gov. St. Clair addressed them, recommending such measures to their consideration as, in his judgment, were suited to the condition of the country. The Council then organized, electing Henry Vanderburgh, Presi dent ; William C. Schenck, Secretary; George Howard, Doorkeeper, and Abraham Carey, Ser geant-at-arms. The House also organized, electing Edward Tif fin, Speaker ; John Reilly, Clerk ; Joshua Row land, Doorkeeper, and Abraham Carey, Sergeant at-arms. This was the first legislature elected in the old Northwestern Territory. During its first session, it passed thirty bills, of which the Governor vetoed eleven. They also elected William Henry Harri son, then Secretary of the Territory, delegate to Congress. The Legislature continued in session till December 19, having much to do in forming new laws, when they were prorogued by the Gov ernor, until the first Monday in November, 1800. The second session was held in Chillicothe, which had been designated as the seat of government by Congress, until a permanent capital should be selected. May 7, 1800, Congress passed an act establish ing Indiana Territory, including all the country west of the Great Miami River to the Mississippi, and appointed William Henry Harrison its Gov ernor. At the autumn session of the Legislature * Ohio oever existed as a Territory proper. It was known, both before and after the division of the Northwest Territory, as the \"Territory northwest of the Ohio River.\" Still, as the country comprised in its limits was the principal theater of action, the short resume given here is made necessary in the logical course of events. Ohio, as Ohio, never existed until the creation of the State in March, 1803. of the eastern, or old part of the Territory, Will- iam McMillan was elected to the vacancy caused by this act. By the organization of this Territory, the counties of Knox, St. Clair and Randolph, were taken out of the jurisdiction of the old Ter- ritory, and with them the representatives, Henry Vandenburgh, Shadrach Bond, John Small and John Edgar. Before the time for the next Assembly came, a new election had occurred, and a few changes were the result. Robert Oliver, of Marietta, was cho- sen Speaker in the place of Henry Vanderburgh. There was considerable business at this session ; several new counties were to be erected ; the coun- try was rapidly filling with people, and where the scruples of the Governor could be overcome, some organization was made. He was very tenacious of his power, and arbitrary in his rulings, affirming that he, alone, had the power to create new coun- ties. This dogmatic exercise of his veto power, his rights as ruler, and his defeat by the Indians, all tended against him, resulting in his displace- ment by the President. This was done, however, just at the time the Territory came from the second grade of government, and the State was created. The third session of the Territorial Legislature continued from November 24, 1801, to January 23, 1802, when it adjourned to meet in Cincin nati, the fourth Monday in November, but owing to reasons made obvious by subsequent events, was never held, and the third session marks the decline of the Territorial government. April 30, 1802, Congress passed an act \"to enable the people of the eastern division of the territory northwest of the Ohio River, to form a constitution and State government, and for the admission of such States into the Union on an equal footing with the original States, and for other purposes.\" In pursuance of this act, an election had been held in this part of the Territory, and members of a constitutional convention cho sen, who were to meet at Chillicothe, November 1, to perform the duty assigned! them. The people throughout the country contemplat ed in the new State were anxious for the adoption of a State government. The arbitrary acts of the Territorial Governor had heightened this feeling ; the census of the Territory gave it the lawful number of inhabitants, and nothing stood in its way. The convention met the day designated and proceeded at once to its duties. When the time arrived for the opening of the Fourth Territorial"], [133, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 123 Legislature, the convention was in session and had evidently about completed its labors. The mem bers of the Legislature (eight of whom were mem bers of the convention) seeing that a speedy termination of the Territorial government was inev itable, wisely concluded it was inexpedient and unnecessary to hold the proposed session. The convention concluded its labors the 29th of November. The Constitution adopted at that time, though rather crude in some of its details, was an excellent organie instrument, and remained almost entire until 1851, when the present one was adopted. Either is too long for insertion here, but either will well pay a perusal. The one adopted by the convention in 1802 was never submitted to the people, .owing to the circumstances of the times ; but dt was submitted to Congress February 19, 1803, and by that body accepted, and an act passed admitting Ohio to the Union. The Territorial government ended March 3, 1803, by the organization, that day, of the State government, which organization defined the pres ent limits of the State. \"' We, the people of the Eastern Division of the Ter ritory of the United States, Northwest -of the River Ohio, having the right-of admission into the General Government as. a member ids the Union, consistent with tb\u00a3 -Constitution 'of the United States, the Ordinance of Cengrese of one thousand seven hundred and eighty seven, and of the lasw of Congress, entitled 'An act to enable the people of the Eastern Division of the Terri tory of the United States Northwest of tbe River Ohio, to form a Constitution and a State Government, and for the admission of such State into the Union on an equal footing with tbe original States, and for other purpo ses;' in order to establish justice, promote tbe well fare and secure tbe blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish the follow ing Constitution or form of government; and do mu tually agree with each other to form ourselves into a free and independent State, by the name of the State of Ohio.\"* \u2014 Preamble, Constitution of 1S0Z. When the convention forming the Constitution, completed its labors and presented the Tesults to Congress, and that body passed the act forming * The name of the State is derived from the river forming its southern iKiundary. Its origin is somewhat obscure, but is com monly ascribed to the Indians. On this point. Col. Johnston says: \" The Sliawanoese called tbe Ohio River 'Kis-ke-piAa, Sepe, i. e., 'Eigle River.' The Wyandots were in the country generations betore tbe Shawanoese, aud, consequently, their nameof the river is the prim itive one and should stand in preferenco to all others. Ohio may be called an improvement on the expression, 'O'he-zuh,' and was, no doubt, adopted fey the early French voyagers in their boat-songs, and is subslantially the same won as used by the Wyandots: the meaning applied by the French, fair and beautiful ' la belle river,' being tbe same precisely as that meant by the Indians \u2014 'great, grand and fair to look upon.' \" \u2014 Howe's Collections. Webster's Dictionary gives the word as of Indian origin, and its meaning to be, \" Beautiful.\" the State, the territory included therein was di vided into nine counties, whose names and dates of erection were as follows: Washington, July 27, 1788; Hamilton, Janu ary 2, 1790; (owing to the Indian war no other counties were erected till peace was restored); Ad ams, July 10, 1797; Jefferson, July 29, 1797; Ross, August 20, 1798; Clermont, Fairfield and Trumbull, December 9, 1800; Belmont, Septem ber 7, 1801. These counties were the thickest settled part of the State, yet many other localities needed organization and were clamoring for it, but owing to St. Clair's views, he refused to grant their requests. One of the first acts on the as sembling of the State Legislature, March 1, 1803, was the creation of seven new counties, viz., Gal lia, Scioto, Geauga, Butler, Warren, Greene and Montgomery. Section Sixth of the \"Schedule\" of the Consti tution required an election for the various officers and Representatives necessary under the new gov ernment, to be held the second Tuesday of Janu ary, 1803, these officers to take their seats and as sume their duties March 3. The Second Article provided for the regular elections, to be held on the second Tuesday of October, in each year. The Governor elected at first was to hold his office until the first regular election could be held, and thereafter to continue in office two years. The January elections placed Edward Tiffin in the Governor's office, sent Jeremiah Morrow to Congress, and chose an Assembly, who met on the day designated, at Chillicothe. Michael Baldwin was chosen Speaker of the House, and Nathaniel Massie, of the Senate. The Assembly appointed William Creighton, Jr., Secretary of State ; Col. Thomas Gibson, Auditor ; William McFarland, Treasurer; Return J. Meigs, Jr., Samuel Hun tington and William Sprigg, Judges of the Su preme Court; Francis Dunlevy, Wyllys Silliman and Calvin Pease, President Judges of the First, Second and Third Districts, and Thomas Worth ington and John Smith, United States Senators. Charles Willing Byrd was made the United States District Judge. The act of Congress forming the State, con tained certain requisitions regarding public schools, the \" salt springs,\" public lands, taxation of Gov ernment lands, Symmes' purchase, etc., which the constitutional convention agreed to with a few minor considerations. These Congress accepted, and passed the act in accordance thereto. The First General Assembly found abundance of work"], [134, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 124 forest with arms and ammunition as occasion offered, endeavoring to stir them up against the Americans, until events here and on the high seas culminated in a declaration of hostilities, and the war of 1812 was the result. The deluded red men found then, as they found in 1795, that they were made tools by a stronger power, and dropped when the time came that they were no longer needed. Before the opening of hostilities occurred, how ever, a series of acts passed the General Assembly, causing considerable excitement. These were the famous \" Sweeping Resolutions,\" passed in 1810. For a few years prior to their passage, considera ble discontent prevailed among many of the legis lators regarding the rulings of the courts, and by many of these embryo law-makers, the legislative power was considered omnipotent. They could change existing laws and contracts did they desire to, thought many of them, even if such acts con flicted with the State and National Constitutions. The \" Sweeping Resolutions \" were brought about mainly by the action of the judges in declaring that justices of the peace could, in the collection of debts, hold jurisdiction in amounts not exceed ing fifty dollars without the aid of a jury. The Constitution of the United States gave the jury control in all such cases where the amount did not exceed twenty dollars. There was a direct con tradiction against the organic law of the land \u2014 to which every other law and act is subversive, and when the judges declared the legislative act uncon stitutional and hence null and void, the Legisla ture became suddenly inflamed at their independ ence, and proceeded at once to punish the admin istrators of justice. The legislature was one of the worst that ever controlled the State, and was composed of many men who were not only igno rant of common law, the necessities of a State, and the dignity and true import of their office, but were demagogues in every respect. Having the power to impeach officers, that body at once did so, having enough to carry a two-thirds majority, and removed several judges. Further maturing their plans, the \" Sweepers,\" as they were known, construed the law appointing certain judges and civil officers for seven years, to mean seven years from the organization of the State, whether they had been officers that length of time or not. All officers, whether of new or old counties, were con strued as included in the act, and, utterly ignoring the Constitution, an act was passed in January, 1810, removing every civil officer in the State. to do regarding these various items, and, at once, set themselves to the task. Laws were passed re garding all these ; new counties created ; officers appointed for the same, until they could be elected, and courts and machinery of government put in motion. President Judges and lawyers traveled their circuits holding courts, often in the open air or in a log shanty ; a constable doing duty as guard over a jury, probably seated on a log under a tree, or in the bushes. The President Judge in structed the officers of new counties iu their duties, and though the whole keeping of matters accorded with the times, an honest feeling generally pre vailed, inducing each one to perform his part as effectually as his knowledge permitted. The State continually filled with people. New towns arose all over the country. Excepting the occasional sicknesses caused by the new climate and fresh soil, the general health of the people im proved as time went on. They were fully in ac cord with the President, Jefferson, and carefully nurtured those principles of personal liberty en grafted in the fundamental law of 1787, and later, in the Constitution of the State. Little if any change occurred in the natural course of events, following the change of govern ment until Burr's expedition and plan of secession in 1805 and 180G appeared. What his plans were, have never been definitely ascertained. His action related more to the General Government, yet Ohio was called upon to aid in putting down his insurrection \u2014 for such it was thought to be\u2014 and defeated his purposes, whatever they were. His plans ended only in ignominious defeat ; the breaking-up of one of the finest homes in the Western country, and the expulsion of himself and all those who were actively engaged in his scheme, whatever its imports were. Again, for a period of four or five years, no exciting events occurred. Settlements continued ; mills and factories increased ; towns and cities grew ; counties were created ; trade enlarged, and naught save the common course of events trans pired to mark the course of time. Other States were made from the old Northwest Territory, all parts of which were rapidly being occupied by settlers. The danger from Indian hostilities was little, and the adventurous whites were rapidly occupying their country. One thing, however, was yet a continual source of annoyance to the Americans, viz., the British interference with the Indians. Their traders did not scruple, nor fail on every opportunity, to aid these sons of the"], [135, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 125 February 10, they proceeded to fill all these va cant offices, from State officers down to the lowest county office, either by appointment or by ordering an election in the manner prescribed by law. The Constitution provided that the office of judges should continue for seven years, evidently seven years from the time they were elected, and not from the date of the admission of the State, which latter construction this headlong Legisla ture had construed as the meaning. Many of the counties had been organized but a year or two, others three or four years ; hence an indescribable confusion arose as soon as the new set of officers were appointed or elected. The new order of things could not be made to work, and finally, so utterly impossible did the injustice of the proceed ings become, that it was dropped. The decisions of the courts were upheld, and the invidious doc trine of supremacy in State legislation received such a check that it is not likely ever to be repeated. Another act of the Assembly, during this pe riod, shows its construction. ' Congress had granted a township of land for the use of a university, and located the township in Symmes' purchase. This Assembly located the university on land outside of this purchase, ignoring the act of Congress, as they had done before, showing not only ignorance of the true scope of law, but a lack of respect un becoming such bodies. .The seat of government was also moved from Chillicothe to Zanesville, which vainly hoped to be made the permanent State capital, but the next session it was again taken to Chillicothe, and com missioners appointed to locate a permanent capital site. These commissioners were James Findley, Jo seph Darlington, Wyllys Sillimau, Reason Beall, and William McFarland. It is stated that they reported at first in favor of Dublin, a small town on the Scioto about fourteen miles above Colum bus. At the session of 1812-13, the Assembly accepted the proposals of Col. James Johnston, Alexander McLaughlin, John Kerr, and Lyne Starling, who owned the site of Columbus. The Assembly also decreed that the temporary seat of government should remain at Chillicothe until the buildings necessary for the State officers should be erected, when it would be taken there, forever to remain. This was done in 1816, in December of that year the first meeting of the Assembly being held there. The site selected for the capital was on the east bank of the Scioto. about a mile below its junction with the Olentangy. Wide streets were laid out, and preparations for a city made. The expecta tions of the founders have been, in this respect, re alized. The town was laid out in the spring of 1812, under the direction of Moses Wright. A short time after, the contract for making it the capital was signed. June 18, the same day war was declared against Great Britain, the sale of lots took place. Among the early settlers were George McCor mick, George B. Harvey, John Shields, Michael Patton, Alexander Patton, William Altman, John Collett, William McElvain, Daniel Kooser, Peter Putnam, Jacob Hare, Christian Heyl, Jarvis, George and Benjamin Pike, William Long, and Dr. John M. Edminson. In 1814, a house of worship was built, a school opened, a newspaper \u2014 The Western Intelligencer and Columbus Gazette, now the Ohio State Journal \u2014 was started, and the old State House erected. In 1816, the \"Borough of Columbus\" was incorporated, and a mail route once a we#k between Chillicothe and Columbus started. In 1819, the old United States Court House was erected, and the seat of justice removed from Franklinton to Columbus. Until 1826, times were exceedingly \" slow \"in the new capital, and but lit tle growth experienced. The improvement period revived the capital, and enlivened its trade and growth so that in 1834, a city charter was granted. The city is now about third in size in the State, and contains many of the most prominent public institutions. The present Capitol building, one of the best in the West, is patterned somewhat after the national Capitol at Washington City. From the close of the agitation of the \" Sweeping Resolutions,\" until the opening of the war of 1812, but a short time elapsed. In fact, scarcely had one subsided, ere the other was upon the country. Though the war was national, its theater of opera tions was partly in Ohio, that State taking an act ive part in its operations. Indeed, its liberty depended on the war."], [136, "126 HISTORY OF OHIO.

IN June, 1812, war was declared against Great Britain. Before this, an act was passed by Con- gress, authorizing the increase of the regular army to thirty-five thousand troops, and a large force of volunteers, to serve twelve months. Under this act, Return J. Meigs, then Governor of Ohio, in April and May, 1812, raised three regiments of troops to serve twelve months. They rendez- voused at Dayton, elected their officers, and pre- pared for the campaign. These regiments were numbered First, Second and Third. Duncan Mc- Arthur was Colonel of the First ; James Findlay, of the Second, and Lewis Cass, of the Third. Early in June these troops marched to Urbana, where they were joined by Boyd's Fourth Regiment of regular troops, under command of Col. Miller, who had been in the battle of Tippecanoe. Near the middle of June, this little army of about twenty-five hundred men, under command of Gov. William Hull, of Michigan, who had been author- ized by Congress to raise the troops, started on its northern march. By the end of June, the army had reached the Maumee, after a very severe march, erecting, on the way, Forts Me Arthur, Ne- cessity and Findlay. By some carelessness on the part of the American Government, no official word had been sent to the frontiers regarding the war, while the British had taken an early precaution to prepare for the crisis. Gov. Hull was very care- ful in military etiquette, and refused to march, or do any offensive acts, unless commanded by his superior officers at Washington. While at the Maumee, by a careless move, all his personal effects, including all his plans, number and strength of his army, etc., fell into the hands of the enemy.- His campaign ended only in ignominious defeat, and well-nigh paralyzed future efforts. All Mich igan fell into the hands of the British. The com mander, though a good man, lacked bravery and promptness. Had Gen. Harrison been in com mand no such results would have been the case, and the war would have probably ended at the outset. Before Hull had surrendered, Charles Scott, Governor of Kentucky, invited Gen. Harrison, Governor of Indiana Territory, to visit Frankfort, to consult on the subject of defending the North- west. Gov. Harrison had visited Gov. Scott, and in August, 1812, accepted the appointment of Major General in the Kentucky militia, and, by hasty traveling, on the receipt of the news of the surrender of Detroit, reached Cincinnati on the morning of the 27th of that month. On the 30th he left Cincinnati, and the next day overtook the army he was to command, on its way to Dayton. After leaving Dayton, he was overtaken by an ex- press, informing him of his appointment by the Government as Commander-in-Chief of the armies of the Indiana and Illinois Territories. The army reached Piqua, September 3. From this place Harrison sent a body of troops to aid in the de- fense of Fort Wayne, threatened by the enemy. On the 6th he ordered all the troops forward, and while on the march, on September 17, he was informed of his appointment as commander of the entire Northwestern troops. He found the army poorly clothed for a winter campaign, now ap- proaching, and at once issued a stirring address to the people, asking for food and comfortable cloth- ing. The address was not in vain. After his appointment, Gen. Harrison pushed on to Au- glaize, where, leaving the army under command of Gen. Winchester, he returned to the interiorof the State, and establishing his headquarters at Frank- linton, began active measures for the campaign. Early in March, 1812, Col. John Miller raised, under orders, a regiment of infantry in Ohio, and in July assembled his enlisted men at Chillicothe, where, placing them \u2014 only one hundred and forty in number \u2014 under command of Captain Angus Lewis, he sent them on to the frontier. They erects ed a block-house at Piqua and then went on to Defiance, to the main body of the armv. In July, 1812, Gen. Edward W. \"supper, of Galba County, raised one thousand men for six months' duty. Under orders from Gen. Winches ter, they marched through Chillicothe and Urbana, on to the Maumee, where, near the lower end of the rapids, they made an ineffectual attempt to drive off the enemy. Failing in this, the enemy"], [138, "128 HISTORY OF OHIO. attacked Tupper and his troops, who, though worn down with the march and not a little disorganized through the jealousies of the officers, withstood the attack, and repulsed the British and their red allies, who returned to Detroit, and the Americans to Fort McArthur. In the fall of 1812, Gen. Harrison ordered a detachment of six hundred men, mostly mounted, to destroy the Indian towns on the Missisineway River, one of the head-waters of the Wabash. The winter set in early and with unusual severity. At the same time this expedition was carried on, Bonaparte was retreating from Moscow. The expe dition accomplished its design, though the troops suffered greatly from the cold, no less than two hundred men being more or less frost bitten. Gen. Harrison determined at once to retake Michigan and establish a line of defense along the southern shores of the lakes. Winchester was sent to occupy Forts Wayne and Defiance; Perkins' brigade to Lower Sandusky, to fortify an old stockade, and some Pennsylvania troops and artil lery sent there at the same time. As soon as Gen. Harrison heard the results of the Missis ineway expedition, he went to Chillicothe to con sult with Gov. Meigs about further movements, and the best methods to keep the way between the Upper Miami and the Maumee continually open. He also sent Gen. Winchester word to move for ward to the rapids of the Maumee and prepare for winter quarters. This Winchester did by the middle of January, 1813, establishing himself on the northern bank of the river, just above Wayne's old battle-ground. He was well fixed here, and was enabled to give his troops good bread, made from corn gathered in Indian corn-fields in this vicinity. While here, the inhabitants of Frenchtown, on the Raisin River, about twenty miles from Detroit, sent Winchester word claiming protection from the threatened British and Indian invasion, avowing themselves in sympathy with the Americans. A council of war decided in favor of their request, and Col. Lewis, with 550 men, sent to their relief. Soon after, Col. Allen was sent with more troops, and the enemy easily driven away from about Frenchtown. Word was sent to Gen. Winchester, who determined to march with all the men he could spare to aid in holding the post gained. He left, the 19th of January, with 250 men, and ar rived on the evening of the 20th. Failing to take the necessary precaution, from some unex plained reason, the enemy came up in the night, established his batteries, and, the next day* sur- prised and defeated the American Army with a terrible loss. Gen. Winchester was made a pris oner, and, finally, those who were intrenched in the town surrendered, under promise of Proctor, the British commander, of protection from the Indians. This promise was grossly violated the next day. The savages were allowed to enter the town and enact a massacre as cruel and bloody as any in the annals of the war, to the everlasting ignominy of the British General and his troops. Those of the American Army that escaped, ar rived at the rapids on the evening of the 22d of January, and soon the sorrowful news spread throughout the army and nation. Gen. Harrison set about retrieving the disaster at once. Delay could do no good. A fort was built at the rapids, named Fort Meigs, and troops from the south and west hurriedly advanced to the scene of action. The investment and capture of Detroit was aban doned, that winter, owing to the defeat at French town, and expiration of the terms of service of many of the troops. Others took their places, all parts of Ohio and bordering States sending men. The erection of Fort Meigs was an obstacle in the path of the British they determined to remove, and, on the 28th of February, 1813, a large band of British and Indians, under command of Proc tor, Tecumseh, Walk-in-the- water, and other In dian chiefs, appeared in the Maumee in boats, and prepared for the attack. Without entering into details regarding the investment of the fort, it is only necessary to add, that after a prolonged siege, lasting to the early part of May, the British were obliged to abandon the fort, having been severely defeated, and sailed for the Canadian shores. Next followed the attacks on Fort Stephenson, at Lower Sandusky, and other predatory excur sions, by the British. All of these failed of their design; the defense of Maj. Croghan and his men constituting one of the most brilliant actions of the war. For the gallant defense of Fort Stephenson by Maj. Croghan, then a young man, the army merited the highest honors. The ladies of Chillicothe voted the heroic Major a fine sword, while the whole land rejoiced at the exploits of him and his band. The decisive efforts of the army, the great num bers of men offered \u2014 many of whom Gen. Harrison was obliged to send home, much to their disgust \u2014 Perry's victory on Lake Erie, September 10, 1813 \u2014 all presaged the triumph of the American arms, soon to ensue. As soon as the battle on the lake was over, the British at Maiden burned"], [139, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 129 their stores, and fled, while the Americans, under their gallant commander, followed them in Perry's vessel to the Canada shore, overtaking them on the River Thames, October 5. In the battle that ensued, Tecumseh was slain, and the British Army routed. The war was now practically closed in the West. Ohio troops had done nobly in defending their northern frontier, and in regaining the Northwest ern country. Gen. Harrison was soon after elected to Congress by the Cincinnati district, and Gen. Duncan McArthur was appointed a Brigadier General in the regular army, and assigned to the command in his place. Gen. McArthur made an expedition into Upper Canada in the spring of 1814, destroying considerable property, and driv ing the British farther into their own dominions. Peace was declared early in 1815, and that spring, the troops were mustered out of service at Chilli cothe, and peace with England reigned supreme. The results of the war in Ohio were, for awhile, similar to the Indian war of 1795. It brought many people into the State, and opened new por tions, before unknown. Many of the soldiers im mediately invested their money in lands, and became citizens. The war drove many people from the Atlantic Coast west, and as a result much money, for awhile, circulated. Labor and provisions rose, which enabled both workmen and tradesmen to enter tracts of land, and aided emigration. At the conclusion of Wayne's war in 1795, probably not more than five thousand people dwelt in the limits of the State ; at the close of the war of 1812, that number was largely increased, even with the odds of war against them. After the last war, the emigration was constant and gradual, building up the State in a manner that betokened a healthful life. As soon as the effects of the war had worn off, a period of depression set in, as a result of too free speculation indulged in at its close. Gradu ally a stagnation ofCjusiness ensued, and many who found themgeJFes unable to meet contracts made in \" flush \" times, fo,u-ud no alternative but to fail. Tpfielieye *^e pressure in all parts of the West, Congress, about 1815, reduced the price of public lands from $2 to $1.25 per acre. This measure worked no little hardship on those who^-owned large tracts of lands, for portions of which they had not fully paid, and as a consequence, these lands, as well as all others of this class, reverted to the Government. The general market was in New Orleans, whither goods were transported in flat boats built especially for this pupose. This com merce, though small and poorly repaid, was the main avenue of trade, and did much for the slow prosperity prevalent. The few banks in the State found their bills at a discount abroad, and gradu ally becoming drained of their specie, either closed business or failed, the major part of them adopt ing the latter course. The steamboat began to be an important factor in the river navigation of the West about this period. The first boat to descend the Ohio was the Orleans, built at Plttsburg in 1812, and in December of that year, while the fortunes of war hung over the land, she made her first trip from the Iron City to New Orleans, being just twelve days on the way. The second, built by Samuel Smith, was called the Comet, and made a trip as far south as Louisville, in the summer of 1813. The third, the Vesuvius, was built by Fulton, and went to New Orleans in 1814. The fourth, built by Daniel French at Brownsville, Penn., made two trips to Louisville in the summer of 1814. The next vessel, the \u00c6tna, was built by Fulton & Company in 1815. So fast did the business increase, that, four years after, more than forty steamers floated on the Western waters. Improvements in machinery kept pace with the building, until, in 1838, a competent writer stated there were no less than four hundred steamers in the West. Since then, the erection of railways has greatly retarded ship-building, and it is alto gether probable the number has increased but little. The question of canals began to agitate the Western country during the decade succeeding the war. They had been and were being constructed in older countries, and presaged good and prosper ous times. If only the waters of the lakes and the Ohio River could be united by a canal run ning through the midst of the State, thought the people, prosperous cities and towns would arise on its banks, and commerce flow through the land. One of the firmest friends of such improvements was De Witt Clinton, who had been the chief man in forwarding the \" Clinton Canal,\" in New York. He was among the first to advocate the feasibility of a canal connecting Lake Erie and the Ohio River, and, by the success of the New York canals, did much to bring it about. Popular writers of the day all urged the scheme, so that when the Assem bly met, early in December, 1821, the resolution, offered by Micajah T. Williams, of Cincinnati,"], [140, "130 HISTORY OF OHIO. is in the eastern part of Mercer County, and is about nine miles long by from two to four wide. It was formed by raising two walls of earth from ten to thirty feet high, called respectively the east and west embankments ; the first of which is about two miles in length ; the second, about four. These walls, with the elevation of the ground to the north and south, formed a huge basin, to retain the water. The reservoir was commenced in 1837, and finished in 1845, at an expense of several hundred thousand dollars. When first built, dur ing the accumulation of water, much malarial disease prevailed in the surrounding country, owing to the stagnant condition of the water. The citi zens, enraged at what they considered an innova tion of their rights, met, and, during a dark night, tore out a portion of the lower wall, letting the water flow out. The damage cost thousands of dollars to repair. All who participated in the proceedings were liable to a severe imprisonment, but the state of feeling was such, in Mercer County, where the offense was committed, that no jury could be found that would try them, and the affair gradually died out. The canals, so efficacious in their day, were, however, superseded by the railroads rapidly find ing their way into the West. From England, where they were early used in the collieries, the transition to America was easy. The first railroad in the United States was built in the summer of 1826, from the granite quarry belonging to the Bunker Hill Monument Associa tion to the wharf landing, three miles distant. The road was a slight decline from the quarry to the wharf, hence the loaded cars were pro pelled by their own gravity. On their return, when empty, they were drawn up by a single horse. Other roads, or tramways, quickly followed this. They were built at the Pennsylvania coal mines, in South Carolina, at New Orleans, and at Baltimore. Steam motive power was used in 1831 or 1832, first in America on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, and in Charlestown, on a railroad there. To transfer these highways to the West was the question of but a few years' time. The prairies of Illinois and Indiana offered superior inducements to such enterprises, and, early in 1835, they began to be agitated there. In 1838, the first rail was laid in Illinois, at Meredosia, a little town on the Illinois River, on what is now the Wabash Railway. \"The first railroad made in Ohio,\" writes Caleb Atwater, in his \"History of Ohio,\" in 1838, \"was finished in 1836 by the people of Toledo, a town for the appointment of a committee of five mem bers to take into consideration so much of the Governor's me\u00e6age as related to canals, and see if some feasible plan could not be adopted whereby a beginning could be made, was quickly adopted. The report of the committee, advising a survey and examination of routes, met with the approval of the Assembly, and commissioners were ap pointed who were to employ an engineer, examine the country and report on the practicability of a canal between the lakes and the river. The com missioners employed James Geddes, of Onondaga County, N. Y., as an engineer. He arrived in Columbus in June, 1822, and, before eight months, the corps of engineers, under his direction, had examined one route. During the next two sum mers, the examinations continued. A number of routes were examined and surveyed, and one, from Cleveland on the lake, to Portsmouth on the Ohio, was recommended. Another canal, from Cincin nati to Dayton, on the Miami, was determined on, and preparations to commence work made. A Board of Canal Fund Commissioners was created, money was borrowed, and the morning of July 4, 1825, the first shovelful of earth was dug near Newark, with imposing ceremonies, in the presence of De Witt Clinton, Governor of New York, and a mighty concourse of people assembled to witness the auspicious event. Gov. Clinton was escorted all over the State to aid in developing the energy everywhere apparent. The events were important ones in the history of the State, and, though they led to the creation of a vast debt, yet, in the end, the canals were a benefit. The main canal \u2014 the Ohio and Erie Canal \u2014 was not completed till 1832. The Maumee Canal, from Dayton to Cincinnati, was finished in 1834. They cost the State about '$6,000,000. Each of the main canals had branches leading to important towns, where their construction could be made without too much expense. The Miami and Mau mee Canal, from Cincinnati northward along the Miami River to Piqua, thence to the Maumee and on to the lake, was the largest canal made, and, for many years, was one of the most important in the State. It joined the Wabash Canal on the eastern boundary of Indiana, and thereby saved the construction of many miles by joining this great canal from Toledo to Evansville. The largest artificial lake in the world, it is said, was built to supply water to the Miami Canal. It exists yet, though the canal is not much used. It"], [141, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 131 some two years old then, situated near the mouth of Maumee River. The road extends westward in to Michigan and is some thirty miles in length. There is a road about to be made from Cincinnati to Springfield. This road follows the Ohio River up to the Little Miami River, and there turns northwardly up its valley to Xenia, and, passing the Yellow Springs, reaches Springfield. Its length must be about ninety miles. The State will own one-half of the road, individuals and the city of Cincinnati the other half. This road will, no doubt, be extended to Lake Erie, at Sandusky City, within a few short years.\" \" There is a railroad.\" continues Mr. Atwater, \" about to be made from Painesville to the Ohio River. There are many charters for other roads, which will never be made.\" Mr. Atwater notes also, the various turnpikes as well as the famous National road from Baltimore westward, then completed only to the mountains. This latter did as much as any enterprise ever en acted in building up and populating the West. It gave a national thoroughfare, which, for many years, was the principal wagon-way from the At lantic to the Mississippi Valley. The railroad to which Mr. Atwater refers as about to be built from Cincinnati to Springfield, was what was known as the Mad River Railroad. It is commonly conceded to be the first one built in Ohio.* Its history shows that it was chartered March 11, 1836, that work began in 1837; that it was completed and opened for business from Cincinnati to Milford, in December, 1842; to Xe nia, in August, 1845, and to Springfield, in Au gust, 1846, It was laid with strap rails until about 1848, when the present form of rail was adopted. One of the earliest roads in Ohio was what was known as the Sandusky, Mansfield & Newark Rail road. It was chartered at first as the Monroeville & Sandusky City Railroad, March 9, 1835. March 12, 1836, the Mansfield & New Haven road was chartered; the Columbus & Lake Erie, March 12, 1845, and the Huron & Oxford, February 27, 1846. At first it ran only from Sandusky to Monroeville, then from Mansfield to Huron. These * Hon. E D. Mansfield states, in 1873, that the \" first actual piece of railroad laid in Ohio, was made on the Cincinnati & Sandusky Railroad; but, about the same time we have the Little Miami Rail road, which was surveyed in 1836 and 1837. If this, the generally accepted opinion, is correct, then Mr. Atwater's statement as given, is wrong. His history is, however, generally conreded to be correct. Written in 1838, he surely ought to know whereof he was writing, as the railroads were then only in construction ; but few, if any, in operation. two were connected and consolidated, and then ex tended to Newark, and finally, by connections, to Columbus. It is unnecessary to follow closely the history of these improvements through the years succeeding their introduction. At first the State owned a share in nearly all railroads and canals, but finally finding itself in debt about $15,000,000 for such improvements, and learning by its own and neigh bors' experiences, that such policy was detrimental to the best interests of the people, abandoned the plan, and allowed private parties entire control of all such works. After the close of the Mexican war, and the return to solid values in 1 854 or there abouts, the increase of railroads in all parts of Ohio, as well as all parts of the West, was simply marvel ous. At this date there are more than ten thou sand miles of railroads in Ohio, alongside of which stretch innumerable lines of telegraph, a system of swift messages invented by Prof. Morse, and adopted in the United States about 1851. About the time railroad building began to as sume a tangible shape, in 1840, occurred the cele brated political campaign known in history as the \" Hard Cider Campaign.\" The gradual encroach ments of the slave power in the West, its arrogant attitude in the Congress of the United States and in several State legislatures : its forcible seizure of slaves in the free States, and the enactment and attempted enforcement of the \" fugitive slave\" law all tended to awaken in the minds of the Northern. people an antagonism, terminating only in the late war and the abolishment of that hideous system in the United States. The \" Whig Party\" strenuously urged the abridgment or confinement of slavery in the Southern States, and in the contest the party took a most active part, and elected William Henry Harrison President of the United States. As he had been one of the foremost leaders in the war of 1812, a resident of Ohio, and one of its most pop ular citizens, a log cabin and a barrel of cider were adopted as his exponents of popular opinion, as expressive of the rule of the common people repre sented in the cabin and cider, in turn representing their primitive and simple habits of life. He lived but thirty days after his inauguration, dying on the 9th of April, 1841, when John Tyler, the Vice President, succeeded him as Chief Executive of the nation. The building of railroads ; the extension of com merce ; the settlement of all parts of the State ; its growth in commerce, education, religion and"], [142, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 132 population, are the chief events from 1S41 to the Mexican war. Hard times occurred about as often as they do now, preceded by \" flush\" times, when speculation ran rife, the people all infatuated with an insane idea that something could be had for nothing. The bubble burst as often as inflated, ruining many people, but seemingly teaching few lessons. CHAPTER XII. MEXICAN WAR\u2014 CONTINUED GROWTH OF THE STATE\u2014 WAR OF THE REBELLION\u2014 OHIO'S PART IN THE CONFLICT. THE Mexican War grew out of the question of the annexation of Texas, then a province of Mexico, whose territory extended to the Indian Territory on the north, and on up to the Oregon Territory on the Pacific Coast. Texas had been settled largely by Americans, who saw the condi tion of affairs that would inevitably ensue did the country remain under Mexican rule. They first took steps to secede from Mexico, and then asked the aid of America to sustain them, and annex the country to itself. The Whig party and many others opposed this, chiefly on the grounds of the extension of slave territory. But to no avail. The war came on, Mexico was conquered, the war lasting from April 20, 1846, to May 30, 1848. Fifty thousand vol unteers were called for the war by the Congress, and $10,000,000 placed at the disposal of the President, James K. Polk, to sustain the army and prosecute the war. The part that Ohio took in the war may be briefly summed up as follows: She had five vol unteer regiments, five companies in the Fifteenth Infantry, and several independent companies, with her full proportion among the regulars. When war was declared, it was something of a crusade to many ; full of romance to others ; hence, many more were offered than could be received. It was a campaign of romance to some, yet one of reality, ending in death, to many. When the first call for troops came, the First, Second and Third Regiments of infantry responded at once. Alexander Mitchell was made Colonel of the First; John B\". Wellerits Lieutenant Colonel ; and L. Hamer Giddings, of Dayton, its Major. Thomas Hanna, one of the ablest lawyers in Ohio, started with the First as its Major, but, before the regiment left the State, he was made a Brigadier General of Volunteers, and, at the battle of Mon terey, distinguished himself ; and there contracted disease and laid down his life. The regiment's Colonel, who had been wounded at Monterey, came home, removed to Minnesota, and there died. Lieut. Col. Weller went to California after the close of the war. He was United States Senator from that State in the halls of Congress, and, at last, died at New Orleans. The Second Regiment was commanded by Col. George W. Morgan, now of Mount Vernon ; Lieut. Col. William Irwin, of Lancaster, and Maj. Will iam Wall. After the war closed, Irwin settled in Texas, and remained there till he died. Wall lived out his days in Ohio. The regiment was never in active field service, but was a credit to the State. The officers of the Third Regiment were, Col. Samuel R. Curtis; Lieut. Col. G. W. McCook and Maj. John Love. The first two are now dead ; the Major lives in McConnellsville. At the close of the first year of the war, these regiments (First, Second and Third ) were mustered out of service, as their term of enlistment had expired. When the second year of the war began, the call for more troops on the part of the Government induced the Second Ohio Infantry to re-organize, and again enter the service. William Irwin, of the former organization, was chosen Colonel; William Latham, of Columbus, Lieutenant Colonel, and William H. Link, of Circleville, Major. Nearly all of them are now dead. The regular army was increased by eight Ohio companies of infantry, the Third Dragoons, and the Voltigeurs \u2014 light-armed soldiers. In the Fif teenth Regiment of the United States Army, there were five Ohio companies. The others were three from Michigan, and two from Wisconsin. Col. Morgan, of the old Second, was made Colonel of the Fifteenth, and John Howard, of Detroit, an old artillery officer in the regular army, Lieutenant Colonel. Samuel Wood, a captain in the Sixth"], [143, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 133 United States Infantry, was made Major ; but was afterward succeeded by Mill, of Vermont. The Fifteenth was in a number of skirmishes at first, and later in the battles of Contreras, Cherubusco and Chapultepec. At the battle of Cherubusco, the Colonel was severely wounded, and Maj. Mill, with several officers, and a large number of men, killed. For gallant service at Contreras, Col. Mor gan, though only twenty-seven years old, was made a Brevet Brigadier General in the United States Army. Since the war he has delivered a number of addresses in Ohio, on the campaigns in Mex ico.. The survivors of the war are now few. Though seventy-five thousand men from the United States went into that conflict, less than ten thousand now survive. They are now veterans, and as such de light to recount their reminiscences on the fields of Mexico. They are all in the decline of life, and ere a generation passes away, few, if any, will be left. After the war, the continual growth of Ohio, the change in all its relations, necessitated a new organic law. The Constitution of 1852 was the result. It re-affirmed the political principles of the \"ordinance of 1787\" and the Constitution of 1802, and made a few changes necessitated by the advance made iu the interim. It created the office of Lieutenant Governor, fixing the term of service at two years. This Constitution yet stands notwithstanding the prolonged attempt in 1873-74 to create a new one. It is now the organic law of Ohio. From this time on to the opening of the late war, the prosperity of the State received no check. Towns and cities grew ; railroads multiplied ; com merce was extended ; the vacant lands were rapidly filled by settlers, and everything tending to the advancement of the people was well prosecuted. Banks, after much tribulation, had become in a measure somewhat secure, their only and serious drawback being their isolation or the confinement of their circulation to their immediate localities. But signs of a mighty contest were apparent. A contest almost without a parallel iu the annals of history ; a contest between freedom and slavery ; between wrong and right ; a contest that could only end in defeat to the wrong. The Republican party came into existence at the close of President Pierce's term, in 1855. Its object then was, prin cipally, the restriction of the slave power ; ultimately its extinction. One of the chief exponents and sup porters of this growing party iu Ohio, was Salmon P. Chase ; one who never faltered nor lost faith ; and who was at the helm of State; in the halls of Con gress; chief of one the most important bureaus of the Government, and, finally, Chief Justice of the United States. When war came, after the election of Abraham Lincoln by the Republican party, Ohio was one of the first to answer to the call for troops. Mr. Chase, while Governor, had re-organized the militia on a sensible basis, and rescued it from the ignominy into which it had fallen. When Mr. Lincoln asked for seventy-five thousand men, Ohio's quota was thirteen regiments. The various chaotic regiments and militia troops in the State did not exceed 1,500 men. The call was issued April 15, 1861 ; by the 18th, two regiments were organized iu Columbus, whither these companies had gathered; before sunrise of the 19th the first and second regiments were on their way to Wash ington City. The President had only asked for thirteen regiments; thirty were gathering; the Government, not yet fully comprehending the nature of the rebellion, refused the surplus troops, but Gov. Dennison was authorized to put ten additional regiments in the field, as a defensive measure, and was also authorized to act on the defensive as well as on the offensive. The immense extent of southern border made this necessary, as all the It lyal people iu West Virginia and Ken tucky asked for help. In the limits of this history, it is impossible to trace all the steps Ohio took in the war. One of her most talented sons, now at the head of one of the greatest newspapers of the world, says, regard ing the action of the people and their Legislature : \"In one part of the nation there existed a grad ual growth of sentiment against the Union, ending in open hostility against its integrity and its Con stitutional law; on the other side stood a resolute, and determined people, though divided in minor matters, firmly united on the question of national supremacy. The people of Ohio stood squarely on this side. Before this her people had been di vided up to the hour when \u2014 \" ' That fierce and sudden flash across the rugged black- ness broke. And, with a voice that shook the land, the guns of Sum- ter spoke; ********* And whereso'er the summons came, there rose the angry din. As when, upon a rocky coast, a stormy tide sets in.' \" All waverings then ceased among the people and in the Ohio Legislature. The Union must be"], [144, "134 HISTORY OF OHIO. nobly met the first shock, and enacted the first measures of law for war. Laboring under difficul ties inseparable from a condition so unexpected, and in the performance of duties so novel, it may be historically stated that for patriotism, zeal and ability, the Ohio Legislature of 1861 was the equal of any of its successors ; while in that exu berance of patriotism which obliterated party lines and united all in a common effort to meet the threatened integrity of the United States as a nation, it surpassed them both. \" The war was fought, the slave power forever destroyed, and under additional amendments toiler organic law, the United States wiped the stain of human slavery from her escutcheon, liberating over four million human beings, nineteen-twentieths of whom were native-born residents. \" When Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House, Ohio had two hundred regiments of all arms in the National service. In the course of the war, she had furnished two hundred and thirty regiments, besides twenty-six independent batteries of artillery, five independent companies of cavalry, several companies of sharpshooters, large parts of five regiments credited to the West Virginia con tingent, two regiments credited to the Kentucky contingent, two transferred to the United States colored troops, and a large proportion of the rank and file of the Fifty-fourth and Sixty-fifth Massa chusetts Regiments, also colored men. Of these or ganizations, twenty-three were infantry regiments furnished on the first call of the President, an ex cess of nearly one-half over the State's quota ; one hundred and ninety-one were infantry regiments, furnished on subsequent calls of the President \u2014 one hundred and seventeen for three years, twenty seven for one year, two for six months, two for three months, and forty-two for one hundred days. Thirteen were cavalry, and three artillery for three years. Of these three-years troops, over twenty thousand re-enlisted, as veterans, at the end of their long term of service, to fight till the war would end.\" As original members of these organizations, Ohio furnished to the National service the magnificent army of 310,654 actual soldiers, omitting from the above number all those who paid commuta tion money, veteran enlistments, and citizens who enlisted as soldiers or sailors in other States. The count is made from the reports of the Provost Marshal General to the War Department. Penn sylvania gave not quite 28,000 more, while Illinois fell 48,000 behind; Indiana, 116,000 less; preserved. The white heat of patriotism and fe alty to the flag that had been victorious in three wars, and had never met but temporary defeat then melted all parties, and dissolved all hesitation, and, April 18, 1861, by a unanimous vote of ninety-nine Representatives in its favor, there was passed a bill appropriating $500,000 to carry into effect the requisition of the President, to protect the National Government, of which sum $450,000 were to purchase arms and equipments for the troops required by that requisition as- the quota of Ohio, and $50,000 as an extraordinary contingent fund for the Governor. The commissioners of the State Sinking Funti were authorized, by the same bill, to borrow this money, on the 6 per cent bonds of the State, and to issue for the same certificates, freeing such bonds from taxation. Then followed other such legislation that declared the property of volunteers free from execution for debt during their term of service; that declared any resident of the State, who gave aid and comfort to the enemies of the Union, guilty of treason against the State, to be punished by imprisonment at hard labor for life; and, as it had become already evi dent that thousands of militia, beyond Ohio's quota of the President's call, would volunteer, the Legislature, adopting the sagacious suggestion of Gov. Dennison, resolved that all excess of volunteers should be retained and paid for service, under direction of the Governor. Thereupon a bill was passed, authorizing the acceptance of volunteers to form ten regiments, and providing $500,000 for their arms and equipments, and $1,500,000 more to be disbursed for troops in case of an in vasion of the State. Then other legislation was enacted, looking to and providing against the ship ment from or through the State of arms or mu nitions of war, to States either assuming to be neutral or in open rebellion ; organizing the whole body of the State militia; providing suitable offi cers for duty on the staff of the Governor ; re quiring contracts for subsistence of volunteers to be let to the lowest bidder, and authorizing the appointment of additional general officers. \" Before the adjournment of that Legislature, the Speaker of the House had resigned to take command of one of the regiments then about to start for Washington City ; two leading Senators had been appointed Brigadier Generals, and many, in fact nearly all, of the other members of both houses had, in one capacity or another, entered the military service. It was the first war legislature ever elected in Ohio, and, under sudden pressure,"], [145, "137 HISTORY OF OHIO. Kentucky, 235,000, and Massachusetts, 164,000. Thus Ohio more than maintained, in the National army, the rank among her sisters which her popu- lation supported. Ohio furnished more troops than the President ever required of her ; and at the end of the war, with more than a thousand men in the camp of the State who were never mustered into the service, she still had a credit on the rolls of the War Department for 4,332 soldiers, beyond the aggregate of all quotas ever assigned to her; and, besides all these, 6,479 citizens had, in lieu of personal service, paid the commutation ; while In- diana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and New York were all from five to one hundred thousand behind their quotas. So ably, through all those years of trial and death, did she keep the promise of the memorable dispatch from her first war Governor : \" If Kentucky refuses to fill her quota, Ohio will fill it for her.\" \"Of these troops 11,237 were killed or mor- tally wounded in action, and of these 6,563 were left dead on the field of battle. They fought on well-nigh every battle-field of the war. Within forty-eight hours after the first call was made for troops, two regiments were on the way to Wash- ington. An Ohio brigade covered the retreat from the first battle of Bull Run. Ohio troops formed the bulk of army that saved to the Union the territory afterward erected into West Virginia ; the bulk of the army that kept Kentucky from seceding ; a large part of the army that captured Fort Donelson and Island No. 10 ; a great part of the army that from Stone River and Chickamauga, and Mission Ridge and Atlanta, swept to the sea and captured Fort McAllister, and north through the Carolinas to Virginia.\" When Sherman started on his famous march to the sea, some one said to President Lincoln, \"They will never get through; they will all be captured, and the Union will be lost.\" \" It is impossible,\" replied the President ; \"it cannot be done. There is a mighty sight of sight in one hundred thou sand Western men.\" Ohio troops fought at Pea Ridge. They charged at Wagner. They helped redeem North Carolina. They were in the sieges of Vicksburg, Charleston, Mobile and Richmond. At Pittsburg Landing, at Antietam, Gettysburg and Corinth, in the Wilderness, at Five Forks, before Nashville and Appomattox Court House ; \" their bones, reposing on the fields they won and in the graves they fill, are a perpetual pledge that no flag shall ever wave over their graves but that flag they died to maintain.\" Ohio's soil gave birth to, or furnished, a Grant, a Sherman, a Sheridan, a McPherson, a Rosecrans, a McClellan, a McDowell, a Mitchell, a Gilmore, a Hazen,a Sill, a Stanley, a Steadman,and others \u2014 all but one, children ofthecountry, reared at West Point for such emergencies. Ohio's war record shows one General, one Lieutenant General, twenty Major Generals, twenty-seven Brevet Major Generals, and thirty Brigadier Generals, and one \"hundred and fifty Brevet Brigadier Generals. Her three war Governors were William Dennison, David Todd, and John Brough. She furnished, at the same time, one Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton, and one Secretary of the Treasury, Salmon P. Chase. Her Senators were Benjamin F. Wade and John Sherman. At least three out of five of Ohio's able-bodied men stood in the line of battle. On the head stone of one of these soldiers, who gave his life for the country, and who now lies in a National Cemetery, is inscribed these words : \" We charge the living to preserve that Constitution we have died to defend.\" The close of the war and return of peace brought a period of fictitious values on the country, occa- sioned by the immense amount of currency afloat. Property rose to unheard-of values, and everything with it. Ere long, however, the decline came, and with it \" hard times.\" The climax broke over the country in 1873, and for awhile it seemed as if the country was on the verge of ruin. People found again, as preceding generations had found, that real value was the only basis of true prosper- ity, and gradually began to work to the fact. The Government established the specie basis by gradual means, and on the 1st day of January, 1879, began to redeem its outstanding obligations in coin. The effect was felt everywhere. Busi- ness of all kinds sprang anew into life. A feeling of confidence grew as the times went on, and now, on the threshold of the year 1880, the State is en tering on an era of steadfast prosperity ; one which has a sure and certain foundation. Nearly four years have elaped since the great Centennial Exhibition was held in Philadelphia ; an exhibition that brought from every State in the Union the best products of her soil, factories, and all industries. In that exhibit Ohio made an ex cellent display. Her stone, iron, coal, cereals, woods and everything pertaining to her welfare were all represented. Ohio, occupying the middle ground of the Union, was expected to show to foreign na tions what the valleys of the Mississippi and Ohio"], [146, "138 HISTORY OF OHIO. could produce. The State nobly stood the test and ranked foremost among all others. Her cen tennial building was among the first completed and among the neatest and best on the grounds. During the summer, the Centennial Commission extended invitations to the Governors of the several States to appoint an orator and name a day for his delivery of an address on the history, progress and resources of his State. Gov. Hayes named the Hon. Edward D. Mansfield for this purpose, and August 9th, that gentleman delivered an address so valuable for the matter which it contains, that we here give a synopsis of it. CHAPTER XIII. OHIO IN THE CENTENNIAL\u2014 ADDRESS OF EDWARD D. MANSFIELD, LL. D., PHILADELPHIA, AUGUST 9, 187G. ONE hundred years ago, the whole territory, from the Alleghany to the Rocky Mountains was a wilderness, inhabited only by wild beasts and Indians. The Jesuit and Moravian missionaries were the only white men who had penetrated the wilderness or beheld its mighty lakes and rivers. While the thirteen old colonies were declaring their independence, the thirteen new States, which now lie in the western interior, had no existence, and gave no sign of the future. The solitude of nature was unbroken by the steps of civilization. The wisest statesman had not contemplated the probability of the coming States, and the boldest patriot did not dream that this interior wilderness should soon contain a greater population than the thirteen old States, with all the added growth of one hundred years. Ten years after that, the old States had ceded their Western lands to the General Government, and the Congress of the United States had passed the ordinance of 1785, for the survey of the pub lic territory, and, in 1787, the celebrated ordinance which organized the Northwestern Territory, and dedicated it to freedom and intelligence. Fifteen years after that, and more than a quarter of a century after the Declaration of Independ ence, the State of Ohio was admitted into the Union, being the seventeenth which accepted the Constitution of the United States. It has since grown up to be great, populous and prosperous under the influence of those ordinances. At her admittance, in 1803, the tide of emigration had begun to flow over the Alleghanies into the Valley of the Mississippi, and, although no steamboat, no railroad then existed, nor even a stage coach helped the immigrant, yet the wooden \"ark\" on the Ohio, and the heavy wagon, slowly winding over the mountains, bore these tens of thousands to the wilds of Kentucky and the plains of Ohio. In the spring of 1788 \u2014 the first year of settlements four thousand five hundred persons passed the mouth of the Muskingum in three months, and the tide continued to pour on for half a century in a widening stream, mingled with all the races of Europe and America, until now, in the hundredth yearof America'sindependence, thefive Statesof the Northwestern Territory, in the wilderness of 1776, contain ten millions of people, enjoying all the blessings which peace and prosperity, freedom and Christianity, can confer upon any people. Of these five States, born under the ordinance of 1787, Ohio is the first, oldest, and, in many things, the greatest. In some things it is the greatest State in the Union. Let us, then, attempt, in the briefest terms, to draw an outline portrait of this great and remark able commonwealth. Let us observe its physical aspects. Ohio is just one-sixth part of the Northwestern Territory \u2014 10,000 square miles. It lies between Lake Erie and the Ohio River, having 200 miles of navigable waters, on one side flowing into the Atlantic Ocean, and on the other into the Gulf of Mexico. Through the lakes, its vessels touch on 6,000 miles of interior coast, and, through the Mississippi, on 36,000 miles of river coast; so that a citizen of Ohio may pursue his navigation through 42,000 miles, all in his own country, and all within naviga ble reach of his own State. He who has circumnavi gated the globe, has gone but little more than half the distance which the citizen of Ohio finds within his natural reach in this vast interior. Looking upon the surface of this State, we find no mountains, no barren sands, no marshy wastes, no lava-covered plains, but one broad, compact"], [147, "139 HISTORY OF OHIO. body of arable land, intersected with rivers and streams and running waters, while the beautiful Ohio flows tranquilly by its side. More than three times the surface of Belgium, and one-third of the whole of Italy, it has more natural resources in proportion than either, and is capable of ultimately supporting a larger population than any equal sur face in Europe. Looking from this great arable surface, where upon the very hills the grass and the forest trees now grow exuberant and abundant, we find that underneath this surface, and easily accessible, lie 10,000 square miles of coal, and 4,000 square miles of iron \u2014 coal and iron enough to supply the basis of manufacture for a world ! All this vast deposit of metal and fuel does not in terrupt or take from that arable surface at all. There you may find in one place the same machine bringing up coal and salt water from below, while the wheat and the corn grow upon the surface above. The immense masses of coal, iron, salt and freestone deposited below have not in any way diminished the fertility aud production of the soil. It has been said by some writer that the char acter of a people is shaped or modified by the character of the country in which they live. If the people of Switzerland have acquired a certain air of liberty and independence from the rugged mountains around which they live; if the people of Southern Italy, or beautiful France, have ac quired a tone of ease and politeness from their mild and genial clime, so the people of Ohio, placed amidst such a wealth of nature, in the tem perate zone, should show the best fruits of peace ful industry and the best culture of Christian civilization. Have they done so? Have their own labor and arts and culture come up to the ad vantages of their natural situation? Let us exam ine this growth and their product. The first settlement of Ohio was made by a colony from New England, at the mouth of the Muskingum. It was literally a remnant of the officers of the Revolution. Of this colony no praise of the historian can be as competent, or as strong, as the language of Washington. He says, in answer to inquiries addressed to him: \"No col ony in America was ever settled under such favor able auspices as that which has just commenced at the Muskingum. Information, prosperity and strength will be its characteristics. I know many of the settlers personally, and there never were men better calculated to promote the welfare of such a community,\" and he adds that if he were a young man, he knows no country in which he would sooner settle than in this Western region.\" This colony, left alone for a time, made its own government and nailed its laws to a tree in the vil lage, an early indication of that law-abiding and peaceful spirit which has since made Ohio a just and well-ordered community. The subsequent settlements on the Miami and Scioto were made by citizens of New Jersey and Virginia, and it is cer tainly remarkable that among all the early immi gration, there were no ignorant people. In the language of Washington, they came with \"infor mation,\" qualified to promote the welfare of the community. Soon after the settlement on the Muskingum and the Miami, the great wave of migration flowed on to the plains and valleys of Ohio and Ken tucky. Kentucky had been settled earlier, but the main body of emigrants in subsequent years went into Ohio, influenced partly by the great ordinance of 1787, securing freedom and schools forever, and partly by the greater security of titles under the survey and guarantee of the United States Government. Soon the new State grew up, with a rapidity which, until then, was unknown in the history of civilization. On the Muskingum, where the buffalo had roamed; on the Scioto, where the Shawanees had built their towns ; on the Miami, where the great chiefs of the Miamis had reigned ; on the plains of San dusky, yet red with the blood of the white man ; on the Maumee, where Wayne, by the victory of the \" Fallen Timbers,\" had broken the power of the Indian confederacy \u2014 the emigrants from the old States and from Europe came in to cultivate the fields, to build up towns, and to rear the insti tutions of Christian civilization, until the single State of Ohio is greater in numbers, wealth, and education, than was the whole American Union when the Declaration of Independence was made. Let us now look at the statistics of this growth and magnitude, as they are exhibited in the cen sus of the United States. Taking intervals of twenty years, Ohio had: In 1810, 230,760; in 1830, 937,903; in 1850, 1,980,329; in 1870, 2,665,260. Add to this the increase of population in the last six years, and Ohio now has, in round numbers, 3,000,000 of people \u2014 half a million more than the thirteen States in 1776 ; and her cities and towns have to-day six times the population of all the cities of America one hund red years ago. This State is now the third in numbers and wealth, and the first in some of those institutions which mark the progress of"], [148, "140 HISTORY OF OHIO. mankind. That a small part of the wilderness of 1776 should be more populous than the whole Union was then, and that it should have made a social and moral advance greater than that of any nation in the same time, must be regarded as one of the most startling and instructive facts which attend this year of commemoration. If such has been the social growth of Ohio, let us look at its physical development ; this is best expressed by the aggregate productions of the labor and arts of a people applied to the earth. In the census statistics of the United States these are expressed in the aggregate results of agriculture, mining, manufact ures, and commerce. Let us simplify these statis tics, by comparing the aggregate and ratios as between several States, and between Ohio and some countries of Europe. The aggregate amount of grain and potatoes \u2014 ' farinaceous food, produced in Ohio in 1870 was 134,938,413 bushels, and in 1874, there were 157, 323,597 bushels, being the largest aggregate amount raised in any State but one, Illinois, and larger per square mile than Illinois or any other State in the country. The promises of nature were thus vindicated by the labor of man ; and the industry of Ohio has fulfilled its whole duty to the sustenance of the country and the world. She has raised more grain than ten of the old States together, and more than half raised by Great Britain or by France. I have not the recent statistics of Europe, but McGregor, in his statistics of nations for 1832 \u2014 a period of pro found peace \u2014 gives the following ratios for the leading countries of Europe : Great Britain, area 120,324 miles; amount of grain, 262,500,000 bushels; rate per square mile, 2,190 to 1; Austria \u2014 area 258,603 miles ; amount of grain, 366,800,000 bushels; rate per square mile, 1,422 to 1; France \u2014 area 215,858 miles; amount of grain, 233,847,300 bushels ; rate per square mile, 1,080 to 1. The State of Ohio \u2014 area per square miles, 40,000 ; amount of grain, 150,000,000 bushels ; rate per square mile, 3,750. Combining the great countries of Great Britain, Austria, and France, we find that they had 594,785 square miles and produced 863,147 ,300 bushels of grain, which was, at the time these statistics were taken, 1 ,450 bushels per square mile, and ten bushels to each one of the population. Ohio, on the other hand, had 3,750 bushels per square mile, and fifty bushels to each one of the population ; that is, there was five times as much grain raised in Ohio, in proportion to the people, as in these great countries of Europe. As letters make words, and words express ideas, so these dry figures of statistics express facts, and these facts make the whole history of civilization. Let us now look at the statistics of domestic animals. These are always indicative of the state of society in regard to the physical comforts. The horse must furnish domestic conveyances ; the cattle must furnish the products of the dairy, as well as meat, and the sheep must furnish wool. Let us see how Ohio compares with other States and with Europe : In 1870, Ohio had 8,818,000 domestic animals ; Illinois, 6,925,000 ; New York, 5,283,000; Pennsylvania, 4,493,000; and other States less. The proportion to population in these States was, in Ohio, to each person, 3.3 ; Illinois, 2.7; New York, 1.2; Pennsylvania, 1.2. Let us now see the proportion of domestic ani- mals in Europe. The results given by McGregor's statistics are : In Great Britain, to each person, 2.44; Russia, 2.00; France, 1.50 ; Prussia, 1.02; Austria, 1.00. It will be seen that the proportion in Great Britain is only two-thirds that of Ohio; in France, only one-half; and in Austria and Prussia only one-third. It may be said that, in the course of civilization, the number of animals diminishes as the density of population increases ; and, therefore, this result might have been ex- pected in the old countries of Europe. But this does not apply to Russia or Germany, still less to other States in this country. Russia in Europe has not more than half the density of population now in Ohio. Austria and Prussia have less than 150 to the square mile. The whole of the north of Europe has not so dense a population as the State of Ohio, still less have the States of Illinois and Missouri, west of Ohio. Then, therefore, Ohio showing a larger proportion of domestic ani mals than the north of Europe, or States west of her, with a population not so dense, we see at once there must be other causes to produce such a phenomenon. Looking to some of the incidental results of this vast agricultural production, we see that the United States exports to Europe immense amounts of grain and provisions ; and that there is manufact ured in this country an immense amount of woolen goods. Then, taking these statistics of the raw material, we find that Ohio produces one-fifth of all the wool ; one-seventh of all the cheese ; one eighth of all the corn, and one-tenth of all the wheat ; and yet Ohio has but a fourteenth part of the population, and one-eightieth part of the sur face of this country."], [149, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 141 Let us take another \u2014 a commercial view of this matter. We have seen that Ohio raises five times as much grain per square mile as is raised per square mile in the empires of Great Britain, France and Austria, taken together. After making allow ance for the differences of living, in the working classes of this country, at least two-thirds of the food and grain of Ohio are a surplus beyond the necessities of life, and, therefore, so much in the commercial balance of exports. This corresponds with the fact, that, in the shape of grain, meat, liquors and dairy products, this vast surplus is con stantly moved to the Atlantic States and to Europe. The money value of this exported product is equal to $100,000,000 per annum, and to a solid capital of $1,500,000,000, aster all the sustenance of the people has been taken out of the annual crop. We are speaking of agriculture alone. We are speaking of a State which began its career more than a quarter of a century after the Declaration of Independence was made. And now, it may be asked, what is the real cause of this extraordinary result, which, without saying anything invidious of other States, we may safely say has never been surpassed in any country? We have already stated, two of the advantages possessed by Ohio. The first is that it is a compact, unbroken body of arable land, surrounded and intersected by water courses, equal to all the demands of commerce and navigation. Next, that it was secured forever to freedom and intelligence by the ordinance of 1787. The intelligence of its future people was secured by immense grants of public lands for the purpose of education ; but neither the blessings of nature, nor the wisdom of laws, could obtain such results without the continuous labor of an intelligent people. Such it had, and we have only to take the testimony of Washington, already quoted, and the statistical results I have given, to prove that no people has exhibited more steady industry, nor has any people directed their labor with more in telligence. Aster the agricultural capacity and production of a country, its most important physical feature is its mineral products; its capacity for coal and iron, the two great elements of material civiliza tion. If we were to take away from Great Britain her capacity to produce coal in such vast quanti ties, we should reduce her to a third-rate position, no longer numbered among the great nations of the earth. Coal has smelted her iron, run her steam engines, and is the basis of her manufactures. But when we compare the coal fields of Great Britain with those of this country, they are insig nificant. The coal fields of all Europe are small compared with those of the central United States. The coal district of Durham and Northumberland, in England, is only 880 square miles. There are other districts of smaller extent, making in the whole probably one-half the extent of that in Ohio. The English coal-beds are represented as more important, in reference to extent, on account of their thickness. There is a small coal district in Lancashire, where the workable coal-beds are in all 150 feet in thickness. But this involves, as is well known, the necessity of going to immense depths and incurring immense expense. On the other hand, the workable coal-beds of Ohio are near the surface, and some of them require no ex cavating, except that of the horizontal lead from the mine to the river or the railroad. In one county of Ohio there are three beds of twelve, six and four feet each, within fifty feet of the surface. At some of the mines having the best coal, the lead from the mines is nearly horizontal, and just high enough to dump the coal into the railroad cars. These coals are of all qualities, from that adapted to the domestic fire to the very best qual ity for smelting or manufacturing iron. Recollect ing these facts, let us try to get an idea of the coal district of Ohio. The bituminous coal region de escending the western slopes of the Alleghanies, occupies large portions of Western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee. I suppose that this coal field is not less than fifty thousand square miles, exclusive of Western Mary land and the southern terminations of that field in Georgia and Alabama. Of this vast field of coal, exceeding anything found in Europe, about one fifth part lies in Ohio. Prof. Blather, in his report on the geology of the State (first Geologi cal Report of the State) says: \" The coal-measures within Ohio occupy a space of about one hundred and eighty miles in length by eighty in breadth at the widest part, with an area of about ten thousand square miles, extending along the Ohio from Trumbull County in the north to near the mouth of the Scioto in the south. The regularity in the dip, and the moderate incli nation of the strata, afford facilities to the mines not known to those of most other countries, espe cially Great Britain, where the strata in which the coal is imbedded have been broken and thrown out of place since its deposit, occasioning many slips and faults, and causing much labor and expense in again recovering the bed. In Ohio there is very"], [150, "142 HISTORY OF OHIO. little difficulty of this kind, the faults being small and seldom found.\" Now, taking into consideration these geological facts, let us look at the extent of the Ohio coal field. It occupies, wholly or in part, thirty-six counties, including, geographically, 14,000 square miles ; but leaving out fractions, and reducing the Ohio coal field within its narrowest limits, it is 10,000 square miles in extent, lies near the surface, and has on an average twenty feet thickness of work able coal-beds. Let us compare this with the coal mines of Durham and Northumberland (England), the largest and best coal mines there. That coal district is estimated at 850 square miles, twelve feet thick, and is calculated to contain 9,000,000, 000 tons of coal. The coal field of Ohio is twelve times larger and one-third thicker. Estimated by that standard, the coal field of Ohio contains 180, 000,000,000 tons of coal. Marketed at only $2 per ton, this coal is worth $360,000,000,000, or, in other words, ten times as much as the whole valuation of the United States at the present time. But we need not undertake to estimate either its quantity or value. It is enough to say that it is a quantity which we can scarcely imagine, which is tenfold that of England, and which is enough to supply the entire continent for ages to come. After coal, iron is beyond doubt the most val uable mineral product of a State. As the mate rial of manufacture, it is the most important. What are called the \" precious metals \" are not to be compared with it as an element of industry or profit. But since no manufactures can be success fully carried on without fuel, coal becomes the first material element of the arts. Iron is unquestion ably the next. Ohio has an iron district extending from the mouth of the Scioto River to some point north of the Mahoning River, in Trumbull County. The whole length is nearly two hundred miles, and the breadth twenty miles, making, as near as we can ascertain, 4,000 square miles. The iron in this dis trict is of various qualities, and is manufactured largely into bars and castings. In this iron dis trict are one hundred furnaces, forty-four rolling mills, and fifteen rail-mills, being the largest num ber of either in any State in the Union, except only Pennsylvania. Although only the seventeenth State in its admis sion, I find that, by the census statistics of 1870, it is the third State in the production of iron and iron manufactures. Already, and within the life of one man, this State begins to show what must in future time be the vast results of coal and iron, applied to the arts and manufactures. In the year 1874, there were 420,000 tons of pig iron produced in Ohio, which is larger than the prod uct of any State, except Pennsylvania. The product and the manufacture of iron in Ohio have increased so rapidly, and the basis for increase is so great, that we may not doubt that Ohio will continue to be the greatest producer of iron and iron fabrics, except only Pennsylvania. At Cincinnati, the iron manufacture of the Ohio Valley is concentrating, and at Cleveland the ores of Lake Superior are being smelted. After coal and iron, we may place salt among the necessaries of life. In connection with the coal region west of the Alleghanies, there lies in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio, a large space of country underlaid by the salt rock, which already produces immense amounts of salt. Of this, Ohio has its full proportion. In a large section of the southeastern portion of the State, salt is produced without any known limitation. At Pomeroy and other points, the salt rock lies about one thousand feet below the surface, but salt water is brought easily to the surface by the steam engine. There, the salt rock, the coal seam, and the noble sandstone lie in successive strata, while the green corn and the yellow wheat bloom on the surface above. The State of Ohio produced, in 1874, 3,500,000 bushels of salt, being one-fifth of all produced in the United States. The salt section of Ohio is exceeded only by that of Syracuse, New York, and of Saginaw, Michigan. There is no definite limit to the underlying salt rock of Ohio, and, therefore, the production will be proportioned only to the extent of the demand. Having now considered the resources and the products of the soil and the mines of Ohio, we may properly ask how far the people have employed their resources in the increase of art and manu facture. We have two modes of comparison, the rate of increase within the State, and the ratio they bear to other States. The aggregate value of the products of manufacture, exclusive of mining, in the last three censuses were : in 1850, $62,692,000; in 1860, $121,691,000; in 1870, $269,713,000. The ratio of increase was over 100 per cent in each ten years, a rate far beyond that of the in crease of population, and much beyond the ratio of increase in the whole country. In 1850, the man ufactures of Ohio were one-sixteenth part of the aggregate in the country ; in 1860, one-fifteenth"], [151, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 143 part; in 1870, one-twelfth part. In addition to this, we find, from the returns of Cincinnati and Cleveland, that the value of the manufactured prod ucts of Ohio in 1875, must have reached $400, 000,000, and, by reference to the census tables, it will be seen that the ratio of increase exceeded that of the great manufacturing States of New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut. Of all the States admitted into the Union prior to Ohio, Pennsylvania alone has kept pace in the progress of manufacture. Some little reference to the manufacture of leading articles may throw some light on the cause of this. In the production of agricultural machinery and implements, Ohio is the first State ; in animal and vegetable oils and in pig iron, the second; in cast iron and in tobacco, the third ; in salt, in machinery and in leather, the fourth. These facts show how largely the resources of coal, iron and agriculture have entered into the manufactures of the State. This great advance in the manufactures of Ohio, when we consider that this State is, relatively to its surface, the first agricultural State in the country, leads to the inevitable inference that its people are remarkably industrious. When, on forty thousand square miles of surface, three mill ions of people raise one hundred and fifty million bushels of grain, and produce manufactures to the amount of $269,000,000 (which is fifty bushels of breadstuff to each man, woman and child, and $133 of manufacture), it will be difficult to find any community surpassing such results. It is a testimony, not only to the State of Ohio, but to the industry, sagacity and energy of the American people. Looking now to the commerce of the State, we have said there are six hundred miles of coast line, which embraces some of the principal internal ports of the Ohio and the lakes, such as Cincinnati, Cleve land, Toledo and Portsmouth, but whose commerce is most wholly inland. Of course, no comparison can be made with the foreign commerce of the ocean ports. On the other hand, it is well known that the inland trade of the country far exceeds that of all its foreign commerce, and that the larg est part of this interior trade is carried on its rivers and lakes. The materials for the vast con sumption of the interior must be conveyed in its vessels, whether of sail or steam, adapted to these waters. Let us take, then, the ship-building, the navigation, and the exchange trades of Ohio, as elements in determining the position of this State in reference to the commerce of the country. At the ports of Cleveland, Toledo, Sandusky and Cin- cinnati, there have been built one thousand sail and steam vessels in the last twenty years, making an average of fifty each year. The number of sail, steam and all kinds of vessels in Ohio is eleven hundred and ninety, which is equal to the number in all the other States in the Ohio Valley and the Upper Mississippi. When we look to the navigable points to which these vessels are destined, we find them on all this vast coast line, which extends from the Gulf of Mexico to the Yellowstone, and from Duluth to the St. Lawrence. Looking again to see the extent of this vast in terior trade which is handled by Ohio alone, we find that the jmports and exports of the principal articles of Cincinnati, amount in value to $500, 000,000; and when we look at the great trade of Cleveland and Toledo, we shall find that the an nual trade of Ohio exceeds $700,000,000. The lines of railroad which connect with its ports, are more than four thousand miles in length, or rather more than one mile in length to each ten square miles of surface. This great amount of railroads is engaged not merely in transporting to the Atlantic and thence to Europe, the immense surplus grain and meat in Ohio, but in carrying the largest part of that greater surplus, which exists in the States west of Ohio, the granary of the West. Ohio holds the gateway of every railroad north of the Ohio, from the Mississippi to the Atlantic, and hence it is that the great transit lines of the coun try pass through Ohio. Let us now turn from the progress of the arts to the progress of ideas ; from material to intellect ual development. It is said that a State consists of men, and history shows that no art or science, wealth or power, will compensate for the want of moral or intellectual stability in the minds of a nation. Hence, it is admitted that the strength and perpetuity of our republic must consist in the intelligence and morality of the people. A re public can last only when the people are enlight ened. This was an axiom with the early legislators of this country. Hence it was that when Vir ginia, Connecticut and the original colonies ceded to the General Government that vast and then un known wilderness which lay west of the Allegha nies, in the valleys of the Ohio and Mississippi, they took care that its future inhabitants should be an educated people. The Constitution was not formed when the celebrated ordinance of 1787 was passed. That ordinance provided that, \" Religion, mor ality, and knowledge being necessary to good"], [152, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 144 government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall be forever en couraged;\" and by the ordinance of 1785 for the survey of public lands in the Northwestern Terri tory, Section 16 in each township, that is, one thirty-sixth part, was reserved for the maintenance of public schools in said townships. As the State of Ohio contained a little more than twenty-five millions of acres, this, together with two special grants of three townships to universities, amounted to the dedication of 740,000 acres of land to the maintenance of schools and colleges. It was a splendid endowment, but it was many years before it became available. It was sixteen years after the passage of this ordinance (in 1803), when Ohio entered the Union, and legislation upon this grant became possible. The Constitution of the State pursued the language of the ordinance, and de clared that \"schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged by legislative provision.\" The Governors of Ohio, in successive messages, urged attention to this subject upon the people ; but the thinness of settlement, making it impossi ble, except in few districts, to collect youth in suf ficient numbers, and impossible to sell or lease lands to advantage, caused the delay of efficient school system for many years. In 1825, however, a general law establishing a school system, and levy ing a tax for its support, was passed. This was again enlarged and increased by new legislation in 1836 and 1846. From that time to this, Ohio has had a broad, liberal and efficient sys tem of public instruction. The taxation for schools, and the number enrolled in them at different pe riods, will best show what has been done. In 1855 the total taxation for school purposes was $2,672,827. The proportion of youth of school able age enrolled was 67 per cent. In 1874 the amount raised by taxation was $7,425,135. The number enrolled of schoolable age was 70 per cent, or 707,943. As the schoolable age extends to twenty-one years, and as there are very few youth in school aster fifteen years of age, it follows that the 70 per cent of schoolable youths enrolled in the pub lic schools must comprehend nearly the whole number between four and fifteen years. It is im portant to observe this fact, because it has been inferred that, as the whole number of youth be tween five and twenty-one have not been enrolled, therefore they are not educated. This is a mistake; nearly all over fifteen years of age have been in the public schools, and all the native youth of the State, and all foreign born, young enough, have had the benefit of the public schools. But in consequence of the large number who have come from other States and from foreign countries, there are still a few who are classed by the census statistics among the \"illiterate;\" the proportion of this class, however, is less in propor tion than in twenty-eight other States, and less in proportion than in Connecticut and Massachusetts, two of the oldest States most noted for popular education. In fact, every youth in Ohio, under twenty-one years of age, may have the benefit of a public education ; and, since the system of graded and high schools has been adopted, may obtain a common knowledge from the alphabet to the classics. The enumerated branches of study in the pub lic schools of Ohio are thirty-four, including mathematics and astronomy, French, German and the classics. Thus the State which was in the heart of the wilderness in 1776, and was not a State until the nineteenth century had begun, now presents to the world, not merely an unrivaled de velopment of material prosperity, but an unsur passed system of popular education. In what is called the higher education, in the colleges and universities, embracing the classics and sciences taught in regular classes, it is the pop ular idea, and one which few dare to question, that we must look to the Eastern States for superiority and excellence ; but that also is becoming an as sumption without proof; a proposition difficult to sustain. The facts in regard to the education of universities and colleges, their faculties, students and course of instruction, are all set forth in the complete statistics of the Bureau of Education for 1874. They show that the State of Ohio had the largest number of such institutions; the largest number of instructors in their faculties, except one State, New York ; and the largest number of stu dents in regular college classes, in proportion to their population, except the two States of Connect icut and Massachusetts. Perhaps, if we look at the statistics of classical students in the colleges, disregarding preparatory and irregular courses, we shall get a more accurate idea of the progress of the higher education in those States which claim the best. In Ohio, 36 colleges, 258 teachers, 2,139 students, proportion, 1 in 124; in Penn sylvania, 27 colleges, 239 teachers, 2,359 students, proportion, 1 in 150; in New York, 26 colleges, 343 teachers, 2,764 students, proportion, 1 in 176; in the six NewEngland States, 17 colleges, 252 teach ers, 3,341 students, proportion, 1 in 105 ; in mi-"], [153, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 145 nois, 24 colleges, 219 teachers, 1,701 students, proportion, 1 in 140. This shows there are more collegiate institutions in Ohio than in all New England ; a greater num ber of college teachers, and only a little smaller ratio of students to the population ; a greater number of such students than either in New York or Pennsyl vania, and, as a broad, general fact, Ohio has made more progress in education than either of the old States which formed the American Union. Such a fact is a higher testimony to the strength and the beneficent influence of the American Government than any which the statistician or the historian can advance. Let us now turn to the moral aspects of the people of Ohio. No human society is found with out its poor and dependent classes, whether made so by the defects of nature, by acts of Providence, or by the accidents of fortune. Since no society is exempt from these classes, it must be judged not so much by the fact of their existence, as by the manner in which it treats them. In the civil ized nations of antiquity, such as Greece and Rome, hospitals, infirmaries, orphan homes, and asylums for the infirm, were unknown. These are the creations of Christianity, and that must be esteemed practically the most Christian State which most practices this Christian beneficence. In Ohio, as in all the States of this country, and of all Christian countries, there is a large number of the infirm and dependent classes; but, although Ohio is the third State in population, she is only the fourteenth in the proportion of dependent classes. The more important point, however, was, how does she treat them? Is there wanting any of all the varied institutions of benevolence? How does she compare with other States and countries in this respect? It is believed that no State or coun try can present a larger proportion of all these institutions which the benevolence of the wise and good have suggested for the alleviation of suffer ing and misfortune, than the State of Ohio. With 3,500 of the insane within her borders, she has five great lunatic asylums, capable of accommodat ing them all. She has asylums for the deaf and dumb, the idiotic, and the blind. She has the best hospitals in the country. She has schools of reform and houses of refuge. She has \" homes \" for the boys and girls, to the number of 800, who are children of soldiers. She has penitentiaries and jails, orphan asylums and infirmaries. In every county there is an infirmary, and in every public institution, except the penitentiary, there is a school. So that the State has used every human means to relieve the> suffering, to instruct the igno rant, and to reform the criminal. There are in the State 80,000 who come under all the various forms of the infirm, the poor, the sick and the criminal, who, in a greater or less degree, make the dependent class. For these the State has made every provision which humanity or justice or intelligence can require. A young State, de veloped in the wilderness, she challenges, without any invidious comparison, both Europe and Amer ica, to show her superior in the development of humanity manifested in the benefaction of public institutions. Intimately connected with public morals and with charitable institutions, is the religion of a people. The people of the United States are a Christian people. The people of Ohio have man ifested their zeal by the erection of churches, of Sunday schools, and of religious institutions. So far as these are outwardly manifested, they are made known by the social statistics of the census. The number of church organizations in the leading States were : In the State of Ohio, 6,488 ; in the State of New York, 5,627 : in the State of Pennsylvania, 5,984 ; in the State of Illinois, 4,298. It thus appears that Ohio had a larger number of churches than any State of the Union. The number of sittings, however, was not quite as large as those in New York and Pennsylvania. The denominations are of all the sects known in this country, about thirty in number, the majority of the whole being Methodists, Presbyterians and Baptists. Long before the American Independ ence, the Moravians had settled on the Mahoning and Tuscarawas Rivers, but only to be destroyed ; and when the peace with Great Britain was made, not a vestige of Christianity remained on the soil of Ohio ; yet we see that within ninety years from that time the State of Ohio was, in the num ber of its churches, the first of this great Union. In the beginning of this address, I said that Ohio was the oldest and first of these great States, carved out of the Northwestern Territory, and that it was in some things the greatest State of the American Union. I have now traced the physi cal, commercial, intellectual and moral features of the State during the seventy-five years of its constitutional history. The result is to establish fully the propositions with which I began. These facts have brought out : 1. That Ohio is, in reference to the square miles of its surface, the first State in agriculture"], [154, "146 HISTORY OF OHIO. of the American Union; this, too, notwithstand ing it has 800,000 in cities and towns, and a large development of capital and products in manu factures. 2. That Ohio has raised more grain per square mile than either France, Austria, or Great Britain. They raised 1,450 bushels per square mile, and 10 bushels to each person. Ohio raised 3,750 bushels per square mile, and 50 bushels to each one of the population ; or, in other words, five times the proportion of grain raised in Europe. 3. Ohio was the first State of th\u00a3 Union in the production of domestic animals, being far in advance of either New York, Pennsylvania or Illi nois. The proportion of domestic animals to each person in Ohio was three and one-third, and in New York and Pennsylvania less than half that. The largest proportion of domestic animals pro duced in Europe was in Great Britain and Russia, neither of which come near that of Ohio. 4. The coal-field of Ohio is vastly greater than that of Great Britain, and we need make no com parison with other States in regard to coal or iron ; for the 10,000 square miles of coal, and 4,000 square miles of iron in Ohio, are enough to supply the whole American continent for ages to come. 5. Neither need we compare the results of commerce and navigation, since, from the ports of Cleveland and Cincinnati, the vessels of Ohio touch on 42,000 miles of coast, and her 5,000 miles of railroad carry her products to every part of the American continent. 6. Notwithstanding the immense proportion and products of agriculture in Ohio, yet she has more than kept pace with New York and New England in the progress of manufactures during the last twenty years. Her coal and iron are pro ducing their legitimate results in making her a great manufacturing State. 7. Ohio is the first State in the Union as to the proportion of youth attending school ; and the States west of the Alleghanies and north of the Ohio have more youth in school, proportionably, than New England and New York. The facts on this subject are so extraordinary that I may be excused for giving them a little in detail. The proportion of youth in Ohio attending school to the population, is 1 in 4.2; in Illinois, 1 in 4.3 ; in Pennsylvania, 1 in 4.8 ; in New York, 1 in 5.2 ; in Connecticut and Massachusetts, 1 in 8.7. These proportions show that it is in the West, and not in the East, that education is now advanc- ing; and it is here that we see the stimulus given by the ordinance of 1787, is working out its great and beneficent results. The land grant for educa tion was a great one, but, at last, its chief effort was in stimulating popular education ; for the State of Ohio has taxed itself tens of millions of dollars beyond the utmost value of the land grant, to found and maintain a system of public education which the world has not surpassed. We have seen that above and beyond all this material and intellectual development, Ohio has provided a vast benefaction of asylums, hospitals, and infirmaries, and special schools for the support and instruction of the dependent classes. There is not within all her borders a single one of the deaf, dumb, and blind, of the poor, sick, and insane, not an orphan or a vagrant, who is not provided for by the broad and generous liberality of the State and her people. A charity which the classic ages knew nothing of, a beneficence which the splendid hierarchies and aristocracies of Europe cannot equal, has been exhibited in this young State, whose name was unknown one hundred years ago, whose people, from Europe to the Atlantic, and from the Atlantic to the Ohio, were, like Adam and Eve, cast out \u2014 \" the world before them where to chooseP Lastly, we see that, although the third in pop ulation, and the seventeenth in admission to the Union, Ohio had, in 1870, 6,400 churches, the largest number in any one State, and numbering among them every form of Christian worship. The people, whose fields were rich with grain, whose mines were boundless in wealth, and whose commerce extended through thousands of miles of lakes and rivers, came here, as they came to New England's rock-bound coast \u2014 \" With freedom to worship God.\" The church and the schoolhouse rose beside the green fields, and the morning bells rang forth to cheerful children going to school, and to a Chris tian people going to the church of God. Let us now look at the possibilities of Ohio in the future development of the American Repub lican Piepublic. The two most populous parts of Europe, because the most food-producing, are the Netherlands and Italy, or, more precisely, Belgium and ancient Lombardy ; to the present time, their population is, in round numbers, three hundred to the square mile. The density of population in England proper is about the same. We may assume, therefore, that three hundred to the square"], [155, "147 HISTORY OF OHIO. mile is, in round numbers, the limit of comfortable subsistence under modern civilization. It is true that modern improvements in agricultural machin ery and fertilization have greatly increased the capacity of production, on a given amount of land, with a given amount of labor. It is true, also, that the old countries of Europe do not possess an equal amount of arable land with Ohio in proportion to the same surface. It would seem, therefore, that the density of population in Ohio might exceed that of any part of Europe. On the other hand, it may be said with truth that the American people will not become so dense as in Europe while they have new lands in the West to occupy. This is true ; but lands such as those in the valley of the Ohio are now becoming scarce in the West, and we think that, with her great capacity for the production of grain on one hand, and of illimitable quantities of coal and iron to manufacture with on the other, that Ohio will, at no remote period, reach nearly the density of Belgium, which will give her 10,000,000 of people. This seems extravagant, but the tide of migration, which flowed so fast to the West, is beginning to ebb, while the manufactures of the interior offer greater inducements. With population comes wealth, the material for education, the development of the arts, advance in all the material elements of civilization, and the still grander advancements in the strength and elevation of the human mind, conquering to itself new realms of \"material and intellectual power, acquiring in the future what we have seen in the past, a wealth of resources unknown and undreamed of when, a hundred years ago, the fathers of the republic declared their independence. I know how easy it is to treat this statement with easy incredulity, but statistics is a certain science ; the elements of civilization are now measured, and we know the progress of the human race as we know that of a cultivated plant. We know the resources of the country, its food-producing capacity, its art processes, its power of education, and the unde fined and illimitable power of the human mind for new inventions and unimagined progress. With this knowledge, it is not difficult nor unsafe to say that the future will produce more, and in a far greater ratio, than the past. The pictured scenes of the prophets have already been more than ful filled, and the visions of beauty and glory, which their imagination failed fully to describe, will be more than realized in the bloom of that garden which republican America will present to the eyes of astonished mankind. Long before another century shall have passed by, the single State of Ohio will present fourfold the population with which the thirteen States began their independence, more wealth than the entire Union now has ; greater universities than any now in the country, and a development of arts and manufacture which the world now knows nothing of. You have seen more than that since the Constitution was adopted, and what right have you to say the future shall not equal the past ? I have aimed, in this address, to give an exact picture of what Ohio is, not more for the sake of Ohio than as a representation of the products which the American Republic has given to the world. A State which began long after the Declaration of Independence, in the then unknown wilderness of North America, presents to-day the fairest example of what a republican govern ment with Christian civilization can do. Look upon this picture and upon those of Assyria, of Greece or Rome, or of Europe in her best estate, and say where is the civilization of the earth which can equal this. Isa Roman citizen could say with pride, \" Civis Romanus sum,\" with far greater pride can you say this day, \"I am an American citizen.\""], [156, "148 HISTORY OF OHIO. CHAPTER XIV. EDUCATION* \u2014 EARLY SCHOOL LAWS \u2014 NOTES \u2014 INSTITUTES AND EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS- SCHOOL SYSTEM \u2014 SCHOOL FUNDS\u2014 COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. WHEN the survey of the Northwest Terri- tory was ordered by Congress, March 20, 1785, it was decreed that every sixteenth section of land should be reserved for the \"maintenance of public schools within each township.\" The ordinance of 1787 \u2014 thanks to the New England Associates \u2014 proclaimed that, \" religion, morality and knowledge being essential to good government, schools and the means of education should forever be encouraged.\" The State Constitution of 1802 declared that \" schools and the means of instruc tion should be encouraged by legislative provision, not inconsistent with the rights of conscience.\" In 1825, through the persevering effortsof Nathan Guilford, Senator from Hamilton County, Ephraim Cutler, Representative from Washington County, and other friends of education, a bill was passed, \" laying the foundation for a general system of common schools.\" This bill provided a tax of one half mill, to be levied by the County Commis sioners for school purposes ; provided for school examiners, and made Township Clerks and County Auditors school officers. In 1829, this county tax was raised to three-fourths of a mill ; in 1834 to one mill, and, in 1836, to one and a half mills. In March, 1837, Samuel Lewis, of Hamilton County , was appointed State Superintendent of Com mon Schools. He was a very energetic worker, trav eling on horseback all over the State, delivering ad dresses and encouraging school officers and teachers. Through his efforts much good was done, and * From the School Commissioners' Reports, principally those of Thomas W. Harvey, A. M. Note I. \u2014 The first school taught iu Ohio, or in the Northwestern Territory, was in 1791. The first teacher was Maj. Austin Tupper, eldestson of Gen. Benjamin Tupper, both Revolutionary officers. The room occupied was the same as that in which the first Court was held, and was situated in the northwest block-housoof the garrison, called the stockade, at Marietta. During the Indian war school was also taught at Fort Harmar, Point Marietta, and at other set tlements. A meeting was held in Marietta, April 29, 1797, to con sider the erection of a school building suitable for the instruction of the youth, and for conducting religious services. Resolutions were adopted which led to the erection of a building called the Muskingum Academy. The building was of frame, forty feet long and twenty-four feet wide, and is yet(1878)Btanding. Thebuilding was twelve feet high, with an arched ceiling. It stood upon a stone foundation, three Bteps from the ground. There were two chimneys and a lobby projection. There was a cellar under the whole build ing. It stood upon a beautiful lot, fronting the Muskingum River, and about sixty feet back from the etreet. Some large trees were many important features engrafted on the school system. He resigned in 1839, when the office was abolished, and its duties imposed on the Secretary of State. The most important adjunct in early education in the State was the college of teachers organized in Cincinnati in 1831. Albert Pickett, Dr. Joseph Ray, Williapi H. McGuffey \u2014 so largely known by his Readers \u2014 and Milo G. Williams, were at its head. Leading men in all parts of the West at- tended its meetings. Their published deliberations did much for the advancement of education among the people. Through the efforts of the college, the first convention held in Ohio for educational purposes was called at Columbus, January 13, 1836. Two years after, in December, the first convention in which the different sections of the State were represented, was held. At both these conventions, all the needs of the schools, both com- mon and higher, were ably and fully discussed, and appeals made to the people for a more cordial support of the law. No successful attempts were made to organize a permanent educational society until December, 1847, when the Ohio State Teach- ers' Association was formed at Akron, Summit County, with Samuel Galloway as President; T. W. Harvey, Recording Secretary; M. D. Leggett, Corresponding Secretary ; William Bowen, Treas- urer, and M. F. Cowdrey, Chairman of the Executive Committee. This Association entered upon its work with commendable earnestness, and has since upon the lot and on the street in front. Across the Btreet was an open common, and beyond that the river. Immediately opposite the door, on entering, was a broad aisle, and, at the end of the aisle, against the wall, was a desk or pulpit. On the right and left of the pulpit, against the wall, and fronting the pulpit, was a row of slips. On each sideof the door, facing the pulpit, were two slips, and, at each end of the room, one slip. These slips were stationary, and were fitted with desks that could be let down, and there were hoxes in the desks for holding books and papers. In the center of the room was an open space, which could be filled with movable seats. The first school was opened here in 1800.\" \u2014 Letter of A. T. Nye. Note 2. \u2014 Another evidence of the character of the New England Associates is the founding of a public library as early as 1796, or before. Another was also established at Bel pre about tbe same time. Abundant evidence proves the existence of these libraries, all tend ing to the fact that the early settlers, though conquering a wilder- ne&s and a Ba\\'age foe, would not allow their mental faculties to lack for food. The character of the books shows that \"solid\" reading predominated."], [157, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 149 never abated its zeal. Semi-annual meetings were at first held, but, since 1858, only annual meetings occur. They are always largely attended, and al ways by the best and most energetic teachers. The Association has given tone to the educational interests of the State, and has done a vast amount of good in popularizing education. In the spring of 1851, Lorin Andrews, then Superintendent of the Massillon school, resigned his place, and be came a common-school missionary. In July, the Association, at Cleveland, made him its agent, and instituted measures to sustain him. He remained zealously at work in this relation until 1853, when he resigned to accept the presidency of Kenyon College, at Gambier. Dr. A. Lord was then chosen general agent and resident editor of the Journal of Education, which positions he filled two years, with eminent ability. The year that Dr. Lord resigned, the ex officio relation of the Secretary of State to the common schools was abolished, and the office of school com missioner again created. H. H. Barney was elected to the place in October, 1853. The office has since been held by Rev. Anson Smyth, elected in 1856, and re-elected in 1859 ; E. E. White, appointed by the Governor, November 11, 1863, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of C. W. H. Cathcart, who was elected in 1862; John A. Norris, in 1865; W. D. Henkle, in 1868; Thomas W. Harvey, in 1871; C. S. Smart, in 1875, and the present incumbent, J. J. Burns, elected in 1878, his term expiring in 1881. The first teachers' institute in Northern Ohio was held at Sandusky, in September, 1845, con ducted by Salem Town, of New York, A. D. Lord and M. F. Cowdrey. The second was held at Char don, Geauga Co., in November of the same year. The first institute in the southern part of the State was held at Cincinnati, in February, 1837; the first in the central part at Newark, in March, 1848. Since then these meetings of teachers have occurred annually, and have been the means of great good in elevating the teacher and the public in educational interests. In 1848, on petition of forty teachers, county commissioners were author ized to pay lecturers from surplus revenue, and the next year^fo appropriate $100 for institute pur poses, upon pledge of teachers to raise half that amount. By the statutes of 1864, applicants for teachers were required to pay 50 cents each as an examination fee. One-third of the amount thus raised was allowed the use of examiners as trav eling expenses, the remainder to be applied to in- stitute instruction. For the year 1871, sixty-eight teachers' institutes were held in the State, at which 308 instructors and lecturers were employed, and 7,158 teachers in attendance. The expense incurred was $16,361.99, of which $10,127.13 was taken from the institute fund; $2,730.34, was contrib uted by members; $680, by county commis sioners, and the balance, $1,371.50, was ob tained from other sources. The last report of the State Commissioners \u2014 1878 \u2014 shows that eighty five county institutes were held in the State, con tinuing in session 748 days; 416 instructors were employed; 11,466 teachers attended; $22,531.47 were received from all sources, and that the ex penses were $19,587.51, or $1.71 per member. There was a balance on hand of $9,460.74 to com mence the next year, just now closed, whose work has been as progressive and thorough as any former year. The State Association now comprises three sections; the general association, the superintend ents' section and the ungraded school section. All have done a good work, and all report progress. The old State Constitution, adopted by a con vention in 1802, was supplemented in 1851 by the present one, under which the General Assem bly, elected under it, met in 1852. Harvey Rice, a Senator from Cuyahoga County, Chairman of Senate Committee on \"Common Schools and School Lands,\" reported a bill the 29th of March, to provide \"for the re-organization, supervision and maintenance of common schools.\" This bill, amended in a few particulars, became a law March 14, 1853. The prominent features of the new law were : The substitution of a State school tax for the county tax ; creation of the office of the State School Commissioner; the creation of a Township Board of Education, consisting of repre sentatives from the subdistricts ; the abolition of rate-bills, making education free to all the youth of the State; the raising of a fund, by a tax of one tenth of a mill yearly, \" for the purpose of fur nishing school libraries and apparatus to all the common schools.\" This \"library tax\" was abol ished in 1860, otherwise the law has remained practically unchanged. School journals, like the popular press, have been a pptent agency in the educational history of the State. As early as 1838, the Ohio School Director was issued by Samuel Lewis, by legisla tive authority, though after six months' continu ance, it ceased for want of support. The same year the Pestalozzian, by E. L. Sawtell and II. K. Smith, of Akron, and the Common School"], [158, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 150 tificates, valid in all parts of the State. Since then, up to January 1, 1879, there have been 188 of these issued. They are considered an excellent test of scholarship and ability, and are very credit able to the holder. The school funds, in 1865, amounted to $3,271, 275.66. They were the proceeds of appropriations of land by Congress for school purposes, upon which the State pays an annual interest of 6 per cent. The funds are known as the Virginia Mili tary School Fund, the proceeds of eighteen quar ter-townships and three sections of land, selected by lot from lands lying in the United States Military Reserve, appropriated for the use of schools in the Virginia Military Reservation ; the United States Military School Fund, the proceeds of one thirty-sixth part of the land in the United States Military District, appropriated \"for the use of schools within the same ;\" the Western Reserve School Fund, the proceeds from fourteen quarter townships, situated in the United States Military District, and 37,758 acres, most of which was lo cated in Defiance, Williams, Paulding, Van Wert and Putnam Counties, appropriated for the use of the schools in the Western Reserve; Section 16, the proceeds from the sixteenth section of each township in that part of the State in which the Indian title was not extinguished in 1803; the Moravian School Fund, the proceeds from one thirty-sixth part of each of three tracts of 4,000 acres situated in Tuscarawas County, orig inally granted by Congress to the Society of United Brethren, and reconveyed by this Society to the United States in 1824. The income of these funds is not distributed by any uniform rule, owing to defects in the granting of the funds. The territo rial divisions designated receive the income in proportion to the whole number of youth therein, while in the remainder of the State, the rent of Section 16, or the interest on the proceeds arising from its sale, is paid to the inhabitants of the originally surveyed townships. In these terri torial divisions, an increase or decrease of popula tion must necessarily increase or diminish the amount each youth is entitled to receive; and the fortunate location or judicious sale of the sixteenth section may entitle one township to receive a large sum, while an adjacent township receives a mere pittance. This inequality of benefit may be good for localities, but it is certainly a detriment to the State at large. There seems to be no legal remedy for it. In addition to the income from the before mentioned funds, a variable revenue is received Advocate, of Cincinnati, were issued. In 1846, the School Journal began to be published by A. D. Lord, of Kirtland. The same year saw the Free School Clarion, by W. Bowen, of Massillon, and the School Friend, by W. B. Smith & Co., of Cincinnati. The next year, W. H. Moore & Co., of Cincinnati, started the Western School Journal. In 1851, the Ohio Teacher, by Thomas Rainey, appeared; the News and Edu cator, in 1863, and the Educational Times, in 1866. In 1850, Dr. Lord's Journal of Educa tion was united with the School Friend, and became the recognized organ of the teachers in Ohio. The Doctor remained its principal editor until 1856, when he was succeeded by Anson Smyth, who edited the journal one year. In 1857, it was edited by John D. Caldwell ; in 1858 and and 1859, by W. T. Coggeshall; in 1860, by Anson Smyth again, when it passed into the hands of E. E. White, who yet controls it. It has an immense circulation among Ohio teachers, and, though competed by other journals, since started, it maintains its place. The school system of the State may be briefly explained as follows: Cities and incorporated vil lages are independent of township and county con trol, in the management of schools, having boards of education and examiners of their own. Some of them are organized for school purposes, under special acts. Each township has a board of edu cation, composed of one member from each sub district. The township clerk is clerk of this board, but has no vote. Each subdistrict has a local board of trustees, which manages its school affairs, subject to the advice and control of the township board. These officers are elected on the first Monday in April, and hold their offices three years. An enumeration of all the youth between the ages of five and twenty-one is made yearly. All public schools are required to be in session at least twenty-four weeks each year. The township clerk reports annually such facts concerning school affairs as the law requires, to the county auditor, who in turn reports to the State Commissioner, who collects these reports in a general report to the Legislature each year. A board of examiners is appointed in each county by the Probate Judge. This bSard has power to grant certificates for a term not exceed ing two years, and good only in the county in which they are executed ; they may be revoked on sufficient cause. In 1864, a State Board of Examiners was created, with power to issue life cer-"], [159, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 151 from certain fines and licenses paid to either county or township treasurers for the use of schools; from the sale of swamp lands ($25,720.07 allotted to the State in 1850), and from personal property escheated to the State. Aside from the funds, a State school tax is fixed by statute. Local taxes vary with the needs of localities, are limited by law, and are contingent on the liberality and public spirit of different com munities. The State contains more than twenty colleges and universities, more than the same number of female seminaries, aud about thirty normal schools and academies. The amount of property invested in these is more than $6,000,000. The Ohio University is the oldest college in the State. In addition to the regular colleges, the State controls the Ohio State University, formerly the Agricultural and Mechanical College, established from the proceeds of the land scrip voted by Con gress to Ohio for such purposes. The amount realized from the sale was nearly $500,000. This is to constitute a permanent fund, the interest only to be used. In addition, the sum of $300,000 was voted by the citizens of Franklin County, in consideration of the location of the college in that county. Of this sum $111,000 was paid for three hundred and fifteen acres of land near the city of Columbus, and $112,000 for a college building, the balance being expended as circumstances re quired, for additional buildings, laboratory, appa ratus, etc. Thorough instruction is given in all branches relating to agriculture and the mechanical arts. Already excellent results are attained. By the provisions ofthe act of March 14, 1853, township boards are made bodies politic and cor porate in law, and are invested with the title, care and custody of all school property belonging to the school district or township. They have control of the central or high schools of their townships ; prescribe rules for the district schools ; may appoint one of their number manager of the schools of the township, and allow him reasonable pay for his services ; determine the text-books to be used ; fix the boundaries of districts and locate schoolhouse sites ; make estimates of the amount of money re quired ; apportion the money among the districts, and are required to make an annual report to the County Auditor, who incorporates the same in his report to the State Commissioner, by whom it reaches the Legislature. Local directors control the subdistricts. They enumerate the children of school age, employ and dismiss teachers, make contracts for building and furnishing schoolhouses, and make all necessary provision for the convenience of the district schools. Practically, the entire management rests with them. CHAPTER XV.

How bowed the woods beneath their sturdy stroke.\" THE majority of the readers of these pages are farmers, hence a resume of agriculture in the State, would not only be appropriate, but valuable as a matter of history. It is the true basis of national prosperity, and, therefore, justly occupies a foremost place. In the year 1S00, the Territory of Ohio con tained a population of 45,365 inhabitants, or a little more than one person to the square mile. At this date, the admission of the Territory into the Union as a State began to be agitated. When the census was made to ascertain the legality of the act, in conformity to the \"Compact of 1787,\" no endeavor was made to asceitain additional statis tics, as now ; hence, the cultivated land was not returned, and no account remains to tell how much existed. In 1805, three years aster the ad mission of the State into the Union, 7,252,856 acres had been purchased from the General Gov ernment. Still no returns of the cultivated lands were made. In 1810, the population of Ohio was 230,760, and the land purchased from the Gov-"], [160, "152 HISTORY OF OHIO. ernment amounted to 9,933,150 acres, of which amount, however, 3,569,314 acres, or more than one-third, was held by non-residents. Of the lands occupied by resident land-owners, there appear to have been 100,968 acres of first-rate, 1,929,600 of second, and 1,538,745 acres of third rate lands. At this period there were very few exports from the farm, loom or shop. The people still needed all they produced to sustain themselves, and were yet in that pioneer period where they were obliged to produce all they wanted, and yet were opening new farms, and bringing the old ones to a productive state. Kentucky, and the country on the Monongahela, lying along the western slopes of the Alleghany Mountains, having been much longer settled, had begun, as early as 1795, to send considerable quan tities of flour, whisky, bacon and tobacco to the lower towns on the Mississippi, at that time in the possession of the Spaniards. At the French set tlements on the Illinois, and at Detroit, were being raised much more than could be used, and these were exporting also large quantities of these materials, as well as peltries and such commodities as their nomadic lives furnished. As the Missis sippi was the natural outlet of the West, any at tempt to impede its free navigation by the various powers at times controlling its outlet, would lead at once to violent outbreaks among the Western settlers, some of whom were aided by unscrupulous persons, who thought to form an independent Western country. Providence seems to have had a watchful eye over all these events, and to have so guided them that the attempts with such objects in view, invariably ended in disgrace to their per petrators. This outlet to the West was thought to be the only one that could carry their produce to market, for none of the Westerners then dreamed of the immense system of railways now covering that part of the Union. As soon as ship-building commenced at. Marietta, in the year 1800, the farmers along the borders of the Ohio and Musk ingum Rivers turned their attention to the culti vation of hemp, in addition to their other crops. Ina few years sufficient was raised, not only to furnish cordage to the ships in the West, but large quan tities were worked up in the various rope-walks and sent to the Atlantic cities. Iron had been discovered, and forges on the Juniata were busy converting that necessary and valued material into implements of industry. By the year 1805, two ships, seven brigs and three schooners had been built and rigged by the citizens of Marietta. Their construction gave a fresh impetus to agriculture, as by means of them the surplus products could be carried away to a foreign market, where, if it did not bring money, it could be exchanged for merchandise equally valuable. Captain David Devoll was one of the earliest of Ohio's shipwrights. He settled on the fertile Muskingum bottom, about five miles above Marietta, soon after the Indian war. Here he built a \"floating mill,\" for making flour, and, in 1801, a ship of two hundred and fifty tons, called the Muskingum, and the brig Eliza Greene, of one hundred and fifty tons. In 1804, he built a schooner on his own account, and in the spring of the next year, it was finished and loaded for a voyage down the Mississippi. It was small, only of seventy tons burden, of a light draft, and intended to run on the lakes east of New Orleans. In shape and model, it fully sustained its name, Nonpa reil. Its complement of sails, small at first, was completed when it arrived in New Orleans. It had a large cabin to accommodate passengers, was well and finely painted, and sat gracefully on the water. Its load was of assorted articles, and shows very well the nature of exports ofthe day. It con sisted of two hundred barrels of flour, fifty barrels of kiln-dried corn meal, four thousand pounds of cheese, six thousand of bacon, one hundred sets of rum puncheon shocks, and a few grindstones. The flour and meal were made at Captain Devoll's floating mill, and the cheese made in Belpre, at that date one of Ohio's most flourishing agricultural dis tricts. The Captain and others carried on boating as well as the circumstances ofthe days permitted, fear ing only the hostility of the Indians, and the duty the Spaniards were liable to levy on boats going down to New Orleans, even if they did not take it into their erratic heads to stop the entire navi gation of the great river by vessels other than their own. By such means, merchandise was car ried on almost entirely until the construction of canals, and even then, until modern times, the flat-boat was the main-stay of the shipper inhabit ing the country adjoining the upper Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Commonly, very little stock was kept beyond what was necessary for the use of the family and to perform the labor on the farm. The Scioto Valley was perhaps the only exception in Ohio to this general condition. Horses were brought by the emigrants from the East and were characteristic of tbat region. In the French settlements in Illi nois and about Detroit, French ponies, marvels of"], [161, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 155 endurance, were chiefly used. They were impractic able in hauling the immense emigrant wagons over the mountains, and hence were comparatively unknown in Ohio. Until 1828, draft horses were chiefly used here, the best strains being brought by the \"Tunkers,\" \" Mennonites,\" and \" Ormish,\" \u2014 three religious sects, whose members were invariably agriculturists. In Stark, Wayne, Holmes, and Richland Counties, as a general thing, they congregated in communities, where the neat ness of their farms, the excellent condition of their stock, and the primitive simplicity of their manners, made them conspicuous. In 1828, the French began to settle in Stark County, where they introduced the stock of horses known as \" Selim,\" \"Florizel,\" \"Post Boy\" and \"Tiinolen.\" These, crossed upon the descents of the Norman and Conestoga, produced an excellent stock of farm horses, now largely used. In the Western Reserve, blooded horses were in troduced as early as 1825. John I. Van Meter brought fine horses into the Scioto Valley in 1815, or thereabouts. Soon aster, fine horses were brought to Steubenville from Virginia and Penn sylvania. In Northern Ohio the stock was more miscellaneous, until the introduction of improved breeds from 1815 to 1835. By the latter date the strains of horses had greatly improved. The same could be said of other parts of the State. Until after 1825, only farm and road horses were required. That year a race-course \u2014 the first in the State \u2014 was established in Cincinnati, shortly followed by others at Chillicothe, Dayton and Ham ilton. From that date the race-horse steadily im proved. Until 1838, however, all race-courses were rather irregular, and, of those named, it is difficult to determine which one has priority of date over the others. To Cincinnati, the prece dence is, however, generally given. In 1838, the Buckeye Course was established in Cincinnati, and before a year had elapsed, it is stated, there were fifteen regular race-courses in Ohio. The effect of these courses was to greatly stimulate the stock of racers, and rather detract from draft and road horses. The organization of companies to import blooded horses has again revived the interest in this class, and now, at annual stock sales, these strains of horses are eagerly sought after by those having occasion to use them. Cattle were brought over the mountains, and, for several years, were kept entirely for domestic uses. By 1805, the country had so far settled that the surplus stock was fattened on corn and fodder, and a drove was driven to Baltimore. The drove was owned by George Renick, of Chillicothe, and the feat was looked upon as one of great im portance. The drove arrived in Baltimore in ex cellent condition. The impetus given hy^ this movement of Mr. Renick stimulated greatly the feeding of cattle, and led to the improvement of the breed, heretofore only of an ordinary kind. Until the advent of railroads and the shipment of cattle thereon, the number of cattle driven to eastern markets from Ohio alone, was estimated at over fifteen thousand annually, whose value was placed at $600,000. Besides this, large numbers were driven from Indiana and Illinois, whose boundless prairies gave free scope to the herding of cattle. Improved breeds, \"Short Horns,\" \"Long Horns\" and others, were introduced into Ohio as early as 1810 and 1815. Since then the stock has been gradually improved and acclimated, until now Ohio produces as fine cattle as any State in the Union. In some localities, especially in the Western Reserve, cheesemaking and dairy interests are the chief occupations of whole neighborhoods, where may be found men who have grown wealthy in this business. Sheep were kept by almost every family, in pio neer times, in order to be supplied with wool for clothing. The wool was carded by hand, spun in the cabin, and frequently dyed and woven as well as shaped into garments there, too. All emigrants brought the best household and farming imple ments their limited means would allow, so also did they bring the best strains of horses, cattle and sheep they could obtain. About the year 1809, Mr. Thomas Rotch, a Quaker, emigrated to Stark County, and brought with him a small flock of Merino sheep. They were good, and a part of them were from the original flock brought over from Spain, in 1801, by Col. Humphrey, United States Minister to that country. He had brought 200 of these sheep, and hoped, in time, to see every part of the United States stocked with Me rinos. In this he partially succeeded only, owing to the prejudice against them. In 1816, Messrs. Wells & Dickenson, who were, for the day, exten sive woolen manufacturers in Steubenville, drove their fine flocks out on 'the Stark County Plains for the summer, and brought them back for the winter. This course was pursued for several years, until farms were prepared, when they were per manently kept in Stark County. This flock was originally derived from the Humphrey importation. The failure of Wells & Dickenson, in 1824, placed"], [162, "156 HISTORY OF OHIO. a good portion of this flock in the hands of Adam Hildebrand, and became the basis of his celebrated flock. Mr. T. S. Humrickhouse, of Coshoeton, in a communication regarding sheep, writes as fol lows: \" The first merinos brought to Ohio were doubt less by Seth Adams, of Zanesville. They were Humphrey's Merinos \u2014 undoubtedly the best ever imported into the United States, by whatever name called. He kept them part of the time in Washington, and afterward in Muskingum County. He had a sort of partnership agency from Gen. Humphrey for keeping and selling them. They were scattered, and, had they been taken care of and appreciated, would have laid a better found ation of flocks in Ohio than any sheep brought into it from that time till 1852. The precise date at which Adams brought them cannot now be as certained; but it was prior to 1813, perhaps as early as 1804.\" \"The first Southdowns,\" continues Mr. Hum rickhouse,\" \" New Leicester, Lincolnshire and Cots wold sheep I ever saw, were brought into Coshoeton County from England by Isaac Maynard, nephew of the famous Sir John, in 1834. There were about ten Southdowns and a trio of each of the other kinds. He was offered $500 for his Lin colnshire ram, in Buffalo, as he passed through, but refused. He was selfish, and unwilling to put them into other hands when he went on a farm, all in the woods, and, in about three years, most of them had perished.\" The raising and improvement of sheep has kept steady tread with the growth of the State, and now Ohio wool is known the world over. In quan tity it is equal to any State in America, while its quality is unequaled. The first stock of hogs brought to Ohio were rather poor, scrawny creatures, and, in a short time, when lest to themselves to pick a livelihood from the beech mast and other nuts in the woods, degenerated into a wild condition, almost akin to their originators. As the country settled, however, they were gathered from their lairs, and, by feed ing them corn, the farmers soon brought them out of their semi-barbarous state. Improved breeds were introduced. The laws for their protection and guarding were made, and now the hog of to day shows what improvement and civilization can do for any wild animal. The chief city of the State has become famous as a slaughtering place; her bacon and sides being known in all the civil ized world. Other domestic animals, mules, asses, etc., have been brought to the State as occasion required. Wherever their use has been demanded, they have been obtained, until the State has her complement of all animals her citizens can use in their daily labors. Most of the early emigrants brought with them young fruit trees or grafts of some favorite variety from the \" old homestead.\" Hence, on the West ern Reserve are to be found chiefly \u2014 especially in old orchards \u2014 New England varieties, while, in the localities immediately south of the Reserve, Penn sylvania and Maryland varieties predominate ; but at Marietta, New England fruits are again found, as well as throughout Southeastern Ohio. One of the oldest of these orchards was on a Mr. Dana's farm, near Cincinnati, on the Ohio River bank. It consisted of five acres, in which apple seeds and seedlings were planted as early as 1790. Part of the old orchard is yet to be seen, though the trees are almost past their usefulness. Peaches, pears, cherries and apples were planted by all the pioneers in their gardens. As soon as the seed produced seedlings, these were transplanted to some hillside, and the orchard, in a few years, was a productive unit in the life of the settler. The first fruit ' brought, was, like everything else of the pioneers, rather inferior, and admitted of much cultivation. Soon steps were taken by the more enterprising settlers to obtain better varieties. Israel Putnam, as early as 1796, returned to the East, partly to get scions of the choicest apples, and, partly, on other business. He obtained quite a quantity of choice apples, of some forty or fifty varieties, and set them out. A portion of them were distrib uted to the settlers who had trees, to ingraft. From these old grafts are yet to be traced some of the best orchards in Ohio. Israel Putnam was one of the most prominent men in early Ohio days. He was always active in promoting the interests of the settlers. Among his earliest efforts, that of improving the fruit may well be mentioned. He and his brother, Aaron W. Putnam, living at Bel pre, opposite Blennerhasset's Island, began the nursery business soon after their arrival in the West. The apples brought by them from their Connecticut home were used to commence the busi ness. These, and the apples obtained from trees planted in their gardens, gave them a beginning. They were the only two men in Ohio engaged in the business till 1817. In early times, in the central part of Ohio, there existed a curious character known as \"Johnny"], [163, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 157 Appleseed.\" His real name was John Chapman. He received his name from his habit of planting, along all the streams in that part of the State, apple-seeds from which sprang many of the old orchards. He did this as a religious duty, think ing it to be his especial mission. He had, it is said, been disappointed in his youth in a love affair, and came West about 1800, and ever after followed his singular life. He was extensively known, was quite harmless, very patient, and did, without doubt, much good. He died in 1847, at the house of a Mr. Worth, near Fort Wayne, Indiana, who had long known him, and often befriended him. He was a minister in the Swed enborgian Church, and, in his own way, a zealous worker. The settlers of the Western Reserve, coming from New England, chiefly from Connecticut, brought all varieties of fruit known in their old homes. These, whether seeds or grafts, were planted in gardens, and as soon as an orchard could be cleared on some favorable hillside, the young trees were transplanted there, and in time an orchard was the result. Much confusion regarding the kinds of fruits thus produced arose, partly from the fact that the trees grown from seeds did not always prove to be of the same qual ity as the seeds. Climate, soil aud surroundings often change the character of such fruits. Many new varieties, unknown to the growers, were the result. The fruit thus produced was often of an inferior growth, and when grafts were brought from the old New England home and grafted into the Ohio trees, an improvement as well as the old home fruit was the result. Aster the orchards in the Reserve began to bear, the fruit was very often taken to the Ohio River for shipment, and thence found its way to the South ern and Eastern seaboard cities. Among the individuals prominent in introducing fruits into the State, were Mr. Dille, of Euclid, Judge Fuller, Judge Whittlesey, and Mr. Lindley. George Hoadiy was also very prominent and ener getic in the matter, and was, perhaps, the first to introduce the pear to any extent. He was one of the most persistent and enthusiastic amateurs in horticulture and pomology iu the West. About the year 1810, Dr. Jared Kirtland, father of Prof. J. P. Kirtland, so favorably known among horticulturists and pomologists, came from Connecticut and settled in Poland, Mahoning County, with his family. This family has done more than any other in the State, perhaps, to advance fruit culture. About the year 1824, Prof. J. P. Kirtland, in connection with his brother, established a nursery at Poland, then in Trumbull County, and brought on from New England above a hundred of their best varieties of apples, cherries, peaches, pears, and smaller fruits, and a year or two aster brought from New Jersey a hundred of the best varieties of that State ; others were ob tained in New York, so that they possessed the larg est and most varied stock in the Western country. These two men gave a great impetus to fruit cult ure in the West, and did more than any others of that day to introduce improved kinds of all fruits in that part of the United States. Another prominent man in this branch of indus try was Mr. Andrew H. Ernst, of Cincinnati. Although not so early a settler as the Kirtlands, he was, like them, an ardent student and propa gator of fine fruits. He introduced more than six hundred varieties of apples and seven hun dred of pears, both native and foreign. His object was to test by actual experience the most. valuable sorts for the diversified soil and climate of the Western country. The name of Nicholas Longworth, also of Cin cinnati, is one of the most extensively known of any in the science .of horticulture and pomology. For more than fifty years he made these his especial delight. Having a large tract of land in the lower part of Cincinnati, he established nurseries, and planted and disseminated every variety of fruits that could be found in the United States \u2014 East or West \u2014 making occasional importations from European countries of such varieties as were thought to be adapted to the Western climate. His success has been variable, governed by the season, and in a measure by his numerous experi ments. His vineyards, cultivated by tenants, gen erally Germans, on the European plan, during the latter years of his experience paid him a hand some revenue. He introduced the famous ( latawba grape, the standard grape of the West. It is stated that Mr. Longworth bears the same relation to vineyard culture that Fulton did to steam navi gation. Others made earlier effort, but he was the first to establish it on a permanent basis. He has also been eminently successful in the cultivation of the strawberry, and was the first to firmly establish it on Western soil. He also brought the Ohio Ever bearing Raspberry into notice in the State, and widely disseminated it throughout the country. Other smaller fruits were brought out to the West like those mentioned. In some cases fruits"], [164, "158 HISTORY OF OHIO. indigenous to the soil were cultivated and improved, and as improved fruits, are known favorably where ever used. In chronology and importance, of all the cereals, corn stands foremost. During the early pioneer period, it was the staple article of food for both man and beast. It could be made into a variety of forms of food, and as such was not only palata ble but highly nutritious and strengthening. It is very difficult to determine whether corn originated in America or in the Old World. Many prominent botanists assert it is a native of Turkey, and originally was known as \" Turkey wheat.\" Still others claimed to have found mention of maize in Chinese writings antedating the Turkish discovery. Grains of maize were found in an Egyptian mum my, which goes to prove to many the cereal was known in Africa since the earliest times. Maize was found in America when first visited by white men, but of its origin Indians could give no ac count. It had always been known among them, and constituted their chief article of vegetable diet. It was cultivated exclusively by their squaws, the men considering it beneath their dignity to engage in any manual labor. It is altogether probable corn was known in the Old World long before the New was discovered. The Arabs or Crusaders probably introduced it into Europe. How it was introduced into America will, in all probability, remain un known. It may have been an indigenous plant, like many others. Its introduction into Ohio dates with the settlement of the whites, especially its cultivation and use as an article of trade. True, the Indians had cultivated it in small quantities ; each lodge a little for itself, but no effort to make of it a national support began until the civilization of the white race became established. From that time on, the increase in crops has grown with the State, and, excepting the great corn States of the West, Ohio produces an amount equal to any State in the Union. The statistical tables printed in agricultural reports show the acres planted, and bushels grown. Figures speak an unanswerable logic. Wheat is probably the next in importance of the cereals in the State. Its origin, like corn, is lost in the mists of antiquity. Its berry was no doubt used as food by the ancients for ages anterior to any historical records. It is often called corn in old writings, and under that name is frequently mentioned in the Bible. \"As far back in the vistas of ages as human records go, we find that wheat has been cultivated, and, with corn, aside from animal food, has formed one of the chief alimentary articles of all nations ; but as the wheat plant has nowhere been found wild, or in a state of nature, the inference has been drawn by men of unquestioned scientific ability, that the original plant from which wheat has been derived was either totally annihilated, or else cul tivation has wrought so great a change, that the original is by no means obvious, or manifest to bot anists.\" It is supposed by many, wheat originated, in Persia. Others affirm it was known and cultivated in Egypt long ere it found its way into Persia. It was certainly grown on the Nile ages ago, and among the tombs are found grains of wheat in a perfectly sound condition, that unquestionably have been buried thousands of years. It may be, however, that wheat was grown in Persia first, and thence found its way into Egypt and Africa, or, vice versa. It grew first in Egypt and Africa and thence crossed into Persia, and from there found its way into India and all parts of Asia. It is also claimed that wheat is indigenous to the island of Sicily, and that from there it spread along the shores of the Mediterranean into Asia Minor and Egypt, and, as communities advanced, it was cultivated, not only to a greater extent, but with greater success. The goddess of agriculture, more especially of grains, who, by the Greeks, was called Demeter, and, by the Romans, Ceres \u2014 hence the name ce reals \u2014 was said to have her home at Enna, a fertile region of that island, thus indicating the source from which the Greeks and Romans derived their Ceralia. Homer mentions wheat and spelt as bread ; also corn and\u00ab barley, and describes his heroes as using them as fodder for their horses, as the people in the South of Europe do at present. Rye was introduced into Greece from Thrace, or by way of Thrace, in the time of Galen. In C\u00e6sar's time the Romans grew a species of wheat enveloped in a husk, like barley, and by them called \"Far.\" During the excavations of Herculaneum and Pompeii, wheat, in an excellent state of preserva tion, was frequently found. Dr. Anson Hart, Superintendent, at one time, of Indian Affairs in Oregon, states that he found numerous patches of wheat and flax growing wild in the Yackemas country, in Upper Oregon. There is but little doubt that both cereals were intro duced into Oregon at an early period by the Hud son Bay, or other fur companies. Wheat was also"], [165, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 159 found by Dr. Boyle, of Columbus, Ohio, growing in a similar state in the Carson Valley. It was, doubtless, brought there by the early Spaniards. In 1530, one of Cortez's slaves found several grains of wheat accidentally mixed with the rice. The careful negro planted the handful of grains, and succeeding years saw a wheat crop in Mexico, which found its way northward, probably into California. Turn where we may, wherever the foot of civil ization has trod, there will we find this wheat plant, which, like a monument, has perpetuated the memory of the event; but nowhere do we find the plant wild. It is the result of cultivation in bygone ages, and has been produced by \"progress ive development.\" It is beyond the limit and province of these pages to discuss the composition of this important cereal ; only its historic properties can be noticed. With the advent of the white men in America, wheat, like corn, came to be one of the staple prod ucts of life. It followed the pioneer over the mountains westward, where, in the rich Missis sippi and Illinois bottoms, it has been cultivated by the French since 1690. When the hardy New Englanders came to the alluvial lands adjoining the Ohio, Muskingum or Miami Rivers, they brought with them this \"staff of life,\" and forth with begau its cultivation. Who sowed the first wheat in Ohio, is a question Mr. A. S. Guthrie answers, in a letter published in the Agricultural Report of 1857, as follows: \" My father, Thomas Guthrie, emigrated to the Northwest Territory in the year 1788, and arrived at the mouth of the Muskingum in July, about three months after Gen. Putnam had arrived with the first pioneers of Ohio. My father brought a bushel of wheat with him from one of the frontier counties of Pennsylvania, which he sowed on a lot of land in Marietta, which he cleared for that purpose, on the second bottom or plain, in the neighborhood of where the Court House now stands.\" Mr. Guthrie's opinion is corroborated by Dr. Samuel P. Hildreth, in his \" Pioneer Settlers of Ohio,\" and is, no doubt, correct. From that date on down through the years of Ohio's growth, the crops of wheat have kept pace with the advance and growth of civilization. The soil is admirably adapted to the growth of this ce real, a large number of varieties being grown, and an excellent quality produced. It is firm in body, and, in many cases, is a successful rival of wheat produced in the great wheat-producing regions of the United States \u2014 Minnesota, and the farther Northwest. Oats, rye, barley, and other grains were also brought to Ohio from the Atlantic Coast, though some of them had been cultivated by the French in Illinois and about Detroit. They were at first used only as food for home consumption, and, until the successful attempts at river and canal naviga- tion were brought about, but little was ever sent to market. Of all the root crops known to man, the potato is probably the most valuable. Next to wheat, it is claimed by many as the staff of life. In some localities, this assumption is undoubtedly true. What would Ireland have done in her fam- ines but for this simple vegetable? The potato is a native of the mountainous districts of tropical and subtropical America, probably from Chili to Mexico ; but there is considerable difficulty in deciding where it is really indigenous, and where it has spread after being introduced by man. Humboldt, the learned savant, doubted if it had ever been found wild, but scholars no less famous, and of late date, have expressed an opposite opinion. In the wild plant, as in all others, the tubers are smaller than in the cultivated. The potato had been cultivated in America, and its tubers used for food, long before the advent of the Europeans. It seems to have been first brought to Europe by the Spaniards, from the neighbor- hood of Quito, in the beginning of the sixteenth century, and spread through Spain, the Netherlands, Burgundy and Italy, cultivated in gardens as an ornament only and not for an article of food. It long received through European countries the same name with the batatas \u2014 sweet potato, which is the plant meant by all English writers down to the seventeenth century. It appears that the potato was brought from Virginia to Ireland by Hawkins, a slave-trader, in 1565, and to England by Sir Francis Drake, twenty years later. It did not at first attract much notice, and not until it was a third time imported from America, in 1623, by Sir Walter Raleigh, did the Europeans make a practical use of it. Even then it was a long time before it was exten- sively cultivated. It is noticed in agricu'tural journals as food for cattle only as late as 1719. Poor people began using it, however, and finding it highly nutritious, the Royal Geographical Society, in 1663, adopted measures for its propagation. About this time it began to be used in Ireland as"], [166, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 160 shares sharpened in Old Testament days, also coulters, which shows, beyond a doubt, that iron pointed plows were then in use. From times mentioned in the Bible, on heathen tombs, and ancient catacombs, the improvement of the plow, like other farming tools, went on, as the race of man grew in intelligence. Extensive manors in the old country required increased means of turning the ground, and, to meet these demands, ingenious mechanics, from time to time, invented improved plows. Strange to say, however, no improvement was ever made by the farmer himself. This is ac counted for in his habits of life, and, too often, the disposition to \"take things as they are.\" When America was settled, the plow had become an im plement capable of turning two or three acres per day. Still, and for many years, and even until lately, the mold-board was entirely wooden, the point only iron. Later developments changed the wood for steel, which now alone is used. Still later, especially in prairie States, riding plows are used. Like all other improvements, they were obliged to combat an obtuse public mind among the ruralists, who surely combat almost every move made to better their condition. In many places in America, wooden plows, straight ax handles, and a stone in one end of the bag, to bal ance the grist in the other, are the rule, and for no other reason in the world are they maintained than the laconic answer: \" My father did so, and why should not I? Am I better than he? \" After the plow comes the harrow, but little changed, save in lightness and beauty. Formerly, a log of wood, or a brush harrow, supplied its place, but in the State of Ohio, the toothed instru ment has nearly always been used. The hoe is lighter made than formerly, and is now made of steel. At first, the common iron hoe, sharpened by the blacksmith, was in constant use. Now, it is rarely seen outside of the South ern States, where it has long been the chief imple ment in agriculture. The various small plows for the cultivation of corn and such other crops as necessitated their use are all the result of modern civilization. Now, their number is large, and, in many places, there are two or more attached to one carriage, whose operator rides. These kinds are much used in the Western States, whose rootless and stoneless soil is admirably adapted to such machinery. When the grain became ripe, implements to cut it were in demand. In ancient times, the sickle food, and from thebeginningoftheeighteenthcent ury, its use has never declined. It is now known in every quarter of the world, and has, by cultiva tion, been greatly improved. The inhabitants of America learned its use from the Indians, who cultivated it and other root crops \u2014 rutabagas, radishes, etc., and taught the whites their value. When the pioneers of Ohio came to its fertile valleys, they brought improved species with them, which by cultiva tion and soil, are now greatly increased, and are among the standard crops of the State. The cucurbitaeeous plants, squashes, etc., were, like the potato and similar root crops, indigenous to America \u2014 others, like the melons, to Asia \u2014 and were among the staple foods of the original inhabitants. The early French missionaries of the West speak of both root crops and cucurbi taeeous plants as in use among the aboriginal inhab itants. \"They are very sweet and wholesome,\" wrote Marquette. Others speak in the same terms, though some of the plants in this order had found their way to these valleys through the Spaniards and others through early Atlantic Coast and Mex ican inhabitants. Their use by the settlers of the West, especially Ohio, is traced to New England, as the first settlers came from that portion of the Union. They grow well in all parts of the State, and by cultivation have been greatly improved in quality and variety. All cucurbitaeeous plants require a rich, porous soil, and by proper atten tion to their cultivation, excellent results can be attained. Probably the earliest and most important imple ment of husbandry known is the plow. Grain, plants and roots will not grow well unless the soil in which they are planted be properly stirred, hence the first requirement was an instrument that would fulfill such conditions. The first implements were rude indeed ; gener ally, stout wooden sticks, drawn through the earth by thongs attached to rude ox-yokes, or fastened to the animal's horns. Such plows were in use among the ancient Egyptians, and may yet be found among uncivilized nations. The Old Testa ment furnishes numerous instances of the use of the plow, while, on the ruins of ancient cities and among the pyramids of Egypt, and on the buried walls of Babylon, and other extinct cities, are rude drawings of this useful implement. As the use of iron became apparent and general, it was util ized for plow-points, where the wood alone would not penetrate the earth. They got their plow-"], [167, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 101 was the only instrument used. It was a short, curved iron, whose inner edge was sharpened and serrated. In its most ancient form, it is doubtful if the edge was but little, if any, serrated. It is mentioned in all ancient works, and in the Bible is frequently referred to. \" Thrust iu the sickle, for the harvest is ripe,\" wrote the sacred New Testament, while the Old chronicles as early as the time of Moses : \"As thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn.\" In more modern times, the handle of the sickle was lengthened, then the blade, which in time led to the scythe. Both are yet in use in many parts of the world. The use of the scythe led some thinking person to add a \" finger \" or two, and to change the shape of the handle. The old cradle was the result. At first it met considerable oppo sition from the laborers, who brought forward the old-time argument of ignorance, that it would cheapen labor. Whether the cradle is a native of America or Europe is not accurately decided; probably of the mother country. It came into common use about 1818, and in a few years had found its way into the wheat-producing regions of the West. Where small crops are raised, the cradle is yet much used. A man can cut from two to four acres per day, hence, it is much cheaper than a reaper, where the crop is small. The mower and reaper are comparatively mod ern inventions. A rude reaping machine is men tioned by Pliny in the first century. It was pushed by an ox through the standing grain. On its front was a sharp edge, which cut the grain. It was, however, impracticable, as it cut only a por tion of the grain, and the peasantry preferred the sickle. Other and later attempts to make reapers do not seem to have been successful, and not till the present century was a machine made that would do the work required. In 1S26, Mr. Bell, of Scotland, constructed a machine'which is yet used in many parts of that country. In America, Mr. Hussey and Mr. McCormick took out patents for reaping machines of superior character in 1833 and 1834. At first the cutters of these machines were various contrivances, but both manufacturers soon adopted a serrated knife, triangular shaped, at tached to a bar, and driven through \" finger guards \" attached to it, by a forward and backward motion. These are the common ones now in use, save that all do not use serrated knives. Since these pioneer machines were introduced into the harvest fields they have been greatly improved and changed. Of late years they have been constructed so as to bind the sheaves, and now a good stout boy, and a team with a \" harvester,\" will do as much as many men could do a few years ago, and with much greater ease. As was expected by the inventors of reapers, they met with a determined resistance from those who in former times made their living by harvest - ing. It was again absurdly argued that they would cheapen labor, and hence were an injury to the laboring man. Indeed, when the first machines were brought into Ohio, many of them were torn to pieces by the ignorant hands. Others left fields in a body when the proprietor brought a reaper to his farm. Like all such fallacies, these, in time, passed away, leaving only their stain. Following the reaper came the thresher. As the country filled with inhabitants, and men in creased their possessions, more rapid means than the old flail or roller method were demanded. At first the grain was trodden out by horses driven over the bundles, which were laid in a circular inclosure. The old flail, the tramping-out by horses, and the cleaning by the sheet, or throwing -the grain up against a current of air, were too slow, and machines were the result of the demand. In Ohio the manufacture of threshers began in 1846, in the southwestern part. Isaac Tobias, who came to Hamilton from Miamisburg that year, com menced building the threshers then in use. They were without the cleaning attachment, and simply hulled the grain. Two years later, he began manufacturing the combined thresher and cleaner, which were then coming into use. He continued in business till 1851. Four years after, the in creased demand for such machines, consequent upon the increased agricultural products, induced the firm of Owens, Lane & Dyer to fit their estab lishment for the manufacture of threshers. They afterward added the manufacture of steam engines to be used in the place of horse power. Since then the manufacture of these machines, as well as that of all other agricultural machinery, has greatly multiplied and improved, until now it seems as though but little room for improvement remains. One of the largest firms engaged in the manufact ure of threshers and their component machinery is located at Mansfield \u2014 the Aultman & Taylor Co. Others are at Massillon, and at other cities in the West. Modern times and modern enterprise have devel oped a marvelous variety of agricultural implements"], [168, "162 HISTORY OF OHIO. \u2014 too many to be mentioned in a volume like this. Under special subjects they will occasionally be found. The farmer's-life, so cheerless in pioneer times, and so full of weary labor, is daily becom ing less laborious, until, if they as a class profit by the advances, they can find a life of ease in farm pursuits, not attainable in any other profession. Now machines do almost all the work. They sow, cultivate, cut, bind, thresh, winnow and carry the grain. They, cut, rake, load, mow and dry the hay. They husk, shell and clean the corn. They cut and split the wood. They do al most all ; until it seems as though the day may come when the farmer can sit in his house and simply guide the affairs of his farm. Any occupation prospers in proportion to the interest taken in it by its members. This interest is always heightened by an exchange of views, hence societies and periodicals exercise an influence at first hardy realized. This feeling among prominent agriculturists led to the formation of agricultural societies, at first by counties, then districts, then by States, and lastly by associations of States. The day may come when a national agricul tural fair may be one of the annual attractions of America. Without noticing the early attempts to found such societies in Europe or America, the narrative will begin with those of Ohio. The first agricul tural society organized in the Buckeye State was the Hamilton County Agricultural Society. Its exact date of organization is not now preserved, but to a certainty it is known that the Society held public exhibitions as a County Society prior to 1823. Previous to that date there were, doubt less, small, private exhibitions held in older local ities, probably at Marietta, but no regular organi zation seems to have been maintained. The Hamilton County Society held its fairs annually, with marked success. Its successor, the present Society, is now one of the largest county societies in the Union. During the legislative session of 1832-33, the subject of agriculture seems to have agitated the minds of the people through their representatives, for the records of that session show the first laws passed for their benefit. The acts of that body seem to have been productive of some good, for, though no records of the number of societies or ganized at that date exist, yet the record shows that \" many societies have been organized in con formity to this act,\" etc. No doubt many societies held fairs from this time, for a greater or less number of years. Agricultural journals* were, at this period, rare in the State, and the subject of agricultural improvement did not receive that at tention from the press it does at this time ; and, for want of public spirit and attention to sustain these fairs, they were gradually discontinued until the new act respecting their organization was passed in 1846. However, records of several county societies of the years between 1832 and 1846 yet exist, showing that in some parts of the State, the interest in these fairs was by no means diminished. The Delaware County Society re ports for the year 1833 \u2014 it was organized in June of that year \u2014 good progress for a beginning, and that much interest was manifested by the citizens of the county. Ross County held its first exhibition in the autumn of that year, and the report of the mana gers is quite cheerful. Nearly all of the exhibited articles were sold at auction, at greatly advanced prices from the current ones of the day. The en try seems to have been free, in an open inclosure, and but little revenue was derived. Little was ex pected, hence no one was disappointed. Washington County reports an excellent cattle show for that year, and a number of premiums awarded to the successful exhibitors. This same year the Ohio Importation Company was organ ized at the Ross County fair. The Company began the next season the importation of fine cattle from England, and, in a few years, did incalculable good in this respect, as well as make considerable money in the enterprise. These societies were re-organized when the law of 1846 went into effect, and, with those that had gone down and the new ones started, gave an im petus to agriculture that to this day is felt. Now every county has a society, while district, State and inter-State societies are annually held; all promotive in their tendency, and all a benefit to every one. The Ohio State Board of Agriculture was organ ized by an act of the Legislature, passed February 27, 1846. Since then various amendments to the organic law have been passed from time to time as \u2666The Western Tiller was published in Cincinnati, in 1826. It was \"miscellaneous,\" but contained many excellent articles on agri culture. The Farmers' Record was published in Cincinnati, in 1831, and continued for several years. The Ohio Farmer was published at Batavia, Clermont County, in 1833, by Hon. Samuel Medary. Tbese were the early agricultural journals, some of which yet survive, though in new names,and under new management. Others have, also, since been added, some of which have an exceedingly large circulation, and are an influence for much good in the State."], [169, "HISTORY OF OHIO. 163 the necessities of the Board and of agriculture in the State demanded. The same day that the act was passed creating the State Board, an act was also passed providing for the erection of county and district societies, under which law, with subsequent amendments, the present county and district agri cultural societies are managed. During the years from 1 846 down to the present time, great improve ments have been made in the manner of conduct ing these societies, resulting in exhibitions unsur passed in any other State. Pomology and horticulture are branches of in dustry so closely allied with agriculture that a brief resume of their operations in Ohio will be eminently adapted to these pages. The early planting and care of fruit in Ohio has already been noticed. Among the earliest pioneers were men of fine tastes, who not only desired to benefit them selves and their country, but who were possessed with a laudable ambition to produce the best fruits and vegetables the State could raise. For this end they studied carefully the topography of the coun try, its soil, climate, and various influences upon such culture, and by careful experiments with fruit and vegetables, produced the excellent varieties now in use. Mention has been made of Mr. Longworth and Mr. Ernst, of Cincinnati ; and Israel and Aaron W. Putnam, on the Muskingum River ; Mr. Dille, Judges Fuller and Whittlesey, Dr. Jared Kirtland and his sons, and others \u2014 all practical enthusiasts in these departments. At first, individual efforts alone, owing to the condition of the country, could be made. As the State filled with settlers, and means of communication became better, a desire for an in terchange of views became apparent, resulting in the establishment of periodicals devoted to these subjects, and societies where different ones could meet and discuss these things. A Horticultural and Pomological Society was organized in Ohio in 1866. Before the organiza tion of State societies, however, several distinct or independent societies existed ; in fact, out of these grew the State Society, which in turn produced good by stimulating the creation of county societies. All these societies, aids to agriculture, have pro gressed as the State developed, and have done much in advancing fine fruit, and a taste for \u00e6sthetic cul ture. In all parts of the West, their influence is seen in better and improved fruit ; its culture and its demand. To-day, Ohio stands in the van of the Western States in agriculture and all its kindred associa tions. It only needs the active energy of her citizens to keep her in this place, advancing as time advances, until the goal of her ambition is reached. CHAPTER XVI. CLIMATOLOGY\u2014 OUTLINE\u2014 VARIATION IN OHIO\u2014 ESTIMATE IN DEGREES\u2014 RAINFALL\u2014 AMOUNT \u2014VARIABILITY. THE climate of Ohio varies about four degrees. Though originally liable to malaria in many districts when first settled, in consequence of a dense vegetation induced by summer heats and rains, it has became very healthful, owing to clear ing away this vegetation, and proper drainage. The State is as favorable in its sanitary char acteristics as any other in its locality. Ohio is re markable for its high productive capacity, almost every thing grown in the temperate climates being within its range. Its extremes of heat and cold are less than almost any other State in or near the same latitude, hence Ohio suffers less from the ex treme dry or wet seasons which affect all adjoining States. These modifications are mainly due to the influence of the Lake Erie waters. These not only modify the heat of summer and the cold of winter, but apparently reduce the profusion of rainfall in summer, and favor moisture in dry pe riods. No finer climate exists, all conditions consid ered, for delicate vegetable growths, than that por tion of Ohio bordering on Lake Erie. This is abundantly attested by the recent extensive devel opment there of grape culture. Mr. Lorin Blodget, author of \"American Clima tology,\" in the agricultural report of 1853, says ; \"A district bordering on the Southern and West ern portions of Lake Erie is more favorable in this respect (grape cultivation) than any other on the Atlantic side of the Rocky Mountains, and it will ultimately prove capable of a very liberal extension of vine culture.\""], [170, "164 HISTORY OF OHIO. Experience has proven Mr. Blodget correct in his theory. Now extensive fields of grapes are everywhere found on the Lake Erie Slope, while other small fruits find a sure footing on its soil. \" Considering the climate of Ohio by isother mal lines and rain shadings, it must be borne in mind,\" says Mr. Blodget, in his description of Ohio's climate, from which these facts are drawn, \" that local influences often require to be considered. At the South, from Cincinnati to Steubenville, the deep river valleys are two degrees warmer than the hilly districts of the same vicinity. The lines are drawn intermediate between the two extremes. Thus, Cincinnati, on the plain, is 2\u00b0 warmer than at the Observatory, and 4\u00b0 warmer for each year than Hillsboro, Highland County \u2014 the one being 500, the other 1,000, feet above sea-level. The immediate valley of the Ohio, from Cincinnati to Gallipolis, is about 75\u00b0 for the summer, and 54\u00b0 for the year; while the adjacent hilly districts, 300 to 500 feet higher, are not above 73\u00b0 and 52\u00b0 respectively. For the summer, generally, the river valleys are 73\u00b0 to 75\u00b0 ; the level and central portions 72\u00b0 to 73\u00b0, and the lake border 70\u00b0 to 72\u00b0. A peculiar mildness of climate belongs to the vicinity of Kelley's Island, Sandusky and Toledo. Here, both winter and summer, the cli mate is 2\u00b0 warmer than on the highland ridge ex tending from Norwalk and Oberlin to Hudson and the northeastern border. This ridge varies from 500 to 750 feet above the lake, or 850 to 1,200 feet above sea level. This high belt has a summer temperature of 70\u00b0, 27\u00b0 for the winter, and 49\u00b0 for the year ; while at Sandusky and Kelley's Island the summer is 72\u00b0, the winter 29\u00b0, and the year 50\u00b0. In the central and eastern parts of the State, the winters are comparatively cold, the average falling to 32\u00b0 over the more level districts, and to 29\u00b0 on the highlands. The Ohio River valley is about 35\u00b0, but the highlands near it fall to 31\u00b0 and 32\u00b0 for the winter.\" As early as 1824, several persons in the State began taking the temperature in their respective localities, for the spring, summer, autumn and win ter, averaging them for the entire year. From time to time, these were gathered and published, inducing others to take a step in the same direction. Not long since, a general table, from about forty local- ities, was gathered and compiled, covering a period of more than a quarter of a century. This table, when averaged, showed an average temperature of 52.4\u00b0, an evenness of temperature not equaled in many bordering States. Very imperfect observations have been made of the amount of rainfall in the State. Until lately, only an individual here and there through out the State took enough interest in this matter to faithfully observe and record the averages of several years in succession. In consequence of this fact, the illustration of that feature of Ohio's climate is less satisfactory than that of the temperature. \"The actual rainfall of different months and years varies greatly,\" says Mr. Blod get. \"There may be more in a month, and, again, the quantity may rise to 12 or 15 inches in a single month. For a year, the variation may be from a minimum of 22 or 25 inches, to a maxi mum of 50 or even 60 inches in the southern part of the State, and 45 to 48 inches along the lake border. The average is a fixed quantity, and, although requiring a period of twenty or twenty five years to fix it absolutely, it is entirely certain and unchangeable when known. On charts, these average quantities are represented by depths of shading. At Cincinnati, the last fifteen years of observation somewhat reduce the average of 48 inches, of former years, to 46 or 47 inches.\" Spring and summer generally give the most rain, there being, in general, 10 to 12 inches in the spring, 10 to 14 inches in the summer, and 8 to 10 inches in the autumn. The winter is the most variable of all the seasons, the southern part of the State having 10 inches, and the northern part 7 inches or less \u2014 an average of 8 or 9 inches. The charts of rainfall, compiled for the State, show a fall of 30 inches on the lake, and 46 inches at the Ohio River. Between these two points, the fall is marked, beginning at the north, 32, 34, 36 and 38 inches, all near the lake. Farther down, in the latitude of Tuscarawas, Monroe and Mercer Counties, the fall is 40 inches, while the south western part is 42 and 44 inches. The clearing away of forests, the drainage of the land, and other causes, have lessened the rain fall, making considerable difference since the days of the aborigines."], [171, ""], [172, ""], [173, "History of Licking County, CHAPTER XVII.

A deep pre-glacial channel from the north en ters the county a little west of the Sandusky branch of the Baltimore & Ohio railroad, extend ing southward to Newark, and is now occupied by the northern branch of Licking river. At New ark it divides ; one branch turning directly to the east, in the valley of Licking river, and one branch extending northwesterly, through what was evi dently, at one period, a broad lake, and in which now flows the south branch of the Licking, with a reversed current to join the main stream at Newark. A smaller channel, coming from near Martins burgh, Knox county, passes through Eden town ship and the valley occupied by the Rocky fork of the Licking, to its junction with the main stream. This channel is marked by debris of adjacent bluffs, and has had less influence upon the topogra phy of the county than the others named. The larger channels are now filled with water washed pebbles, resting, ordinarily, upon the old rocky bed, but in places upon the remains of the original drift clay, covered with alluvium, and sandy ridges marked by a succession of terraces and corresponding water-plains. South and southwest of Newark these water plains expand, covering a large area. Borings for wells indicate that the rock has been here exca vated to a depth corresponding to that of the old channels, and that in the latter part of the glacial epoch a lake of considerable size covered the sur face. These old flood-plains are exceedingly fer tile. The surface above them is divided into four topographical areas. In the district north of the Licking and east of Rocky fork, including the townships of Perry and Fallsbury, are a succession of hills rising to the rocks above the third coal seam, and are separted by the deep and narrow valleys of the streams, which generally have a rock bottom and bluff banks. The slopes of the hills are usually covered with the debris of the local rocks. North of the Lick ing, and between the North fork and Rocky fork, are similar hills in Mary Ann township, rising to a height sufficient to catch the lower coal, and, in Newton township, to the horizon of the carbonif erous conglomerate, which is here mainly repre sented by a stratum of silicious iron ore."], [174, "i66 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. In the southeastern part of the county are hills of like character; the surface diversified in a simi lar manner by a net-work of deep ravines, the channels of recent streams. In the northeastern part of the county is a high, undulating table land, the rocks all Waverly, and in the northern and central part deeply covered with unmodified drift clay. The undisturbed, billowy surface of the original deposit still re mains, except upon the borders of the streams and upon the southern slope, where the clay of the drift has all been carried away, and the evidences of its presence remain only in the pebbles of the streams and occasional erratics of the slopes of the hills. In the southwestern part of the county an irreg ular series of low hills project into the old water plains of the valleys, in part covered with drift, the latter in places extending below the beds of the present streams. The extreme width of Licking county is twenty two and a half miles from north to south, and, in length, thirty miles from east to west. It contains six hundred and fifty-eight square miles, and was originally thickly covered with a great variety of huge forest trees, and a dense and almost impene trable undergrowth of shrubs and bushes. The earth was also thickly clad with a luxuriant growth of indigenous grasses, weeds and trailing vines, with the exception of a very brief period during the winter months. Of prairies, there were few and none contained more than a very limited number of acres. Among the principal of these was the Bowling Green prairie, or rather series of prairies, com mencing about four miles below Newark and ex tending eastward along the Licking bottoms for a mile or more. Here it was that Hughes and Rat liff erected their cabins in 1798, and raised a crop of corn during that and a number of subsequent seasons, and which was the first corn ever raised by white men within the present limits of the county. One mile below Newark, in the valley of the Licking, was another one, or more, on which Isaac and John Stadden raised corn in the year 1800. There were several prairies of smaller extent down the Licking valley. There was a prairie in Washington township, north of St. Louisville, called the Cranberry prai rie, known, also, in early times, as the Warthen prairie. It was large compared with most of Lick ing county prairies, and in portions of it partook more of the character of a swamp than a prairie. One of the most celebrated prairies in the county was situated a little over a mile west of Newark, and was generally known as Cherry Val ley prairie. It was extensively used as a race course by the early settlers a number of years. Ultimately, most of its surface became measurably covered with water, and hence unfitted for tillage or horse-racing. In this condition it remained nearly thirty years, and until drained by ditching, when much of the area composing it became plough land, and most of the remainder good grass land for pasturage. The \"Little Bowling Green\" situated between the National road and the Perry county line, in Bowling Green township, on the waters of the Moxahala, was a small prairie. It was first culti vated in 1802, and was well known by the early settlers. It gave name to the township in which it is situated, organized in 1808. There were several prairies along the southern borders of Union township, one being of consid erable magnitude; also one or two, separated by a narrow belt of timber, at the junction of the Bloody run and Brushy fork, in McKean town ship, called Plum prairie, and sometimes Plum orchard. It was famous for its abundant yield of prairie rattlesnakes. Besides these there were a number of others in different sections of the county, but they were generally of very small size. The county may, therefore, be considered as belonging to the class known as wilderness, or, heavily timbered; the superficial area of prairie bearing too insignificant a proportion to the timbered land to be taken into account. Of swamps there were many, but mostly small. Most of the prairies had the characteristics of swamps as much as of prairies, rendering their correct classification somewhat difficult. Some of the most notable swamps were on the Bowling Green, five miles below Newark, and at several other points in the Licking valley; one a mile north of Newark, on the farm of Captain"], [175, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 167 Archibald Wilson, where he settled in 1806; also the Bloody Run swamp, near the Fairfield county line, as well as others in the same township, and those in the vicinity of the reservoir; besides many others of smaller size; one in the southeastern part of Lima, Wolf swamp in Liberty, and several in the southern portion of Hartford township. Ponds were numerous but not of large size. The Goose pond, two miles northwest of Newark, covering from fifty to sixty acres, was one of the largest. The Deweese ponds in the southern part of Union township; the Log pond a mile north west of Newark; and the famous pond that orna mented the public square of Newark as late as 1830, were among the principal ones. Of lakes, there is but one, so small, however, that it should be called a lakelet. It is situated near the mouth of Lake fork, in Washington town ship, and covers fifty or sixty acres. It abounded in fish, aquatic plants, some am phibious animals, as well as wild geese and ducks, and was the scene in early times of much sport for anglers and hunters. The water is of very considerable depth in places. It is generally known as \"Smoot's lake,\" a gentleman of that name being owner of most of it. If the reservoir may be included in the cate gory of lakes, it makes the second, though only a portion of it is in Licking county. It is located in the southern portion of Licking and Union townships, and in the counties of Fairfield and Perry; and now embraces an area of more than three thousand acres ; probably one-third belong ing to Licking county. Its limits were somewhat extended in 1828 by the construction of the Ohio canal, of which it is a feeder, and made navigable to Thornport from the canal. The depth of water is considerable, and in early times it was regarded as a paradise by the sportsman. Springs are numerous, but there are few of large size. The Big spring upon the farm originally settled by General John Spencer, in Newton town ship, in 1805, is among the most noteworthy. It is made up of the united waters of several springs, and the volume of water was sufficient to propel the machinery of a grist- and saw-mill for many years after the first settlement of the county. It has yielded to the general law, and now dis- charges a reduced quantity of water, no longer furnishing motive power for machinery, although there is still sufficiency of water for that purpose on a more limited scale. Among the large springs are several north of Centerville street, in Granville township; and another, or rather two that form one, on the Welsh hills, being the head or source of the Goose Pond run. The two rise within two feet of each other, and flowing together, make one spring. The one is what is called hard water, and the other soft water, thus presenting the anomalous feature of being hard water on one side and soft water on the other. It is on the farm of William Cramer in Granville township. It had a copious flow of water in early times, and was reckoned among the largest springs of the county. One or two of the largest springs are situated about a mile north of Newark, near the North fork, on the farm first settled by Mr. Jacob Wil son. Of chalybeate or mineral springs, there are none of any note. Of running streams the county is abundantly furnished. Nearly all the waters of Licking county flow into the Muskingum river, by way of the Pataskala or Licking river, and the Wakatomika. The exceptions are that the rains falling upon the southern portions of Hopewell, Bowling Green, Franklin, and Licking townships, run into the Moxahala or Jonathan's creek, which, after passing through a portion of Perry county, empties into the Muskingum three miles below Zanesville; and the rains falling upon the western portions of the townships of Hartford, Monroe, Jersey, Lima, and Etna flow, by way of the Black Lick and Big Walnut creeks into the Scioto river. The South fork of Licking rises in the north west corner of Jersey and runs through Lima, Harrison, Union, Licking and Newark townships, passing, in its meanderings, a short distance into Fairfield county, and unites with the North fork at Newark, the two forming the Licking river. Hog run and Ramp creek are tributaries of the South fork, both entering that stream at nearly the same point in Licking township. The former rises in Franklin township and runs westwardly; and the latter in Harrison township, running easterly through Union township."], [176, "1 68 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. The \"Flint ridge\" is a section of country of a mountainous character, situated principally in Hopewell township, extending entirely across it from east to west. It slopes off into Muskingum county on the east, and on the west into Franklin township, Licking county; making its extreme length from six to eight miles, and its average breadth less than two miles from north to south, not counting the length of the spurs that diverge from both sides of it, into the more level land. It is extensively covered with flints and buhr- stone, the latter being largely used by mill-owners, in pioneer times, as a substitute of the French buhr, for making flour. The Licking narrows, when the pioneers first settled here, was probably one of the most pictur- esque places in Ohio. It was a romantic, gfoomy gorge, about two miles in length through which flowed Licking river. Cliffs of enormous rocks lined the banks and presented a steep front on the south side, of very irregular height, covered with laurel and evergreen trees, and shrubbery or undergrowth peculiar to mountain regions. The north, or left bank of this dark ravine was formed by a line of nearly solid, sandy rocks, generally from fifty to sixty feet high, and varying in position but slightly from perpen- dicular, rising out of the water, which washed their base in many places, and no where left more than a narrow strip of land, of a few feet between this bank and the river. This stream had an average breadth of a hundred feet or more, and the branches of the trees which stood on its banks al- most ran together; indeed in places they inter- locked, carrying the grape-vines, growing on one side, into the branches of the trees which stood on the other, thus giving the Narrows, during the season of full foliage, a dark, gloomy, cavernous appearance. In places on the left bank, this bed of gray sand-rock stood in a position not perpen- dicular, but overhanging the water in a sort of semi-circular form. On the face or front of one of these overhanging rocks had been rudely drawn, probably by Indians, the outlines of various animals, and also the form of a large human hand; hence the name of \"Black Hand Narrows,\" by which the place was known by the early time hunt ers and pioneer settlers. They found on the front The Raccoon or Middle fork, another tributary of the South fork, has its sources in the townships of Hartford and Monroe, and after passing through the townships of St. Albans, Granville and New ark, empties into the South fork half a mile above the junction of the latter with the north fork at Newark. The Otter fork rises in Knox county, passing through Hartford and Bennington into Burlington township, where it, with other small streams from Knox county, flows into the North fork of Licking. Lake fork rises in Bennington and Liberty town ships, and after passing through Burlington town ship, discharges itself into the North fork two miles south of Utica, in Washington township. Clear fork and Brushy fork rise in Liberty town ship, and both find their way into the North fork; the former at Vanattasburgh, and the latter one mile further south, both in Newton township. North fork rises in Knox county, and after flow ing through the townships of Bennington, Bur lington, Washington, Newton and Newark, unites at the city of Newark, with the South fork, the two forming the Licking or Pataskala river, the main stream of the county, which, after passing through Madison and Hanover townships, empties into the Muskingum river at Zanesville. Brushy fork and the Clay Lick are both tribu taries of Licking river. The former has its source in Muskingum, and after winding around through the valleys and rocky, mountainous regions of Flint ridge, passes through Hopewell and Hanover townships, and empties, in the last named town ship, into the Licking. Clay Lick rises in Hope well, and after passing through Franklin empties into the Licking at the township line between Madison and Hanover. Rocky fork heads in Washington township, and after meandering through the deep gorges, pre cipitous banks, abrubt slopes and steep bluffs of Eden, Mary Ann and Hanover townships, empties into the Licking at the head of the \" Licking nar rows\" in Hanover township. Wakatomika rises in Knox county, and after flowing through Fallsbury and Perry townships empties into the Muskingum river at Dresden. In addition to these streams there are many small tributaries, not necessary to mention."], [177, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 169 surface of this projecting rock, some ten or fifteen feet above its base, at the water's edge, the impres sion of a large hand and wrist, the thumb and fingers distended, and being in dimensions about double that of the hand of a common-sized man. It had been chiseled or scratched out, probably with a sharp-pointed, or thin-edged flint wedge or chisel, and the hollowed grooves thus made had become blackened from the action of the atmos phere ; or perhaps the growth of a coat of black moss had given it its color. This curious black hand pointed east, and was destroyed by the blowing away of the rock on which it was inscribed; this much-to-be-regretted act becoming a necessity in the construction of the Ohio canal; the river the whole length of the Narrows being made slack-water, by means of a dam at the lower end. The Black Hand rock was removed to make room for the towpath. This slack-water canal arrangement was effected by means of a lock at the upper end and a dam, as already stated, at the lower. The interest of the Narrows was also increased somewhat by a beauti ful miniature cascade on the left bank of the river, formed by a small gurgling rill which fell over this perpendicular bank of rock, sixty feet in height, into the stream below. The Licking Narrows was a spot abounding in interest to the' pioneers, and was the scene of many an ancient legend \u2014 of wild hunting stories and thrilling, romantic adventures. The scenery in its primitive state, before man laid his heavy destructive hand upon it, was surpassingly grand, gloomy, picturesque and magnificent. Nature here presented such a splendid exhibition of her her works as to command the admiration of all votaries, under whose observation they came. Here, indeed, is one of Nature's master-pieces \u2014 a deeply interesting manifestation of her power. \"The pines bowed over, the stream bent under The cabin cover'd with thatches of palm, Down in a canon so deep, the wonder Was what it could know in its clime but calm. Down in a canon so cleft asunder By sabre-stroke in the young world's prime, It look'd as broken by bolts of thunder, And burst asunder and rent and riven By earthquakes, driven the turbulent time A red cross lifted red hands to heaven.\" The presence of marine shells and other diluvial deposits, together with many other geological in dications, seem to favor the opinion that these Narrows were formed by the waters of the valley to the west, which were believed to have been a lake or sea at some period of remote antiquity, the surface of which was on or above the level of the tops of the banks forming the Narrows, and discharged its surplus waters over them, gradually washing out and deepening the channel as time rolled on, thus ultimately draining the sea or lake, leaving only the stream that now flows through the gorge, as the outlet for the waters that accumulate in the valley above \u2014 a valley extend ing almost to the western limits of the county, and northward, beyond its limits, embracing an area of hundreds of square miles of most fertile and beautiful lands. This may account for the sandy condition of the soil of the larger part of Licking county \u2014 it was once the bed of a lake. At what period of time this lake existed is unknown ; probably many centuries have intervened. Another deeply interesting locality in the topog raphy of the county is the region of the Rocky fork, and especially, of Rain rock in Eden town ship. These localities will receive attention in the township in which they are located."], [178, "CHAPTER XVIII. GEOLOGY.

In some places the proof is clear that the bottom of those lakes was seventy feet below the present surface of the soil. Blue clay is everywhere in this county the lowest drift deposit. It underlies all other drift. Conse quently, wherever it is found, whatever lies above it is drift or earthy material brought from a dis tance. It is believed that the blue clay has its origin in the black shales found in the western part of Licking county, and cropping out on Walnut creek, where it is crossed by the railroad. The decomposing and grinding up of those shales have formed the blue clays. The peat bogs are an interesting feature, and worthy of careful study. The large ones were formerly cedar swamps, and it is probable that some would well repay the experiment of mining for cedar logs. The great peat bog along the North Fork feeder, in the out-lots of Newark, was a cedar swamp, and the logs lie beneath and upon its surface. It is a rare thing to find a peat bog in any country south of latitude forty degrees, and this circumstance makes the geology of this county still more interesting. East and west, moreover, the county is the limit of peat formation, and north and south of the drift. How long these cedar trees have lain buried in the bog may never be known, but each one is a record of the season while it was alive and growing. Within two miles of Newark coal is found, not extensive, but limited in area. The western edge of the great coal fields of Ohio passes through the eastern part of the county. The coal formation ex tends only into the eastern tier of townships, and Search the mysterious recesses of The great walled earth, and find the handiwork Of God. Pile is heaped on pile, and shaped through A million years. Race on race of men, beasts And vegetation, sink down, perish and Are built upon; and countless ages hence, a Race of pigmies, called men, will then, as now, Drag up from hidden depths these other forms, and, Chattering like monkeys, warm themselves by The fire built of the debris of lost and Forgotten ages. And they, too, shall perish, Miserably, to fructify the world. THE geologic record of this county is, for inter- est, second to few regions, if any,- in the United States. The disturbed stratification of the Atlantic States, Missouri and Arkansas abound in interesting facts, but Uiey are disconnected chap ters in the history of creation, while the strata of Licking county furnish an almost unbroken nar rative from the Silurian up to the Tertiary ; and, to complete the panorama of the great past, the arch \u00e6ological remains wonderfully continue the story down to the historic period. The apparently missing chapter between the coal period and the great drift area is supplied to the careful student by the basins in which the drift is deposited. These basins are as serviceable in teaching the student the features of the primeval world as are fossils. From fossils may be learned where plants grew, and animals lived; but those lakes which dotted the face of this country, and were the homes of life in various forms, when the world warmed by internal heat up to more than tropical temperature, are perpetual witnesses of the great and terrific revolutions which have changed the face of nature, and made this modern world so capable of supporting and developing man, \u2014 the crowning work of the Creator. The evidence of the former existence of these 170"], [179, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. i7i in these it is only found to a limited extent.' The field includes a large part of Fallsbury, a small proportion of Perry and Mary Ann; the larger part of Hanover and all of Franklin, Hopewell and Bowling Green townships. It also extends into the southern portion of Madison. In what is called Metcalf's hill there are two or three strata of coal, with intervening strata, abounding in the prints of coal flora; then of marine naida ; then of coal again, with other forms of flora, and finally capped by a lime rock, which seems to be a mere aggregation of sea-shells. Farther east, passing other coal beds, is found a superior article of hydraulic lime, deposited at a different period, from a similar and less valuable material of Flint ridge. The ridge itself is an anomaly in Ohio geology, and its silicious masses were probably deposited by hot or warm water. In mining the cannel coal in its western spur, many proofs of disturbance are found in the level of that formation. The force which elevated it, probably heated the water, saturated with silica in solution, which was precipitated by cooling, and from which came those beautiful quartz crystals so much sought after. In the whole west and north west there are but two formations to study, \u2014 the Silurian and Drift. In the eastern part of the State is the valuable coal formation alone, with neither the Silurian nor the Drift; but Licking county comprises them all. In short, there are in the county all the various geological outcroppings of the strata belonging to the States, with the exception of the cliff and blue limestone. These two make their appearance west of the Scioto river, and extend to the State of Indiana. In the northwestern townships of the county is found the black shale; through the middle of the county north and south, the fine grained or Waverly sandstone; and east of Newark, at the mouth of the Rocky fork, the conglomerate rock appears in great abundance. This rock lies immediately under the coal field. In the coal field there is the carbonaceous shale, the iron ore, the small veins of coal, each alter nately with shale and sandstone. Then comes the limestone where it appears on the top of what is called the McFarland hill, two miles southeast of Newark. Next and above this, and a mile south, is a coarse-grained sandstone, with the beautiful fossil plants of the coal period. To the east of this there is the buhr of silicate of lime; and on Flint ridge is the crystallized quartz. Regarding the geology of Flint ridge, Hon. Isaac Smucker thus writes: \"The geology and geological manifestations of Flint ridge present some features which afford a high degree of interest to the student of nature. As has already appeared, its surface, when first settled, was largely covered with a compact silicious material known as quartz, or in common language, flint rock or buhr-stone. The late Dr. Hildreth, an eminent geologist of Marietta, and member of the first corps of geologists of our State, in his first annual report on the geology of Ohio, made in 1838, observed that the quartz or buhr-stone was found on the surface of the elevation known as the Flint ridge, covering miles of its territory, and that, too, frequently in extensive masses, and that it had been an object of peculiar interest to the aboriginal inhabitants and pioneer settlers, as well as to the then occupants of the ridge, and of the surrounding country, who appreciated and utilized it on account of its commercial value. \"The geologist and mineralogist have found Flint ridge to be a rich field for investigation \u2014 rich in geological strata and in mineral deposits. I have already mentioned the buhr-stone of the surface \u2014 it is also found in liberal quantities beneath the surface. Professor E. B. Andrews, on page 105, of the \"Pre liminary Geological Report of 1869,\" represents it to be a de posit of variable thickness, attaining in places a maximum depth of eight feet. Dr. Hildreth said that sulphate of baryta, crystallized carbonate of lime, and crystals of quartz are al! the mineral substances that have been associated with the buhr stone of the Flint ridge; the first being rare, the second not abundant, but that the last named was found in brilliant druses, with regular faces, in some portions of those deposits. Some of them he characterized as very beautiful, furnishing fine specimens for the cabinet, being occasionally tinged red or brown by some metallic oxyd. The striking similarity, he con tinues, between these crystals and those about the lead mines of Missouri, had led to some expensive, but fruitless, searches for lead and copper ores. Professor E. B. Andrews remarks, in his report of 1869, that it was found difficult to determine the exact stratigrapttical position of the Flint ridge buhr, as it lies upon the top of the ridge, more like a blanket than like a rigid stratum, conforming more or less to the undulating surface of the general top of the ridge, and, therefore, many feet higher at some points than at others. He found the buhr of Flint ridge to be porous and often cracked, and that water had prob ably passed through it, carrying away the soft shale underlying it, and consequently lowering its stratum along its border. \"The late Colonel J. W. Foster, of the geological corps of Ohio, of 1837-39, makes the buhr deposit of the Flint ridge to range in thickness from two to six feet. He subjoins the fol lowing section to show the relation between the buhr and the associated rocks, at a point on the eastern half of the ridge ; and I submit it to give the geological manifestations of the locality :"], [180, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 172 ant, and the quality may be ranked among the best. The fine granite sandstone, called, by Ohio geologists, the Waverly rock, by those of New York, the Chemung, and, in Nova Scotia, the grindstone grit, when properly worked is among the most beau tiful building stones in the United States. The stratum of this rock is about two hundred feet thick in this county, and its su perficial face some twenty miles wide. Those who have exam ined the fine structures of this stone in Cincinnati must admit that no stone equals it as an architectural material. Its sober drab or neutral color, and smooth surface, has a most pleasing effect in a large house or block of buildings. When near the ground, exposed to wetting and drying, freezing and thawing, it does not weather well, and is liable to disintegrate; but when not thus exposed, if free from sulphur, it is one of the most dur able of building rocks. \"The conglomerate, or coarse-grained stone, overlies the fine-grained; is a stratum of one hundred and twenty to two hundred feet thick, and of a superficial width from east to west of some thirty miles. It weathers well, and is a durable building stone; standing all temperatures and seasons, and is a favorite wherever attainable. Small cubes of galena and sulphuret of lead are occasionally found in this rock, but never in workable quantities. These two last named formations are persistent and run regularly from north to south as a line of bearing with a dip to the eastward. \"There are occasional rock formations, like coal beds, that may have a value when properly developed and managed, of no little economical interest. The first worthy of the name is the carbonate of lime. This is found in Madison, Franklin, Hope well, and one or two other townships. The nearest to Newark is on Metcalf 's and Smith's hills, in the two first named town ships. It nowhere produces the best lime, yet it is said to make a strong cement, and may be used as a fertilizer with good effect. \"Secondly, waterlime. This exists in at least two places, viz. : near the opening of the Flint Ridge cannel coal mine, and on the road from Hoskinson's to the National road, which crosses the latter some two miles west of Brownsville. I am not aware that this water-lime has been tested. \"Thirdly, sulphate of pyrites is found in small masses on Flint ridge. \"The fossil remains of the county are not equaled by any equal area in the State. These are nearly all confined to the eastern part of the county. They consist of plants and shells. The ubiquitous seas, with their myriads have rolled over the lands, which, under other conditions, rejoice under the green foliage of prismatic vegetation. Wherever the fine-grained sandstone is found, the shells of marine animals are abundant, and the occasional patches of limestone are full of them; but the coarse-grained sandstone, near many of the coal beds, are marked with beautiful impressions, or casts of plants of the coal period. The coarseness of the material is not favorable for the delicate impressions of the leaves, but the shales associated with the coal, frequently yielded the very finest specimens of the foliage of primitive time. \"The pipe clay so extensively used in the manufacture of stone-ware must not be overlooked. This almost universal as sociate of the coal bed is suggestive of the probability that each earth was a necessary sub-soil of the swamp or marsh in which the coal plants grow. If such was the fact this fine clay sub serves a two-fold economy \u2014 first, giving that valuable fuel to the i. Buhr 4 ft. 2. Shale 10 \" 3. Hornstone 1 4 in. 4. Grey cherty limestone 5 \" 5.

C. Read, of the corps of Ohio geologists, who surveyed Flint ridge, also found a thin vein of coal resting upon a bed of fire-clay, immediately under the flint or buhr, as will appear, by reference to the third volume of Ohio Geology, page 353, where he gives a general section of the rocks exposed in Licking county.\" B. C. Woodward, in a paper read before the Pioneer Association of Licking county, gives the following regarding the geology of the eastern por- tion of the county, taken mostly from a publica- tion by Mr. Dille: \"It would, perhaps, be difficult to find any equal territory containing so practical a summary of geology as Licking county. It embraces so many of the various formations of which that science treats, that whoever would investigate these subjects will find it a most desirable field to explore. In the western borders are found the carboniferous shales, with the sub-carboniferous; fine grains of sandstone and shales, over which lies the drift, composed of the debris of all the older formations from the granite to the recent plutonic, with the spoils of the post-pliocene and intermediate types from the Si- lurian up to the diluvian. The records of all ages during the organic series of the earth's progress, are kept in nature's great vaults in Licking county. \"The mineral resources of the eastern half of Licking county are more in place, and less disturbed by the drift, or covered by it, than the western; though there is scarcely a township in the county that has not been more or less invaded by the Great Flood. \"Wherever the drift extends the soil is improved by its de- posits, but there are some places in which, instead of depositing, it denuded the original earth, and in such case it impoverished rather than fructified the soil. There are some such places in the eastern part of the county. \"The supply of stone for all purposes of building is abund-"], [181, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. i73 world, and secondly, furnishing a material for a valuable manu factured article. The pipe or fine clay in the vicinity of Flint ridge, is a superior article, and with skill in the art, would probably produce an excellent and beautiful pottery. \"As a study, the theorist in geology would do well to consult the broad page of this county before he forms his conclusions. \" Professor Aggasiz, in maintaining his glacial theory, in op position to the iceberg hypothesis, to account for the transpor tation of large masses of rocks and earth from such places, said: ' If icebergs were the floats upon which such burdens were borne, the drift would be found to be stratified, for each succes sive field of icebergs would deposit its load wherever it was stranded, and the next would drop its load over the other, soon, therefore, exhibiting a well defined stratification, which is never the case.' Had he visited Licking county, he would have found facts to overturn his objections. Nothing is more clear than the stratification of the drift in all parts of the county where the drift exists. \"This drift lies unconformably upon the older rocks every where. The older structure is the blue clay, and if it is examined carefully, we may come with a reasonable certainty to the source of this material in the black shales which crop out on Walnut creek, twenty-five miles west of Newark. Pieces of this shale are frequently found in the clay, and we can hardly be mistaken as to its origin. In the clayey earth, overlying the blue clay, the Cliff limestone, in places just west of Columbus, is found in some places abundantly. \"Next in ascent is the blue limestone from the Cincinnati range. And in the upper, or last, is to be found the plutonic, primitive rocks of the great chain of the Rocky mountains, as sociated with the last drift. Small grains of gold are frequently found. A confirmation of this statement as to the stratified drift should be carefully made, as it is of scientific value.\" From the foregoing glance at its geologic wealth, it is obvious that Licking county presents greater facilities for the practical study of this science, and of the causes which have contributed to form the pro lific soil than any other single locality in Ohio. The Flint ridge alone is one of the most interest ing regions of the State, either for the geologist or the antiquarian."], [182, "CHAPTER XIX. FLORA AND FAUNA.

The surface of the country was beautifully di versified by hill and valley; by the rough, moun tainous region of the eastern half of the county, and the level, beautifully undulating lands of the western half, varied by, here and there, a small swamp, pond, prairie, lakelet, spring or running stream \u2014 almost every variety of natural scenery appeared to the eye of the pioneer. Along the streams, on the bottom land, and also on the more level or second bottom lands grew the walnut, butternut, sycamore, hickory, sugar, maple, hackberry, white, black and blue ash, linden, white and red elm, and the beech, which, however, pre vailed principally in the central and western parts of the county; together with the box-elder, red and yellow plum, black-haw, crab-apple, red-bud, dog-wood, iron-wood, American multi-flora, arrow wood, kinnakinnick, June berry, and a few others. These were found in various places on the above described lands. The gum, cucumber and sassafras trees were found on the clay formation, while on the hills, the different varieties of oak abounded, with a small sprinkling of the tulip or yellow poplar, and, in limited numbers, most of the above mentioned as abounding in the level lands. On Flint ridge the chestnut was the prevailing wood. At the Licking Narrows, in the glens of the Rocky fork and on the tall peaks along that stream generally; and on the eastern bank of North fork, as well as on the south side of Licking river, cedar, pine, hemlock, laurel and other ever greens peculiar to mountainous regions, prevailed to a considerable extent. ' ' Full many a flower is born to blush unseen And waste its sweetness on the desert air.\" THE territory of Licking county in its wilder- ness state, presented landscapes of a greatly diversified character, from the comparative tame ness of a commonplace oak forest, without under growth, to that presented by the romantic wildness of such mountain scenery as the rough, almost im passable spurs and buhr-covered steeps of Flint ridge, and the high, rocky bluffs, towering peaks and dark glens of Licking narrows and the Rocky fork. When seventy years or more ago Hughes and Ratliff, the earliest settlers, occupied Licking valley they must have been surprised at the variety and beauty of its vegetable productions. The silence of the primeval woods had until then been un broken; the forest was here in all its native ma jesty and beauty; the gigantic size and venerable antiquity of the trees, the rankness of the weeds, grasses and trailing vines which formed a thick covering for the ground, the luxuriance and va riety of the underbrush, the long vines that reached to the tops of the tallest trees, the para sites that hung in clusters from the loftiest boughs, the brilliancy of the autumnal foliage, the splendor and variety of the vernal flowers, the snowy white ness of the dog-wood blossoms of early spring and the exuberance of the fruits that were maturing during the summer and autumn, were undoubted manifestations of the most vigorous vegetable life, and an encouraging proof of the quality of the soil. The yield of nuts, berries, grapes, plums, and other wild fruits, was immense, and these for years, perhaps centuries, had been dropping and '74"], [183, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. J75 Many of the grape-vines on the bottom lands were of enormous size, approximating in thickness a man's body. These sometimes spread them selves through the branches of half a score or more of the largest trees, completely shutting out the sun-light, and bearing immense quantities of fruit. The huckleberry, confined principally, to the hills, yielded fruit bountifully. Some other berries grew spontaneously, as the strawberry, raspberry, blackberry, dewberry, and, in a few lo calities, the cranberry. The prairie, or cranberry swamp in the eastern part of Washington town ship, and the swamp lands about the reservoir, some seasons yielded the cranberry in great abun dance, which were, even in an early day, an article of traffic, participated in by the Indians as well as the pioneers. The early settlers laid up for use during the winter months, large quantises of these wild fruits, and also chestnuts, hazelnuts, walnuts, butternuts and hickorynuts. Paw-paws and May apples were plenty and were used to a considera ble extent. The ginseng plant abounded in most localities, in early times, and was an article of extensive traffic, both by whites and Indians, for many years after the first settlement of the county. Every merchant bought it. Beeswax, tallow, furs, hides, feathers, coon-skins and whiskey were not more general articles of trade and barter than ginseng. It disappeared as an article of commerce in the county about 1835, and has not since been known. The plant was exhausted. It was wholly of spon taneous growth and never an article of culture. It was a jointed taper root as large as a man's finger, and when dry was of a yellowish white color, with a mucilaginous sweetness of taste, somewhat re sembling licorice, accompanied with a very slight bitterness. It was exported to China, where it was in demand for its real or supposed medicinal virtues. Between the Raccoon and South fork, near their junction, covering an area of a number of square miles, and extending several miles west of New ark, existed, at the first settlement of the country, a grove of wild cherry, doubtless the growth of centuries, which for numbers, size and quality were hardly equalled in any section of the United States. They were thick, tall, of wide-spreading branches, tolerably clear of knots, and generally sound, except those that gave indications of great age. The woodman's axe had been laid upon but few of these splendid trees, when first noticed in 1825; but not long after, their commercial value became known, and when the Ohio canal opened in 1833, they gradually disappeared, being shipped to Cincinnati and converted into lumber for furni ture. But few of these trees now remain to mark the spot where once stood this famous orchard. The concentric circles of many of them indica ted that they were centuries old; fixing the date of their origin in the pre-historic age of the country. Many of them stood on the works of the Mound Builders. When the wave of white settlers first touched the borders of Licking county, a great variety of wild animals contended with the Indian for su premacy. Some of the native animals of this primeval forest had gradually given way to the general westward movement of the white race. The buffalo was gone, probably never to return, at least in any number. A few years after the first settlement, probably about 1803, a small herd, six or eight in number, strayed from their usual haunts further west, and reached a point a short distance east of where Wills creek empties into the Mus kingum. Here for a day or two they were pur sued by the late John Channel, a famous hunter and pioneer, and perhaps by others, but without success so far as Mr. Channel was concerned. This information is given on the authority of Adam Seymour, who was here at that time, and Mr. E. S. Woods, who obtained the information from Mr. Channel himself. This was probably the last sight of wild buffaloes east of the Scioto. The elk, too, was gone when the pioneers came, but the numerous wide-spreading antlers he once carried, were found profusely scattered in the for est, showing conclusively that he had once been here in considerable numbers, and at no remote period ; but no living wild elk was ever discovered here by the pioneers. Panthers were not numerous, but occasionally one was seen or heard, and a few were killed dur ing the first ten or fifteen years after the first settle ment. An Indian, early in 1805, killed one near the mouth of Brushy fork, three miles north of"], [184, "176 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. Newark, which was supposed to have been the mate of one killed in the same year, near his resi dence, one mile north of Newark, by Mr. Jacob Wilson. Panthers disappeared from this section about 1812. Bears were more numerous and remained longer; an occasional straggler being seen at intervals of many years, until 1846, when two were killed by Alpheus Channel. These were, probably, the last seen in the county. Lewis Farmer informed Mr. Isaac Smucker that he killed one in 1 S06, near Granville, that weighed four hundred pounds. Bruin was hard on young domestic animals, pigs particularly, he had a good appetite for, and it was with great difficulty that the pioneers were able to raise their own pork. Wolves were found in great abundance, and long continued to be a great annoyance to the settlers. The legislature encouraged their extermination by laws which authorized the payment of liberal sums for wolf scalps, both old and young. The records of the county commissioners show that large sums were paid the pioneers of the county for wolf scalps; four dollars being the price for full grown and two dollars for those less than full size. They have long since disappeared. Deer were very abundant, and for many years after the first settlement, supplied the pioneers with most of their animal food. The pioneers were mostly hunters, and the chase yielded them much prosit as well as amusement. So numerous were the deer in early times that an hour's hunt was generally sufficient for securing a fine buck or the more palatable doe or fawn. So plenty and tame were they that they were killed frequently with a shotgun charged only with squirrel shot. Gray foxes, raccoons and ground-hogs were plen ty, and hunting them afforded fine sport. The two latter of these are yet found in limited num bers, but the first has, probably, entirely disappeared. Red foxes, catamounts, wild-cats and porcupines, were found in large numbers, but they early dis appeared, except the first named, which may, per haps, even yet, be occasionally found. Rabbits and squirrels, if not here before the settle- ment of the county, came soon after in great numbers, and still remain. They seem to follow rather than precede the settlements. The beaver and otter were here in considerable numbers, and were much sought after by the trap per for their valuable furs. The former has long since disappeared, and the latter is exceedingly scarce, if indeed, any remain. Muskrats were very numerous and have con tinued so, affording much profit to the hunter and trapper. Wild turkeys were also very abundant in pioneer days, and so continued for many years, affording no inconsiderable portion of the food of the early settlers. They were so numerous and tame that they could be procured by the hunter on very short notice. They are yet occasionally found in the woods. Pheasants were not so numerous as the turkey, and have almost wholly disappeared. Wild geese and ducks were plenty around the little lakes and swamps, and along the streams. These are rarely seen at present. Quails are not natives of the wilderness; neither are crows, black-birds, blue-birds nor turtle-doves, but they all became plenty after the settlement of the county, and still remain in moderate quantities. Bees were plenty, and the tables of the pioneers were generally supplied with honey. Cranes, woodcocks, woodpeckers and pigeons were plenty, and yet remain, with the exception of the first named. Birds of prey, such as turkey-buzzards or vul tures, hawks, ravens, owls and eagles, were very numerous, but have been slowly disappearing, par ticularly the eagle, which is now seldom seen. Singing birds of various kinds became plenty soon after the settlement of the county, and yet remain. The streams abounded in fish of large size. Elias Hughes once gigged or speared a pike, which, when suspended to the top of his cabin door reached to the floor. The pike were from two to five feet in length. Isaac Stadden once, in early times, shot a pike at \"high banks\" in the Licking, near his residence, that measured nearly six feet in length. He ran a stick through its gills, and when placed on his shoulder the tail of the fish touched the ground. The pike has almost, if not entirely, disappeared from the waters of the county. The catfish was plenty and of large size, but"], [185, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. i77 there were no eels. The white perch and sucker were numerous and of large size; the black jack and clear jack were here and grew large, but have long since disappeared. The streams, no less than the forests, contributed to the support of the early settlers. Indeed so plenty were game, fish, fur animals, and the fruits and other spontaneous pro ductions that it was hardly necessary to till the ground to procure subsistence. Serpents were of many varieties and in great abundance. Especially numerous were the rattle snake, the copper-head viper, blacksnake, garter snake and watersnake. They were often found in the cabins of the settlers and even in their beds. It was not unusual for the settlers to be bitten by them, but few, if any, deaths occurred from this cause, as the settlers understood the treatment of snake bites. There was a snake den on the south bank of Licking river, a mile below Newark, in the year 1803, which the settlers determined to break up. They accordingly procured a quantity of powder, and blew it up, the snakes flying high in the air, and in every direction, killing many of them; still the survivors were sufficiently numerous to be more or less annoying and troublesome. For many years the people were troubled with snakes, but the venomous kind have long since disappeared. Scorpions and lizards abounded, and were not in high favor with the pioneers. Insects of various kinds were numerous and troublesome. Spiders, particularly, were plenty and of large size. Gnats, hornets, yellow-jackets, musquitoes and horse-flies were in great abundance and exceedingly annoying to man and beast. The wolf and the more venomous serpents were the most formidable and annoying enemies of the early settlers. Panthers were much dreaded, but fortunately were not numerous. The fox, mink and pole-cat frequently made raids on the hen-roost. Most of these animals, especially the more troublesome ones, have long since disappeared. The distinct class known in pioneer times as the hunter, a class of which Elias Hughes and John Channel were fair representatives, has pretty nearly gone out of existence. So also has the class known as the trapper, represented by Billy Uragoo and Joel Williams. Those also known as fishermen, represented by John Sparks and John Scamma horn, have almost disappeared as a distinct class. People change, and conform their lives to the times in which they live."], [186, "CHAPTER XX. MINERALOGY AND PALEONTOLOGY. Mineralogy of Flint Ridge \u2014 Professor Read on the Flint of Flint Ridge\u2014 Coal Deposit \u2014 Isaac Smucker on the Formation of Mineral Coals and the Paleontology of Flint Ridge. \"Arts perfect forms no moral need, And beauty is its own excuse ; But for the dull and flowerless weed Some healing virtue still must plead, And the rough ore must find its honors in its use.\" \u2014 Whittier. TN mineralogy there is much to interest the scien- 1 tist and business man, within the county lim- its. Perhaps Flint ridge is one of the most inter- esting localities for the mineralogist. Hon. Isaac Smucker thus writes of it : ' ' Mineralogy has an admirable and extensive development in Flint rid^e. There the mineralogical manifestations are not only diversified, but also highly interesting. Among the stones, rocks, ores, metals, clays, earths and minerals found on and in Flint ridge are the flint or buhr-stone, the sand-stone, the horn- stone, the lime-stone, the oil-stone, the conglomerate rock, the iron ore, the granite boulder, fire-clay, blue-clay shale, slaty clay, potter's clay, slate, bituminous slate, bituminous coal, and cannel coal. \"The economic value of some of the foregoing deposits has been considerable, at different times. To the aboriginal inhabi- tants the flint-stones of the ridge must' have been of great value, as from them they made, during many passing ages, their knives, spear and arrow heads, and perhaps other implements and ornaments. The flint of the ridge was, for many years, extensively manufactured into mill-stones, or what millers called \"buhrs,\" and liberal profits were realized, but of late years this branch of manufacture has been abandoned, the French buhr being found superior in quality. Moreover, the best quality of the flint of the ridge, which alone was suitable for buhrs, was mainly worked out, and what remains is not attainable, or, at least, is not so readily quarried as to justify the continued profit able prosecution of the aforesaid industry. In many mills, however, in early times in Ohio, and until a comparatively recent period, the Flint ridge buhrs were used, and found to be an economical and excellent substitute for the French buhr, par ticularly for grinding corn, rye and buck-wheat. It is also said that the purer portions of the flint made good oil-stones, and when crushed also served a valuable purpose in manufac turing glass, and, I believe, also fire-brick. ' ' The iron ore of Flint ridge has probably not been found sufficient in quantity, nor of such quality as to admit of ex tensive utilization, by the erection of furnaces ; and it is too re mote from such as are now in operation to pay transportation. The same may also be said of the building stones of the ridge, and for the same reason their use has been limited. But the fire-clay, as well as the potter's clay, has been brought into market in the form of fire-brick, and in the manufacture and sale, to a considerable extent, of the well-known stone-ware, long and extensively known in Ohio and in the west. \" Bituminous coal has not been mined on the Flint ridge to any extent, its seams being too thin to admit of it with profit. But the cannel coal of the ridge has been mined and marketed for a period of more than forty years, and continues to be thus mined and marketed, presumably with a fair profit. It is used to some extent for the manufacture of gas in Newark, as well as for fuel purposes there, and in the neighborhoods adjacent to the mines. For a time, says Professor Read {see volume three, Ohio Geology, page 356), it was extensively used for the pro- duction of coal-oil, the following average yield being obtained from the distillation of a ton of coal : Crude oil, forty gallons; Refined oil, seventeen and one-half gallons ; Lubricating oil, seven and one-half gallons ; Paraphine, three and three-fourths to five pounds. When crude petroleum was placed upon the market at tvio cents per gallon in 1861-62, this branch of industry was of necessity suspended, and has not since been resumed, owing to the impossibility of competing with the petroleum of the oil wells. ' ' The main entrance into the Flint ridge cannel coal bed is that of the Licking County Cannel Coal company, more than a mile from the western termination of the ridge, at a point, says Pro.- fessor Read, about one hundred feet, by his barometer, and one hundred and four feet by other measurements, below Flint ridge, meaning, I suppose, below its highest point. The pro- fessor found it 'capped' by a thick bed of lime-stone, presenting with the coals, shales and fire-clays, the following section: Earthy lime-stone, two and one-half feet; Pure lime-stone, two and one-half feet; Cannel coal, one foot; Fire-clay, three feet; Cannel coal, four feet; Black shale, nine inches; Cannel coal, ten inches; Fire-clay, thickness not given. An analysis of the Flint ridge cannel coal giyes, approxi mately, in round numbers, twenty percent, of ash, thirty?seven per cent, of voltatile matter, and forty-three per cent, of fixed car bon. President Orton, of the Ohio State University, pronoun ces it the best cannel coal in Ohio {as can be seen by reference to volume four, page 913, of Ohio Geology). 178"], [187, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. i79 Professor Read, above quoted, says, regarding the flint of Flint ridge : *\"Any one traversing this ridge for the first time would be sur prised to find such a deposit on such a geological horizon. It simulates very accurately the broken-up debris of a vertical dike, the fragment often covered with perfect crystals of quartz, the rock itself being highly -crystaline and often translucent. It is something of a puzzle to understand how such a deposit is found in a series of undisturbed and unmodified rocks- The adjacent surfaces of two blocks of the chert are often found covered with the quartz crystals of considerable size, as thoroughly interlocking with each other as if one were a cast and the other a matrix. I cannot imagine the conditions which would spread such a deposit over the floor of a sea or any other body of water. A substitution of silicious matter deposited from solution, in the place of a soluble limestone previously de posited, is the only plausible 'explanation. This substitution has taken place over large areas in this part of the State, and has left these silicious deposits only upon the horizons of the different limestones. Professor Read continues, regarding the coal deposit in different parts of the county: \"Coal No. i is, in several localities in the county, of sufficient thickness to be mined for local consumption. In some places it rests upon a thin bed of carboniferous conglomerate, in others upon the olive shales of the Waverly; a bed of fire-clay and a thin stratum of shale being sometimes interposed between it and these rocks. \"In Madison township, about two miles southeast of New ark, about two hundred tons of this coal have been taken from Dr. Wilson's mine. The coal, as far as worked, was of fine quality, and reached a thickness of thirty inches. Near this point, a shaft sunk through the coal^disclosed the including strata as follows : \"First \u2014 Shale, four feet. ' ' Second \u2014 Coal, two feet. \" Third \u2014 Conglomerate. \"On this hill the limestone of the cannel coal is, by barome ter, one hundred feet above coal No. r. On the southeast quarter of section one, Hopewell township, entries have been carried into the coal where it is reported to be from eighteen to twenty inches thick. On Lewis Baker's land, Mary Ann town ship, it is found near the top of the hill, and, when opened, ranges in thickness from one and a half to two feet. The Con glomerate here appears in a bed a few feet below it. \"On Wesley Painter's land, in the west part of Fallsbury township, coal No. i has about the same thickness, and the including strata, are as follows: \"First \u2014 Gray shale, thickness undetermined. ' ' Second \u2014 Coal, one and a half to two feet. \" Third \u2014 Fire-clay, one foot. \"Fourth \u2014 Hard, white sand-rock, with Stigmaria. \"At an opening on Jacob Priest's land, in Fallsbury town ship, this coal is from two and a half to three feet thick, in two benches; is bright and hard; a very good coal; but containing a rather large percentage of sulphur. On the whole this is the best exposure of coal No. r observed in the county, but as the roof is sandstone, it is more liable to be reduced in thickness as the entry is carried further into the hill. \"It will be apparent that the coal of the county is quite lim- ited in quantity, and that, aside from the cannel, none of it is first quality. \"Citizens report that coal has been found on Alligator hill, a little east of Granville. Several excavations have been made into the hill, and one near the top. All expose shaly sand stone, which can be clearly identified as Waverly, and the debris of the Waverly is strewn over the surface of the highest part. I think no coal can be found in the hills, in this part of the county. It is true that in several places on the western margin of our coal-fields coal is found, in one sense, below the Upper Waverly. It is found, topographically, beiow it, noj geologically, in valleys, on the slopes of the Waverly hills, which, in this neighborhood, rose above the old coal-marshes, and marked the original western limit of the coal-fields. My observations in this county, and northward, along the margin of the coal-field, render it very certain that the supposition some times made, that the Ohio coals were once continued westward over the Devonian and Silurian rocks to the Indiana and Illi nois field, and that they have since been carried away by ero sion, is untenable.\" The following extracts are from the address of B. C. Woodward : \"There is a directing and compensating Providence in nature. That which was denied to eastern Licking county by the bene fits of the drift, was presented to it by the sweeping waste of waters. Stores of minerals laid up in prior periods were undis turbed and kept for the use of civilized man. Ohio geologists have conceded to this but a little corner of Bowling Green and Hopewell townships as included within the great Alleghany coal-field. Yet there are small lenticular masses of coal, some in workable beds, in Madison, Franklin, Bowling Green, Hope well, Hanover, Mary Ann, Perry and Fallsbury townships. These small, isolated coal-fields present an instructive lesson, for though remote from each other, the quality is so similar, that it may, with a single exception, be called identical in kind and quality. \"That exception is the cannel coal of the flint ridge; all other beds afford that variety called by miners cherry coal. It is dry, burns without much flame, makes a hot fire, and is valu able fuel. The sameness of the coal in all the different beds, teaches that it was all produced under like conditions. This is shown, too, by the fossil plants associated with it in its sev eral deposits. The cannel coal of Flint ridge is limited to a small district, perhaps not more than three hundred acres, is a workable bed, valuable for gas, oil or fuel. The working of this bed shows that active energies have operated here since the formation of coal. The fossil shells, especially the lingula, with other mollusks of the same age, indicate that it is an an cient deposit. The Flint ridge itself, being composed of silica in a greater or less crystaline state, enclosing, in many instances, fossil shells, indicate that heat, and perhaps hot water, impreg nated with silica, has been active there, with a force sufficient to upheave it to its present level. \"The Hopewell coal, in the neighborhood of Gratiot, is of true bituminous variety. This is a deep stratum, and one of the best coal mines in the State. ' ' Although the early settlers were fully aware of these coal deposits, they, from force of circumstances, did not for some years, give much attention to them. The clearing of the land furnished an abundance of fuel, and hence they did not need the coal. But as the forests disappeared, its importance was"], [188, "i8o HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. bv water action, or by any other cause that resulted in inunda tion, which would by its sedimentary accumulations, form a covering for those beds of vegetable deposits. Most of those sedimentary accumulations are sand, pebbles, gravel, cfty, mud, and other earthy matter. Where the sedimentary deposit is sand, and all favorable circumstances are present and contin ued in active operation for long ages, the present product would be a bed of sandstone; when, by reason of a strong current, pebbles were carried along with the sand and intermingled with it, the result would be a conglomerate sandstone, such as is found at the mouth of the Rocky fork, and all along through the \"Licking narrows;\" where earthy matter, gravel and clay are the deposit, the products are, of course, different; and where the deposit consists of a combination of any or all of those materiels, there is no difficulty in arriving at a correct knowl edge of the facts in the case; and finally, when the sedimentary deposit is what is popularly called a kind of a clayey mud, if the requisite constituent elements are present, such as silex, alumina, oxide and sulphate of iron, potash, magnesia and carbon, the product will ultimately be shale or argillaceous slates. These shale and slate deposits are often found in layers immediately above and below coal-beds, and generally contain more or less of carbonaceous matter, and possibly other con stituent elements of mineral coal, in limited quantities. The amount of carbon they contain is so small as to preclude their use as fuel, although they are, in a sense, combustible, and by heat can be reduced to their original elements. This may be chiefly because they have been so long in proximity to the coal deposits, where they were placed by the action of water, and solidified in pursuance of the operation of nature's laws. \"Water action, let it be borne in mind, is an important agency, indeed an essential instrumentality in coal production, and I might add also in most other productions, as well as in giving shape and form to the surface of our globe, for it has assuredly been instrumental in floating into position the mate rials of which the earth is composed. The processes of coal formation, and the production of numerous other inanimate things of this world, are in active operation now, as they have been through the almost interminable geological ages of the past, and will so continue through the long cycles of the coming future. Indeed the process of creation itself is, in an import ant sense, a continuity \u2014 thus far it has been a progressive work, is still going on, and may go on unceasingly. A day with the Lord, the Bible informs us, is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day, that is, as one day of creation, by which is meant simply an indefinitely long geological day, age or period, as Hugh Miller, the author of \"The Old Red Sand stone,\" also of \" The Foot-prints of the Creator,\" and of \"The Testimony of the Rocks,\" has maintained, making the six days of creation in Genesis to stand for six indefinitely long geo logical days or periods. In these views of the biblical.bear ings of geology he has the concurrence of Professors Silliman and Hitchcock and many other Christian scientists. \"Cuvier, the great naturalist, taught that the earth had been inhabited by a succession of different series of animals that ultimately became extinct, and that those of each period were peculiar to the age in which thev lived. And the same is true also of aquatic and marine animals. The extinction, from natural causes, of the huge animals that once existed in the Ohio valley, as their remains will show, such as the mastodon, the megatherium and the mammoth, and their substitution by others better adapted to existing atmospheric, climatic and more appreciated, and its extent more fully developed. Wher ever coal is found, iron is associated with it. The Mary Ann furnace, in operation some thirty-five years, produced thou sands of tons of iron from the ores of the county. The Gran ville furnace was chiefly supplied with ores from the same coal region, and has produced several thousand tons of the metal.\" The following extract from the address of Hon. Isaac Smucker, delivered at the Young Men's Christian Association rooms, January 2, 1880, re garding the formation, etc., of mineral coals, will be found interesting in this connection: \"It is one of the well established facts of geology and chem istry that all mineral coals are of vegetable origin, hence botany is enlisted to elucidate phenomena relating to them. They are composed of the strange, gigantic flora or herbaria of the past, the far past carboniferous epoch, innumerable specimens of which have been so faithfully preserved in our coal-beds. Geol ogists teach us that the different strata or layers of coal were, each one, originally deposited at or upon the surface, and that deposits were repeated at intervals, of variable distances or pe riods of time apart, being separated by parallel layers of sand stone, shales, limestone and other rock formations, ranging in thickness from a foot or two to an hundred feet, and some times more, the deposit or production of which, between the various strata or beds of coal must have required the lapse of many thousands of years, perhaps in most cases many times tens of thousands of years. The numerous deposits of coal, and the intervening layers of stones of different kinds are cred ited mainly to the indefinitely long geological period known as the carboniferous. I say mainly but not wholly, for I think it can be demonstrated that the process of coal production, or at least of the inferior kinds, such as peat and lignite is now going on in lagoons, marshes and bogs, and probably has been going on ever since the termination of the carboniferous or great coal age. \"That our coals, in all their varieties, embracing peat, lig nite, brown coal, bituminous, cannel, anthracite coal, also coke, plumbago, or graphite, are of vegetable origin, seems to be a generally admitted fact, and if further proof were needed, it could be found by closely observing certain natural processes now going on; for in nature, coal, or at least peat and lignite, can be seen in various stages of formation where vegetable tis sue is heaped up and accumulated in bogs. On digging deep down into these bogs where the woody matter is surrounded by moisture and other favorable condidions for gradual decompo sition, it is ascertained that the slow process of transforming said woody material into the combustible called peat is going on. And when peat becomes hardened by the lapse of ages, by diminished moisture, by evaporation, through the action of the elements, and otherwise changed by other causes, it becomes lignite. It is known that in the oldest peat bogs in Europe, at or near their bottom, a thin stratum of coal is generally found, and that there is reason to believe that the entire material com posing those bogs, if undisturbed, would ultimately, under a combination of favorable circumstances develop into coal-beds, the afore-named stratum at or near the bottom of the bogs, be ing the incipient formation thereof. Those favorable circum stances are, in part, the continued full growth, fdr an indefin itely long period, of aquatic vegetation, the debris of which would ultimately, by depression or sinking of the locality, and"], [189, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. i8i general conditions, fully coroborate the views here expressed. And the same is true of other animals, also of reptilian mons ters now extinct, and of birds and insects, whose places have been taken by others. could not exist in it; hence no fossil remains of such are found in our coal-beds, or in the earth or stone formations of an in terior age. \" Early in the carboniferous age the coal-plants were doubt less of comparatively limited size, whose leaves floated on the surface of shallow marshes or lagoons. Gradually those aquatic plants grew larger and larger, the existing and steadily augment ing conditions for their better development being present, they naturally took root in increasing quantities and strength in those lagoons or marshes whose surfaces were partially covered with water, adding the growth of each year, slowly and silently, to the accumulating mass. As the age advanced these plants attained to a larger and still larger size, whose immense leaves and spreading branches would ultimately die and sink to the bottom, and thus form a bed for succeeding vegetable growths of such proportions and in such quantities as to throw into in significance anything of the same species in our day! This process, repeated for an indefinitely long period, finally resulted in producing peat, lignite, coal of various kinds, coke and plumbago. The horse-tail flag, fossilized in coal-beds, has been found fourteen inches in diameter, while now it seldom reaches a thickness of one inch. Club-mosses, even within the tropics, are now of small size, while in coal formation, petrified, they have been found as thick as a man's body and fifty feet or more in length. Our ferns are of diminutive, dwarfish size, but in carboniferous times they reached the height of more than fifty feet. 'Other coal-plants,\" says Maury, 'grew to the same wonderful proportions, and as they fell others sprang up, and thus the ' heaping ' process continued until nature caused some subsidence of the ground, the water closed over it all, and the currents deposited mud or sand; if the former a layer of slate was the ultimate result; if the latter a stratum of sandstone would be formed; and if pebbles were intermingled with the sand, the result would be a layer of conglomerate sandstone, such as we have in great abundance aiong the banks of the Rocky fork and in the ' Licking narrows,' which, it is plain to be seen, was formed exactly as here suggested.' After this subsidence, and the inundation ceased, the water having formed another bed or channel, fresh growths sprang up and a new deposit was formed, to sink and be covered up in turn; and as often as these periods of rest and submergence were repeated, so often would a new bed of coal come into ex istence, and in this oft-repeated process is found the simple, ra tional explanation why the coal measures generally consist of more than one seam or stratum; or in other words why there happen to be intervening or alternate sedimentary strata be tween the beds or layers of coal, the lower one of these coal strata, and its sedimentary covering, being, in many instances, found to be more than a thousand feet below the surface of the earth. This is undoubtedly more generally the known state of facts in Great Britain, where shaft-mining is the common method, than in the United States, where out-croping beds of coal are mainly utilized, and which in a sense is known as sur face-mining. The thickness of those sedimentary deposits be tween the coal strata (sometimes a hundred feet or more), fur nishes some idea of the immense duration of the uncounted ages or cycles of time that passed by, during the process of their formation. To accomplish a single revolution of the pre cession of the equinoxes, or what is known as a movement of the equinoctial points from east to west, requires but little less then twenty-five thousand years, and we are told by geologists that very 'many of those revolutions were recorded on nature's \"The main or essential factors in coal production, during the carboniferous period, were: first, an atmosphere so heavily charged with carbon as to preel ude the possibility of the ex istence of warm-blooded animals; second, a huge growth of aquatic vegetation; third, heat; fourth, water action; fifth, moisture; sixth, decomposition; seventh, weight or pressure; eighth, a favorable climate; ninth, time. And when and where all the foregoing conditions and elements are present and in ac tive operation, the elements being in proper proportions and com binations, and the climate is favorable for coal production, then, of course, the result will be coal. Chemists have, by chemical combinations and processes, manufactured coal, and therefore know all about its constituent elements, but the chemist with his retort charged with materials for manufacturing coal is at a dis advantage in competition with the production of nature's labor atory. Of course the formation of coal, or rather of peat and lignite, is now at much slower process than it was during the ages of more luxuriant vegetable growths, and when carbon was so redundant as to render warm. blooded life impossible. \" ' In Holland, Denmark and Sweden,' says Lesquereux, ' the thick deposits of peat are separated into distinct beds by strata of sand and mud, giving the best possible elucidation of the process of stratification of the coal measures.' ' For their formation,' says Maury, 'these bogs require a basin rendered impermeable by a substratum of clay and an active growth of aquatic or semi-\u00e6rial plants, having their roots in water, while their branches and leaves expand on the surface thereof, or rise in the air above it, constantly growing in the same place, whose debris, falling year after year,, is heaped up and preserved against atmospheric decomposition by stagnant water or great humidity in the air. ' It was during the carboniferous epoch, the geological age of gigantic vegetable growths, when our principal and most valuable beds of coal were deposited; and then it was when all the most favorable circumstances for the production of coal were in their highest development; when, in fact, the conditions which tended most to promote the rapid for mation of coal, in the different varieties, were all present and in active operation. \" During the carboniferous age of the earth's history, water covered very much more of its area than it does now, and por- tions of the continents were so little raised above its surface that a slight elevation or depression would change the lagoons, marshes and bogs into dry land, or sink them below the surface of the sea. When air passes over, or rests on oceans, lakes or rivers, it becomes laden with vapor, whose influence is very po- tent, as the power of vapor to absorb and retain is very many times greater than that of air; hence as water then prepondera- ted so largely over land, the atmosphere was heavily charged with moisture, which, as well as heat, was essential in a coal- producing climate. In fact the absence of annual rings or concentric circles, in carboniferous plants, found as fossils in our coal-beds, proves that there was no winter when and where our coal was produced; and as the same kind of coal-plants grew at the same time in Europe and America, as geologists have demonstrated, the same climate, substantially, must then have prevailed on both sides of the Atlantic. During the car boniferous epoch the atmosphere was so largely charged with carbonic acid that, as already stated, warm-blooded animals"], [190, "l82 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. pages, during the progress of the accumulations of the sedi mentary substances which formed but a single one of the lay ers, deep down in the earth, resting upon the surface of a coal bed below it, and under another above it. ' ' After the vegeteble deposits which formed coal-beds were covered up, Maury says, ' a gradual decomposition took place, which consisted in an evolution of a portion of the carbon, and most of the hydrogen and oxygen, in the form of water and gasses from the woody, tissue, leaving a larger and larger per centage of the carbon of the plant behind, while the increased pressure of the accumulating strata above, served to compress and solidify the mass,' which before had been in a state of fusion, probably of about the consistence of tar in a mild climate. \"But before this solidification took place, as Liebig has proved by direct experiment, in the process of slow decomposi tion of vegetable matter in water, a softening had occurred, and it is to this that we must ascribe the fact that no delicate fossils are ever found in the coal itself, as the tissue and form were destroyed by the softening and subsequent pressure, though cases are met with where solid trunks of trees have re sisted this softening process, and are found standing erect in the seams while their roots are plainly traced in the clay slates below. In the shales and slates above and below, which it will be remembered, were originally soft, plastic mud, naturally, therefore, the plant impressions therein are as sharp and clear as though they had been sketched with an artist's pencil.\" After citing various eminent authorities in proof of the correctness of his theory, Mr. Smucker con tinues: \" From the foregoing it will be seen that I have been dealing with a solved problem, a problem that scientists have often solved by the methods of the laboratory \u2014 by the microscope \u2014 by critical investigation \u2014by close examination \u2014 by careful observation and philosophical reasoning \u2014 by scientific and logical deduction \u2014 by intelligent experiment \u2014 by accurate in spection \u2014 by established data as to causes and their effects \u2014 by the concurrent belief and testimony of nearly all the eminent geologists of Europe and America, who have written upon the subject, and who are supported substantially by most of the learned professors of science in the principal colleges and universities of both the eastern and western continents, and no less by oft-repeated and unmistakable demonstration itself. \"I have expressed the belief in this paper that the process of peat, lignite and perhaps coal production is now going on, as it has been going on through the slow-moving and well-nigh unending geological ages of the past, and probably will continue to go on through all future time! And I will take this occasion to express the belief that there is now in process of formation a bed of peat, within the limits of Newark. The location of this bed of peat is between the North Fork feeder and the North Fork creek. If Locust street were extended due east over the feeder to the creek, it would pass near it. \"Again, I think peat could be found in,the swamp between the Central railroad and the Cherry Valley road, a mile or more west of Newark. That swamp was largely a dry prairie, serving the purposes of a race-track until the earthquakes in the Mississippi valley, in 1811-12, when, by depression, it was transformed into a pond, and remained such until it was parti ally drained, some thirty years ago. The belief is not an un- reasonable one that peat has been in process of formation there during many of the ages of the past, and that that process is still going on, and will certainly not cease as long as the condi- tions for the production of that material remain favorable. \"And there is but little doubt that the Cranberry marshes in the vicinity of the reservoir and also the Bloody Run swamps, near Kirkersville, are peat-bearing localities. And finally, I refer to another locality within the limits of Licking county, where the surface or external appearances are equally promising indications of the existence and progressive growth of peat: I mean the Cranberry marsh, in early times called \" Warthan's Prairie, \" and later, \"Wilson's Prairie,\" situated a few miles southeast of Utica. And what is true of the above- named localities is doubtless as true of many points of similar external appearance and surroundings, found to a greater or less extent in every section of our country.\" In another address Mr. Smucker says regard- ing the paleontology of Flint ridge : \"The paleontology of the Flint ridge is as yet comparatively but little known. The earlier-time records of that locality were ineffaceably engraved there in fossil characters \u2014 its primeval history was written deep down in the earth by God and nature, in the unerring language of petrifaction; its old-time annals were indelibly inscribed in the unmistakable nomenclature of geology; upon its extensive beds of minerals, stones and rocks, its organic remains, imbeded in the limestone formations far down beneath the surface, tell us of the great past, when this ridge was in its primeval condition, long ages before man existed or could exist upon it; its vegetation in petrifaction, imprinted with nature's graver, upon its coal and other de- posits, tells us in the more than exactness and certainty of scien- tific language of the long geological ages and carboniferous epochs, now long gone by, when another and more luxuriant vegetation, one much more charged with carbon, grew and flourished there, and when marine organisms also were redun- dant there as well as in contiguous land and water localities, which, largely by water action, contributed the now fossilized vegetable and organic remains found in the coal, limestone and other mineral formations of the Flint ridge. \" But although the lexicon of paleontology is given to us in petrified or stone characters, letters and words, and in well marked fossilized vegetation, such as plants and shrubs and trees, also of distinct and almost living organic forms that were once animate with life, engraved by nature upon our long buried sedimentary stones and rocks and other mineral deposits; nevertheless the careful and persevering student of the alphabet in which that lexicon was written, soon learns to read, translate, interpret and understand it as if it were a matter settled as with the unerring certainty of demonstrated science itself. All this can be done, has been done, and is being constantly done by those who have untiringly and zealously devoted the requisite amount of time, labor and talents to its accomplishment. '\"By the study of organic remains,' said the late Col. Foster, 'it has been discovered that each of the sedimentary deposits has its characteristic fossils. By this means we can determine the epochs of the different formations, identify the same forma tion at remote points, and throughout all its lithological changes, and even calculate with some degree of certainty the periods when the present mountain chains were lifted up. These fossils,' he continues, 'indicate a progressive develop ment of organic life from the coral, closely allied to the ve\u00b0-e-"], [191, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 1 83 table, up to man, the head of created beings. From them also we learn the various revolutions which the earth has undergone, the changes in the temperature of its surface, and the animals which peopled it in periods far remote.' \"The author of the foregoing paragraph (the late Colonel Foster), when a member of the Ohio corps of geologists, in 1837, explored Flint ridge, in the interest of paleontology, and reported that he found fossilized organic remains there in great perfection and beauty. The following he named as of most frequent occurrence : ''First \u2014 Terebratula, that is, a genus of bivalve mollusks of the class Brackiopoda, in which one of the valves is perforated for the transmission of a sort of tendinous ligament, by which the animal fixes itself to submarine animals. This order of molluscous animals is also characterized by two fleshy arms or labial processes, which they can protrude or withdraw, and which serve for prehension. \"Second \u2014 Encrini. a fossil belonging to theasteria or star-fish family, consisting of numerous pointed arms radiating from around a centre in which the mouth is situated, and is sup ported on a jointed stem, therein differing from all the recent asterias. \" Third \u2014 Anthophylla, described by Colonel Foster as a min eral of the horn-blende family, occurring in brittle fibres, or fibrous or bladed masses (primarily flower and leaf,) of differ ent shades of dark brown, and with a semi-metallic lustre. It consists chiefly of silica, magnesia and oxyd of iron, and is found abundantly in some varieties ot primary rocks. \"Fourth \u2014 Spirifera, known as an extinct genus of mollusks, having a shell with two internal calcareous spiral appendages. \"Fifth \u2014 Infusoria, described by Dana as microscopic animals nhabiting waters and liquids of various kinds, and having no organs of motion, except exceedingly minute hairs. \"Sixth \u2014 Trilobites, an extinct family of Crustacea, found in the earliest fossiliferous strata, Colonel Foster reported, were also found in a limestone on the ridge, and remarked that its occurrence (it being a fossil not observed, generally, in the coal measures), indicated that it flourished there after it had ceased to exist in other countries. \" Seventh \u2014 Lingiila, which belongs to the grass family of fos sils, with flat leaves, not including the stem or the sheath of the stem. One author speaks of some specimens of this class of fossils as having the form of ' a strap-shaped corrolla of flowers. ' \"Eighth \u2014 Producta, which is an extinct genus, says a late author, of bivalve shells closely allied to the living genus Tere bratula (described as the first of this list), and which the writer says are found only in the older secondary rocks. \" Professor E. B. Andrews, who, as one of the geological corps of Ohio, explored Flint ridge in r86c., gives us some informa- tion in regard to the palentology of that locality. He says that the basins or depressions which contain the cannel coal were filled with water while the process of coal formation was going on, which is proved by the abundant presence of the marine shell Lingula. He also obtained a specimen of Stigmaria, made up of coal itself, which still retained its cylindrical form. It is a fossil coal plant, says Buckland, having a large dome shaped stem or trunk. Both were found by Professor Andrews most abundant in the lower part of the coal. In the lower coal measures of Flint ridge he also found a specimen of Syno cladia or Biserialis, that is, a double-rowed class of fossils, notched on the edge like a saw, or a serrate leaf, pointing to the extremity, some of them having the serratures toothed. It grows in very rapidly, spreading, funnel-shaped form, the stems seeming to radiate from the same point, and throwing off on each side lateral branches, which also give off, in the same way, lateral branchlets. \" Professor Andrews also found specimens of the Ptilodictya, or bifurcated ramose, the bifurcations occurring usually at rather distant intervals. They were branched as a stem or root. having lateral divisions, poriferous surfaces, six to eight longi tudinal rows, separated by spaces of double the diameter of the spores.\" Professor Andrews also found shells of the genus Placunofsis. which were slightly oblique, with lengths and breadths nearly equal, cardinal margin nearly straight, not quite equaling the greatest breadth of the valves, beak small, depressed, and but slightly projecting beyond the cardinal margin, near the middle of which it is placed, with scarcely perceptible obliquity. Another shell was found in. the dark shales of the Flint ridge coal measures, described by Professor Andrews as obliquely subovate, compressed, very thin, posterior basal margin regu larly rounded, and surface marked by regular concentric undu ations, with intermediate parallel stri\u00e6. And still another shell was found on the ridge, which was de scribed as of large size, of smooth surface, or showing only obscure lines of growth. A full description of most of the foregoing, found by Professor Andrews, is given in volume two, Ohio Paleonthology, pages 326-37. Professor Andrews also reported a bed of dark blue fossil iferous limestone, ranging in thickness from twelve to fourteen feet, situated four feet nine inches above the cannel coal at the mine, and separated from it by a deposit of blue clay slate of four inches of bituminous coal, and a stratum of five inches of bituminous slate. This limestone he found abounding in fossils, and he states that he utilized them so far as to make a hand some collection, but he did not furnish a detailed description of them. The shales and limestone of Flint ridge were found by Professor Andrews to have identically similar fossils. Further explorations would doubtless richly reward, with abundant suc cess, the palenthologists' labors on the ridge."], [192, "CHAPTER XXI. ARCH\u00c6OLOGY.

It must be collected scrap by scrap, and item by item, after a thorough examina tion and patient investigation of their works, and by careful, laborious, faithful study of their won derful remains. The principal events and leading incidents in the strange career of this mysterious and apparently now extinct people, can be traced out and recorded only so far as they are clearly in dicated by those of their works which yet remain, but which, it is to be regretted, are, to a large ex tent, in a state of mutilation and partial ruin, and rapidly tending to utter extinction under incono clastic wantonness, and the operations of the plow; also from the devastating effects of the ele ments, and the destructive tendencies of the great destroyer \u2014 Time. There is no reason to believe that the Mound Builders ever had a written language, and, if they had not, it must be manifest that very few authen tic facts pertaining to their domestic and local his tory, can be verified by reliable testimony other than that deduced from their works, which are the sole memorials left by them to enable us to work out the problems of their origin, their history, habits, manners, customs, general characteristics, mode of life, the extent of their knowledge of the arts, of husbandry, their state of civilization, their religion and its rites, their ultimate fate, and the manner and circumstances of their final disappearance, whether by process of absorption from interming ling and intermarrying with other and more vigor ous races, by dispersion or captivity, or by extinc tion through war, pestilence, or famine. back in the bygone time, Lost 'mid the rubbish of forgotten things.\" THE arch\u00e6ologist has found the territory em- braced within the present limits of Licking county a most excellent one. It is probably the most interesting field for the scientist aud antiquari an in the State or United States. When the wave of white emigration reached the Mississippi and Ohio valleys, the discovery was made of strange looking mounds of earth, here and there, and, after a time, learning that these and other similar works were of pre-historic origin \u2014 the work of an unknown race of people \u2014 they were called, in a general way, \"Ancient Mounds,\" and in time the lost race that erected them came to be appropriately named the \"Mound Builders.\" There is no authentic history regarding this people. The known records of the world are silent \u2014 as silent as these monuments that perpetuate their memory. There are many the ories regarding them, but this is all that can be said \u2014 nothing of their origin or end is certainly known. They probably antedate the various Indian tribes who anciently occupied and claimed title to the soil of Ohio. Probably many centuries elapsed between the first occupancy here by the Mound Builders and the advent of the earliest Indian tribes or nations, though this is only conjecture. This county was once, and, peradventure, con tinued to be through many passing centuries, their most favored locality. The extent, variety, elab orate, and labyrinthian intricacies of their works, still found in many sections of Ohio, clearly indi cate the plausibility of this view. Here they dwelt for ages, erected their works and made a long chapter of history, albeit it is yet unwritten \u2014 a"], [193, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. i85 Although generation after generation of Mound Builders here lived and flourished, and, peradven ture, reached the acme of their glory, then passed through age after age of decadence and decrepi tude into '\"the receptacle of things lost upon earth,\" without leaving anything that may properly be called history; and though no records of their exploits have come down to this generation through the intervening centuries, yet their enduring works furnish the laborious student some indications, even though they be slight, of the characteristics of their builders, and afford some data as to the probable history they made during the unknown, perchance barren, uneventful cycles of their indefi nitely long career as a nation or race. As the history of the Mound Builders is yet un written, it is certainly a matter of gratulation that so many way-marks and traces of this people yet remain within the boundaries of Ohio. Their works in the State, still existing in a tolerably per fect condition, are approximately estimated at ten thousand, but they doubtless far exceeded that number at the time of the first permanent Anglo- American settlement here, in 1788. Only such monuments, or remains of ancient works can be properly ascribed to the Mound Builders as were really regarded by the Indian tribes at the period of the first settlement at Mari etta as antiquities, or as the ruins and relics of an extinct race, and \"concerning the origin of which they were wholly ignorant, or only possessed a traditionary knowledge.\" These consisted of mounds, effigies and inclos ures, which are known and designated as the three general classes of ancient works that can be appro priately regarded as belonging to the Mound Build ers. Mounds are sub-divided into sepulchral, sac rificial, temple (or truncated); also of observation, and memorial or monumental. Effigies are sometimes called animal mounds, sometimes emblematic, and frequently symbolical. Inclosures are of several kinds, one class being known as military or defensive works; another as parallel embankments or covered ways; and the third as sacred inclosures. Under the general title of inclosures, are also walls of circumvalation or ramparts constructed for military or defensive works, while others were doubtless walls surrounding the residence of the reigning monarch; perchance others were erected for the performance within them of their national games and amusements, and perhaps many also served a purpose in the performance of their re ligious rites and ceremonies, and facilitated indul gence in some superstitious practices. Most of the above named works were constructed of earth, a few of stone, and perhaps fewer still of earth and stone combined. The title each bears indicates, in a measure, the uses they are supposed to have served. Sepulchral mounds are generally conical in form and are more numerous than any other kinds. They are of all sizes, ranging from a very small al titude, to about seventy feet in height, and always contain one or more skeletons, or parts thereof, or present other plausible indications of having been built or used for purposes of sepulture, and were, unmistakably, memorials raised over the dead. By some arch\u00e6ologists it is maintained that the size of these mounds bears a certain relation to the importance, when living, of the person over whose remains they were erected. In this class of mounds are often found imple ments and ornaments, supposed to have been buried with the person or persons there interred, under the superstitious and delusive notion, still entertained by some tribes of American Indians, who indulge in similar practices, that they might be useful to them in the happy hunting grounds of the future state. The practice being one common to both the In dians and Mound Builders, apparently connects the former with the latter, and raises the presump tion that the Indians may have descended from the Mound Builders. That fire was used in the burial ceremonies of the Mound Builders is manifest from the fact that charcoal is often, if not always, found in close proximity to the skeleton. The presence of ashes, igneous stones, and other traces of the action of fire in these tombs, renders it quite probable this element was employed in their burial ceremonies. Mica is often found in proximity to the skele tons, as well as specimens of pottery, bone and copper beads, and animal bones. The name given to this description of tumuli"], [194, "i86 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. oftenest circular or oval; but, whether round, square, oblong, oval, octangular, or whatever form, are invariably truncated, having the appearance of being in an unfinished condition. They are fre quently surrounded by embankments, and many of them have spiral pathways, steps, or inclined planes leading to their summits. \u25a0 They are gen erally of large base and of comparatively limited altitude. The supposition is that the summits of these mounds were crowned with structures of wood that served the purposes of temples, all traces of which, however, owing to the perishable nature of the materials used in their construction, have disap peared. They were also used to a limited extent for burial purposes, as well as for uses connected with their religion. Mounds of Observation are generally situated upon eminences, and were doubtless \"observa tories,\" \"alarm posts,\" \"watch towers,\" \"signal stations,\" or \"look outs,\" serving the purposes indicated by their title. They are said by some writers to occur in chains or regular systems, and that many of them still bear traces of the beacon fires that were once burning on them. They are sometimes found in connection with embankments and enclosures, forming a portion, though greatly enlarged, of the banks of earth or stones that compose said embankments and enclosures. One of this description is situated two miles west of Newark, and though somewhat mutilated, is yet about twenty-five feet high. This class of mounds is tolerably numerous in some portions of the State. Memorial or Monumental mounds belong to the class of tumuli that were erected to perpetuate the memory of some important event, or in honor of some distinguished character. They are mostly built of earth, but some of the stone mounds found in some portions of the State probably belong to this not numerous class. Effigies or Animal mounds are simply raised figures or gigantic basso relievos lof men, beasts, birds or reptiles, and in some instances, of inani mate objects. They are on the surface of the earth, raised to a limited height, generally from one foot to six feet above the natural surface of the ground. Mr. Schoolcraft, an authority, calls clearly indicates that they were erected chiefly for burial purposes. They generally contain but a limited number of skeletons, indeed, often but a single one; but Professor Marsh, of the Sheffield scientific school, connected with Yale college, a few years ago opened a mound in this county, which contained seventeen skeletons in wfiole or in part. The most remarkable of all mounds in the State, was one in Hardin county, in which were found about three hundred skeletons. A doubt has, however, been expressed that these were all Mound Builders' skeletons \u2014 some persons entertaining the belief that they were Indian remains, as it is well known that the Indians frequently buried their dead on or near the mounds. Sacrificial mounds are usually stratified, the strata being convex layers of clay and loam, alter nating with a layer of fine sand. They generally contain ashes, charcoal, igneous stones, calcined animal bones, beads, stone implements, pottery and specimens of rude sculpture. These mounds are frequently found within enclosures, which were sup posed to have been in some way connected with the performance of the religious rites and ceremo nies of the Mound Builders. An altar of stone or burnt clay is usually found in this class of mounds. These altars, which sometimes rest on the sur face of the original earth, at the centre of the mound are symmetrically shaped, and are among the chief distinguishing characterisicts of sacri ficial mounds. Upon these altars sacrifices of animals, and probably of human beings, were offered, the fire being used to some extent in that superstitious and cruel performance. Some of this class of mounds seem also to have been used for purposes of sepulture as well as sacrifice ; the presence of skeletons, in some of them at least, suggest their sepulchral as well as sacrificial character. In common with sepulchral mounds these like wise contain implements of war, also mica from the Alleghanies, shells from the Gulf of Mexico, obsi dian, and in some instances porphyry from Mexico, as well as silver and copper articles, both for use and ornament. Temple mounds are less numerous and generally larger than the preceding classes,, and in form are"], [195, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. rS7 this class of ancient works Emblematic mounds, and expresses the belief that they were \"Totems\" or \"heraldic symbols.\" Professor Daniel Wilson, the learned author of \"Pre-historic Man,\" and other writers of distinction, call them Symbolical mounds, and hold the opinion that they were erected as objects of worship, or for altars upon which sacrifices were offered, or that they served some other purposes connected with the religious worship of their idolatrous and superstitious con structors. Of the three most notable examples of Effigies in the State, two are situated in this county. One is the Eagle mound, near the center of what is known as the \"Old Fort,\" near Newark; and the other is called the \"Alligator mound,\" and is situ ated on the summit of a hill nearly two hundred feet high, near Granville. Both of these re nowned works will receive more particular atten tion in the histories of the townships in which they are located. Inclosures defensive and sacred, have been briefly mentioned. Most of them are earth-works, though a few are of stone. Defensive enclosures are of irregular form, are always on high ground, and in naturally strong positions, frequently on the summits of hills and steep bluffs, and are often strengthened by exterior ditches. The walls gen erally wind around the borders of the elevations they occupy, and where the nature of the ground renders some points more accessible than others, the height of the wall and the depth of the ditch at those weak points are proportionally increased. The gate-ways are narrow, few in number, and well guarded by embankments placed a few yards inside of the openings or gate-ways, parallel with them, and projecting somewhat beyond them at each end, thus fully covering the entrances, which, in some cases, are still further protected by projecting walls on either side of them. These works are somewhat numerous, and indi cate a clear appreciation of the elements, at least, of fortification, and unmistakably point out the purpose for which they were constructed. A large number of these defensive works consists of a line of ditch and embankments, or several lines carried across the neck of peninsulas or bluff head-lands, formed within the bends of streams \u2014 an easy and obvious mode of fortification, common to all rude peoples. To this class of inclosures belongs that situated on the summit of a hill one mile east of Alligator mound in Licking county. Covered ways are parallel walls of earth of lim ited height, and are frequently found contiguous to inclosures, sometimes, indeed, connecting them by extending from one to another. One of their purposes, at least, seems to have been the protec tion of those passing to and fro within them. Sacred inclosures are mainly distinguished from those of a military character by the regularity of their form, their different construction and their more frequent occurrence. They are of all shapes and forms, and where moats or ditches exist they are invariably found in the inside of the embankments. They are generally in the form of geometrical fig ures of surprising accuracy, such as circles, squares, hexagons, octagons, ellipses, parallelograms and of various others. They are sometimes found within military inclosures, and evidently had some con nection with the religious ideas and ceremonies of their builders. Frequently there is situated in the center of this class of works a mound, or elevation, supposed to have served the purposes of an altar upon which sacrifices were offered, or which was, at least, in some way, used in conducting their re ligious services. Within these sacred inclosures were doubtless celebrated religious festivals, and upon those central mounds or altars were un doubtedly performed, by priestly hands, the rites and ceremonies demanded by their sacrificial and idolatrous religion. The very extensive works near Newark, known as Vkhe \"Old Fort,\" and situated in the fair grounds, evidently belong to this class, and receive particu lar attention in another chapter. Some arch\u00e6olo gists, however, maintain that many works called sacred inclosures were erected for and used as places of amusement, where these ancient people practiced their national games, and celebrated their great national events, where they held their national festivals and indulged in their national jubilees, as well as performed the ceremonies of their religion. It may be that there are those (and there are many such) within which no central elevation or altar occurs, were erected for the purposes last named, and not exclusively (if at all) for purposes"], [196, "i88 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. connected with their religion, and are therefore er roneously called sacred inclosures. Other ancient peoples, if indeed not all the na tions of antiquity, had their national games, amuse ments, festivals and jubilees, and why not the Mound Builders? Without doubt they had, and congregated within their inclosures to practice, cel ebrate and enjoy them. It is natural to indulge in speculations regarding these ancient works. Probably none of them have been constructed since Christopher Columbus reached America in 1492. About sixty years ago a tree which stood upon the bank of the inclosure last named, at a point where the bank was twenty feet high, was cut down, and its concentric circles numbered five hundred and fifty, thus proving con clusively that the said inclosure was constructed more than six hundred years ago. Authorities differ regarding many matters con nected with the Mound Builders, but a few facts seem to be fully established by their works. There can be no doubt that they were a numerous peo ple. Works so elaborate, so gigantic, could not have been erected by a people insignificant in num bers. This is the more apparent when it is con sidered that they were without iron or any suitable metal instruments or tools with which to perform their herculean labors. It could scarcely have been otherwise than that they were also the subjects of a single strong gov ernment, because, under any other, the perform ance of such an immense amount of, probably, enforced labor could not have been secured. Very likely some sort of vassalage or servitude pre vailed. There is abundant evidence that they were a war-like people, and probably, like some savage nations now existing, they made slaves of their prisoners. The number and magnitude of their works, and their extensive range and uni formity, prove that they were essentially homo geneous in customs, habits, religion, and govern ment. The general features common to all their remains identify them as appertaining to a single grand system, owing its origin to men moving in the same direction, acting under common im pulses, and influenced by similar causes. That they possessed military skill, and were not without some knowledge of mathematics, is quite evident. Building their defensive works in natural ly strong positions, and constructing many of their other works in the form of various geometrical figures, show this. The construction of military works would indi cate that they were, occasionally, at least, at war, either among themselves or with some other nation or tribe. If another nation, what other? Perhaps with the North American Indian to whom the country may have belonged before the Mound Builders entered it. There are various scraps of history relating to the antiquity of the Indian. For instance, in the annual report of the council of the American Antiquarian society, page 40, occurs this note from Sir Charles Lyell : \"A human cranium, of the aboriginal type of the red Indian race, had been found in the delta of the Mississippi, beneath four buried forests, superimposed, one upon another, implying, as estimated by Dr. Dovvler, an antiquity of fifty thousand years. ' ' Lyell, himself, estimated the age of the delta at one hundred thousand years. It may be con jectured from many historical facts, that the Mound Builders were a foreign people who in vaded the soil of America, as there is but little evidence that they spread themselves over the continent, but much, that they passed through it from northeast to southwest, covering a broad belt, on which they erected their mysterious mounds. The time occupied by them in crossing the continent can only be conjectured. It is a well known historical fact that the Northmen reached the coast of North America from Green land in 999, A. D. Perhaps the mysterious Mound Builders were no other than these \u2014 they came in great numbers, attempted to conquer the country, found the Indians too strong for them, but con quered a certain portion of the territory, clung together, moved gradually southwest, protecting themselves on the way by forts and other earth works, finally disappearing in Mexico, either con quering that country or intermingling with and be coming absorbed by that people. The Mound Builders were doubtless a supersti tious people, cherishing faith in some religious system. The amount of labor bestowed upon those of their works that were erected in the in terest of their religion, shows a strong tendency"], [197, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 189 STONE RELICS."], [198, "190 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. toward a superstitious belief. They doubtless of fered up animals in sacrifice, as a part of their religious ceremonies, and it may be that human sacrifices were not unknown among them. Pris oners of war are thus disposed of sometimes by peoples and nations who have attained to as high a grade of civilization as that reached by the Mound Builders. The sacrificial character of their religion is clearly established. The late Dr. Foster hesitated not to say that they were worshipers of the elements; that they also worshiped the sun, moon and stars; and that they offered up human victims as an acceptable sacrifice to the gods they worshiped. He deduced this fact from the charred or calcined bones that cover their altars. Other high authorities also un hesitatingly assert that there is convincing proof that they were fire-worshipers. It may be well in this connection to notice, briefly, the implements made and used by this people, especially so far as investigation has re vealed their character in Licking county. Very few copper implements have been found in this part of Ohio, owing partly to the fact of the unexplored condition iof many of the mounds, and to the fact that little, if any, copper exists in this part of the United States. What does exist is in loose fragments that have been washed down from the upper lake region. When mounds are explored, great care is necessary lest these small utensils be lost, as they are commonly scattered through the mass, and not always in close prox imity to the skeletons. The copper deposits about Lake Superior furnished the pre-historic man with this metal, and, judging from the amount of relics made of this metal now found, it must have been quite abundant. The population of the country, then, must have been quite numerous, as occasional copper implements, tempered to an exceeding hardness, are still found about the country. These implements are small, generally less than half a pound in weight, and seldom exceeding three pounds. There were millions of these in use during the period of the ancient dwellers, which must have been hundreds of years in duration. The copper implements left on the surface soon disappeared by decomposition, to which copper is nearly as liable as iron. Only a part of the dead Mound Builders were placed in burial mounds, and of these only a part were buried with their copper ornaments and implements on and about them. Of those that were, only a small part have been discovered, and, in many instances, the slight depth of earth over them has not prevented the decay and disappearance of the copper relics. Articles of bronze or brass are not found with CHISELS, GOUGES AND ADZES."], [199, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. I9I the builders of the mounds. It is evident they knew nothing of these metals in the Ohio valley, nor did they possess any of the copper that had been melted or cast in molds. Stone relics are very numerous and well pre served. Stone axes, stone mauls, stone hammers, stone chisels, etc., are very plentiful yet, and were the common implements of the pre-historic man in this part of the west. None were made with holes or eyes for the insertion of a helve or handles, but were grooved to receive a withe twisted into the form of a handle. Under the head of axes, arch- WEDGE-SHAPED IMPLEMENTS. and not common. They appear to have been manufactured from small, oblong boulders, first brought intp shape by a pick, or chipping instru ment, the marks of which are visible on nearly all of them. They were made more perfect by rub bing and polishing, probably done from time to time after they were brought into use. A handle or helve, made of a withe or split stick, was fast ened in the groove by thongs of hide. The bit is narrower than the body of the axe, which is gen erally not well enough balanced to be of much value as a cutting instrument. \u00e6ologists include all wrought stones with a groove, a bit and a poll. They are found unpolished, partly polished and polished. The bit was made sharp by rubbing, and the material is hard and tough, generally of trachyte, greenstone, granite, quartz or basalt. Most of them are straight on one edge. In Ohio, it is very rare that stone axes are found in the mounds, indicating that they are modern, or were not so much prized by the Mound Builders as to be objects of burial. Occasionally, axes of softer material are found, such as slate, hematite and sandstone, but these are small in size SCRAPERS FLINT"], [200, "192 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. It is very seldom the material is hard enough to cut green and sound timber. The poll is usually round, but sometimes flat, and rarely pointed. It is much better adapted to breaking than cutting, while the smaller ones are better fitted for war-clubs than tools. As a maul to break dry limbs, they were very efficient, which was probably the use made of them. In weight they range from half a pound to sixteen pounds, but are generally less than three pounds. The very heavy ones must have been kept at the regular camps and villages, as they could not have been carried far, even in canoes. Such axes are occasionally found in the Indian towns on the frontier, as they were found in Ohio among the aborigines. The Mounc1 Builders ap parently did not give them as much prominence among their implements as their savage successors. Double-headed hammers have the groove in the middle. They were made of the same material as the axes, so balanced as to give a blow with equal HEAVY STONE AXE. force at either end. Their mechanical symmetry is often perfect. As a weapon in war, they were, indeed, formidable, for which purpose they are yet used among the Indians on the Pacific coast. Implements, known as \"fleshers\" and \"skin ners,\" chisel-formed, commonly called \"celts,\" were probably used as aids in peeling the skins of animals from the meat and bones. For the pur pose of cutting tools for wood, they were not suf ficiently hard, and do not show such use, excepting in a few flint chisels. They may have been applied as coal scrapers where wood had been burned; but this could not have been a general thing with out destroying the perfect edge most of them now exhibit. The grooved axes were much better adapted to this purpose. STONE PESTLE Stone pestles are not plentiful in this county, while stone mortars are rare, indicating that they were made of wood, which is lighter and more easily transported. Most of the pestles are short, with a wide base, tapering toward the top. They were probably used with one hand, and moved about in the mortar in a circle. The long, round instrument, usually called a pestle, does not appear to be fitted for crushing seeds and grain by pounding or turning in the mortar. It was prob-"], [201, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY J93 ably used as a rolling-pin, perhaps on a board or leveled log, not upon stone. It is seldom found smooth or polished, and varies from seven to thir teen inches in length.

There is almost an endless variety of perforated plates, thread-sizers, shuttles, etc. They are usually made of striped slate, most of which have taper- ing holes through them flat-wise, the use of which has been much discussed. The accompanying plate exhibits several specimens of these; but there are, doubtless, many other forms and styles. They are generally symmetrical, the material fine grained, and their proportions graceful, as though PERFORATED PLATES, THREAD SIZERS, SHUTTLES, ETC. as a coat of mail, protecting the breast or back against the arrows of an enemy.

They are nearly all fabricated from striped and variegated slate, highly finished, very symmetrical and elegant in proportion, evidently designed to be ornamental. If they were stronger and heavier, some of them would serve the pur pose of hatchets or battle-axes. The material is compact and fine-grained; but the eyes, or holes, for handles or staves, are quite small, seldom half an inch in diameter. Their edges are not sharp, but rounded, and the body is thin, usually less than one-fourth of an inch in thickness. The form of badges, known as \"double-cres cents,\" are the most elegant and expensive of any yet brought to notice. They were probably used to indicate the highest rank or office.

They were probably emblems of distinction, and were not ornaments. Nothing like them is known among the modern tribes, in form or use, hence they are attributed to the Mound Builders. paint cups are not common in this county; in fact, they are quite rare, but one being known to exist, that in the collection of Dr. Craig, of Mansfield, Ohio. The comparative rarity of aboriginal smoking pipes is easily explained by the fact that thev were not discarded, as were weapons, when those by whom they were fashioned entered upon the iron age. The advances of the whites in no way less ened the demand for pipes, nor did the whites substitute a better implement. The pipes were retained and used until worn out or broken, save the few that were buried with their dead owners. In addition to stone ornaments, the pre-historic man seems to have had a penchant, like his savage successors, to bedaub his body with various colors, derived from different colored minerals. These compounds were mixed in hollowed stones or di minutive mortars \u2014 \"paint cups,\" \u2014 in which the mineral mass of colored clay was reduced to pow der and prepared for application to the body.

In very few instances does an Indian STONE AND CLAY PIPES. that the graves were opened and robbed of this coveted article by members of the same or some other tribes. It only remains to notice the \"flints,\" in addi tion to which a few other arch\u00e6ological relics of minor importance are found about the country, but none of sufficient import to merit mention, or to throw additional light on the lost tribes of Amer ica. Arrow and spear heads and other similar pieces of flaked flints are the most abundant of any aboriginal relics in the United States. They are chiefly made of hard and brittle siliceous ma- terials; are easily damaged in hitting any object at which they are aimed, hence many of them bear marks of violent use. Perfect specimens are, however, by no means rare. The art of arrow making survives to the present day among certain Indian tribes, from whom is learned the art prac ticed that produces them. A classification of arrow heads is not within the scope of this work; indeed, it is rarely attempted by arch\u00e6ologists. The styles are almost as nu merous as their makers. In general, they are all the same in outline, mostly leaf-shaped, varying"], [205, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 197 PERFORATORS \u2014 FLINT.

They may have been chipped \u2014 probably most were \u2014 and some may have been ground. Spear heads ex hibit as large a variety as arrow heads. Like arrow heads, spear heads were inserted in wooden handles of various lengths, though in many tribes they were fastened by thongs of untanned leather or sinews. Their modes of manufacture were generally the same. Sometimes tribes contained \"arrow mak ers,\" whose business was to make these implements selling them to, or exchanging them with, their neighbors for wampum or peltry. When the In dian desired an arrow head, he could buy one of the \"arrow maker\" or make one himself. The common method was to take a chipping imple ment, generally made of the pointed rods of a deer horn, from eight to sixteen inches in length, or of slender, short pieces of the same material, bound with sinews to wooden sticks resembling arrow shafts. \"arrow maker\" held in his left hand the flake of flint or obsidian on which he intended to operate, and pressing the point of the tool against its edge, detached scale after scale, with much ingenuity, until the flake assumed the desired form.

THE next inhabitants in the form of a human being to occupy the territory now embraced in Licking county, after the Mound Builders, were the American Indians. At least such is the gen erally received opinion, though whether the In dians and Mound Builders were not cotempora neous is, perhaps, an open question. The Indian history, as well as that pf the Mound Builders, is a good deal involved in obscurity, and much of it largely dependent on tradition, yet much of it is authentic and reliable. The Indians themselves, however, can be allowed very little, if any, credit for this preservation of their history; it is almost, or entirely, owing to white occupation that they have any history at all. The day is not far distant when the Indian race, as a race, will become extinct. Supposing that this extinction had occurred before white occupa tion of this country, what would the world know of the Indian race? Where are their monuments? Where are their works that would perpetuate their memory? In what particular spot on this great earth have they left a single indelible footprint or imperishable mark to tell of their existence? Not so with the Mound Builders. They left works of an imperishable nature, and from these something of their history may be learned, even though personally they do not appear to exist anywhere. They were evidently workers, and much superior to the Indian, viewed from a civilized standpoint. Colonel Charles Whittlesey's map of the In dians of Ohio gives this territory to the Delawares, except the western tier of townships, which are lo cated in the Shawnee country; it does not appear, \u2014 Joaquin Miller."], [207, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. i99 however, that the Delawares occupied it to any great extent. It was used as a hunting ground by the Wyandots and Shawnees. During the latter half of the last century the Shawnees occupied the Scioto country, and some times spread themselves more or less over this sec tion; but the Wyandots (also called the Hurons) and the Delaivares mainly occupied the country between the Muskingum and Scioto rivers. In 1785, by the treaty of Fort Mclntosh, it was stipulated that the boundary line between the United States and the Delaware and Wyandot na tions, should \"begin at the mouth of the Cuya hoga river and run thence up said river to the por tage between that and the Tuscarawas branch of Muskingum, thence down said branch to the forks (at the present town of Bolivar), thence westerly to the portage of the Big Miami, thence along said portage to the great Miami of the lakes (Maumee river), and down said river to its mouth ; thence along the southern shore of Lake Erie to the mouth of the Cuyahoga, the place of beginning.\" By this treaty, as will be seen, they ceded a large territory, including Licking county, to the United States. It is certain, however, that many of them continued to occupy this territory many years after the date of the above treaty, which they found lit- tle difficulty in doing, as there were then no white settlers to dispute the possession with them. To the Shawnees was assigned, by the treaty of Fort Finney, in 1786, the country between the Big Miami and Wabash rivers. They also relinquished all claims to whatever territory they had in Ohio, but some of them also lingered here, even within the limits of this county, until the of the century, or later. Previous to 1800 there were several Indian vil- lages within the limits of the county. One of these was called \"Raccoon town,\" and was situated on the Raccoon bottom, near Johnstown. This was a Wyandot village, and, in 1807, their posses- sions were purchased by Charles and George Green, who thereafter occupied these lands. An- other was on the Bowling Green, near the Licking river, five miles below Newark. They also had some huts, wigwams, and some small villages on the Licking bottoms, which they occupied tempo- rarily, a mile or two below the junction of the North and South forks, as well as at some other points. A few Shawnees camped for a time on Shawnee run, near or on the farm of Mr. P. N. O'Bannon, which circumstance gave name to the stream. One of the Indian tribes called the North fork \"Pataskala,\" and the main stream be low was, also, so called; but one or more of the Indian tribes also called the latter Lick-Licking. The latter name is supposed to have been given it from the fact of there being in early times some \"salt licks,\" as they were called, upon or near' its banks, which were much resorted to by deer and buffalo, and, subsequent to the settlement of the country, by domestic animals. Hunters were very successful, in early times, at these licks, in securing venison. The Indians in this territory were peace ably disposed toward the whites, and there is no record of any murders or outrages committed by them after the permanent settlement of the county. The shooting of a scout in the eastern part of the county, and the stealing of some horses from the first settlers by the Indians, is fully described in the chapter on the pioneers. Mr. Hutchins, the United States geographer, estimated the number of the Wyandots and Shaw nees, in 1764, at eight hundred warriors \u2014 three hundred of the former and five hundred of the latter. It appears these nations occupied this territory in limited numbers, only as a hunting ground, and that it was out of the line of all their great trails. One of their main trails \u2014 a \"trunk line\" as it were \u2014 crossed the Muskingum river in the vicinity of Zanesville, passing a little south of west across Perry and Fairfield counties, but wholly south of Licking. A branch trail, however, diverged from this main trail, crossed the Muskingum in the vicinity of the present site of Dresden, and strik- ing Licking county, about where Licking river passes out of it, on the east, passed up that river to the vicinity of Bowling Green, where it crossed, and bore southwest to the \"Big\" and \"Little\" lakes, or what is now the reservoir. This reservoir was a favorite resort for the purpose of fishing. This trail passed on from the reservoir to King Beaverstown, near Pickerington, or Lithopolis, in Fairfield county, near the head-waters of the Hock- Hocking."], [208, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 200 A brief history of these nations, their habits and customs, may be appropriate here. Speaking of the Shawanees or Shawanoes, Col onel Johnston, a most excellent authority on such subjects, says: \"We can trace their history to the time of their residence on the tide-waters of Florida, and, as well as the Delawares, they aver that they originally came from west of the Mississippi. Blackhoof, who died at Wapaghkonnetta, at the advanced age of one hundred and five years, and who, in his day, was a very influential chief among the Indians, told me that he remem bered, when a boy, bathing in the salt waters of Florida ; also that his people firmly believed white, or civilized, people had been in the country before them, having found in many instan ces the marks of iron tools upon the trees and stumps.\" Shawanoese means \"the south,\" or the \"people from the south.\"* After the peace of 1763, the Miamis removed from the Big Miami river and a body of Shawnees established themselves at Lower and Upper Piqua, which became their principal headquarters in Ohio. They remained here until driven off by the Kentuckians, when they crossed over to the St. Mary's and to Wapaghkonnetta. The Upper Piqua is said to have contained at one period over four thousand Shawnees. They were very warlike and brave, and often were quite for midable enemies. In the French war, which ended in 1763, a bloody battle was fought near the site of Colonel Johnston's residence, at Upper Piqua. At that time the Miamis had their towns here, which on ancient maps are marked as \"Tewightewee towns.\" The Miamis, Ottawas, Wyandots, and other north ern tribes adhering to the French, made a stand here, assisted by the French. The Delawares, Shawnees, Munseys, parts of the Senecas, residing in Pennsylvania, Cherokees, Catawbas, and other tribes, adhering to the English, with English traders, attacked the French and Indians. The latter had built a fort in which to protect and de fend themselves, and were able to withstand the siege, which lasted more than a week. Not long after this contest the Miamis retired to the Miami of the lake, at and near Fort Wayne, and never returned. The Shawnees took their place, and gave names to many towns in this part of Ohio. The northern part of Ohio belonged in ancient times to the Eries, who were exterminated by the * Howe's Collections. Five Nations in some of their wars.. The Wyan- dots, who, at the time the French missionaries came to America were dwelling in the peninsula of Michigan, were allowed by the Five Nations to occupy the land of the Eries, and thus came to dwell in Ohio. From Howe's Historical Collec- tions, it is ascertained that the Wyandots once oc- cupied the north site of the St. Lawrence river, down to Coon lake, and .from thence up the Uti- was. The Senecas owned the opposite side of the river, and the island upon which Montreal now stands. Both were large tribes, consisting of many thousands, and were blood relations, claiming each other as cousins. A war originated between the two tribes in the following manner: A Wyandot brave wanted a certain woman for his wife ; she objected ; said he was no warrior, as he had never taken any scalps. He then raised a party of warriors and they fell upon a small party of Senecas, killing and scalping a number of them. It is presumed the Wyandot brave secured his wife, but this created a war be- tween the tribes which lasted more than a hundred years, and until both nations were much weakened, and the Wyandots nearly exterminated. The lat- ter were compelled to leave the country, and took up their residence on the peninsula of Michigan, as before stated. They were often compelled to fight their old enemies even in this far off region, as war parties of Senecas frequently went there for that purpose. A peace was finally ar- ranged, and the remnant of Wyandots came to reside in Ohio. The Ottawas, another conquered tribe, and one allowed existence only by paying a kind of tribute to their conquerors, the Iroquois, were also part occupants of this same part of Ohio. This nation produced the renowned chief, Pontiac, who was the cause of such wide-spread desolation in the west. The Ottawas were often known as \"Canada Indians\" among the early settlers. Their principal settlements were on the Maumee, along the lake shore, on the Huron and Black rivers, and on the streams flowing into them. These Indians were distinguished for their cunning and artifice, and were devoid of the attributes of a true warrior. They were often employed as emis saries, their known diplomacy and artifice being well adapted for such business. The Wyandots,"], [209, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 201 on the other hand, were a bold, warlike people. General Harrison says of them: \"They were true warriors, and neither fatigue, famine, loss, or any of the ills of war could daunt their courage. They were our most formidable and stubborn ene mies among the aborigines in the war of 1812.\" They, like all tribes in the west, were oflen in fluenced by British rum and British gold, and found, in the end, as their chiefs so aptly expressed it, that they were \"only tools in the hands of a supe rior power, who cared nothing for them, only to further their own selfish ends.\" Many of the Indians of all these tribes were friendly to all whites until the breaking out of the war with Great Britain, when they left the country to join the forces of the king, and destroy the whites who occupied their country. They consid ered them then their enemies, and acted accord ingly on all occasions, save where personal friend ship, so strong in the Indian, developed itself, and in many instances, saved the lives of those in dan ger. Instances of this kind are frequently given, which appear in the narrative as they occurred. The manners, customs, feasts, war parties and daily life of these sons of the forest, form interest ing chapters in aboriginal history. It will be well to notice such in these pages, as far as space per mits. The character of the Indians was largely the result of their lives. They judged and lived by what the senses dictated. They had names and words for what they could hear, see, feel, taste and smell. They had no conceptions of abstract ideas until they learned such from the whites. Hence their language was very symbolical. They could see the sun in his brightness, they could feel his heat ; hence they compared the actions of a good man to the glory of the sun, and his fervent energy to the heat of that body. The moon in her brightness, the wind in its fury, the clouds in their majesty, or in their slow, graceful motion through a lazy atmosphere; the grace and flight of the deer; the strength and fury of the bear; the rush or ripple of water as it coursed along the bed of a river, all gave them words whose expressive ness are a wonder and marvel to this day. They looked on the beautiful river that borders the southern shores of our State and exclaimed \"O-he-zo!\" beautiful; on the placid waters of the stream bordering the western line of Indiana and ejaculated, \"Wa-ba\" \u2014 a summer cloud moving swiftly; on the river flowing into Lake Erie and said, \"Cuy-o-ga\" (Cuyahoga), crooked; and so on through their entire vocabulary, each name ex pressive of a meaning, full and admirably adapted to the object. At one time in the history of the Indians in the south, one tribe was driven from the homes of its ancestors, and in their flight they came to the green banks of a beautiful river. The spot was charmingly beautiful, and the chief, thrusting his spear into the earth, cried in a loud voice, \"Al-a-ba-ma\" \u2014 here we rest. A river and State now perpetuate the name and story. The Indians in Ohio, the tribes already men tioned, had learned a few things from their inter course with the whites on the borders of Western Pennsylvania, when they were first seen by the pioneers of Licking county. Their cabins or wig wams were of two kinds \u2014 circular and parallelo gram. The former, the true wigwam, was in use among the Ottawas when the whites came to their country. It was made of a number of straight poles driven firmly into the ground, their upper ends being drawn closely together; this formed a kind of skeleton tent. The squaws plaited mats of thongs, bark or grass, in such a manner as to render them impervious to water. These were spread on the poses, beginning at the bottom, and extending upward. A small hole was left for the egress of smoke from the fire kindled in the center of the wigwam. Around this fire, mats or skins were spread, on which the Indians slept at night, and on which they sat during the day. For a door, they lifted one end of the mat, and crept in, letting it fall down behind them. These tents were warm and dry, and generally quite free from smoke. Their fuel was nearly always split by the squaws in the fall of the year, and kept dry by placing it under an inverted birch-bark canoe. These wigwams were easily moved about from place to place, the labor of their destruction and construction being always performed by the squaws \u2014 the beasts of burden among all savage nations. The wigwam was* very light, and easily carried about. It resembled the tents of to-day in shape, and was often superior in points of comfort and protection."], [210, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 202 The cabins were more substantial affairs, and were built of poles, about the thickness of a small sized telegraph pole, but were of various sizes, and commonly, about twelve by fifteen feet in length. These poles were laid one on the other, similar to the logs in a cabin, save that, until the Indians learned that notching the point of contact near the end, from the whites, they were held by two stakes being driven in the angles formed in the corners, and fastened at the top by a hickory or bark withe, or by a thong of buckskin. The pen was raised to the height of from four to six feet, when an arched roof was made over it by driving at each end a strong post, with a fork at the upper end, which stood a convenient height above the top most log or pole. A stout pole was laid on the forks, and on this was laid a small pole reach ing down to the wall. On these rafters, small lath were tied, and over the whole pieces of linn bark were thrown. These were cut from the tree, often of great length, and from six to twelve inches in width. They were then cut into proper lengths to cover the cabin. At the ends of the cabin split timbers were set up, so that the entire cabin was inclosed except a small aperture at one end, left for a door. This was covered by a deer or bear skin. At the top of the cabin an opening was left for the smoke to escape, for all Indians built their fires on the ground in the centes of the cabin or wigwam, around which they spread skins and mats on which to recline and sleep. The cracks be tween the logs were filled with moss gathered from old logs. When made, the cabin was quite com fortable, and was often constructed in the same manner by the pioneers, while making improve ments, and used until a permanent structure could be erected. In regard to food, the Indians were more care ful to provide for their future needs than their suc cessors of the west are to-day. In the spring they made maple sugar by boiling the sap in large brass or iron kettles which they had obtained from the French and English traders. To secure the water they used vessels made of elm bark in a very inge nious manner. \"They would syip the bark,\" says Dr. George W. Hill, of Ashland, \"in the winter season when it would strip or run, by cutting down the tree, and, with a crooked stick, sharp and broad at one end, peel the bark in wide strips, from which they would construct vessels holding two or three gallons each.\" They would often make over a hundred of these. They cut a sloping notch in the side of a sugar-tree, stuck, a toma hawk into the wood at the end of the notch, and, in the dent thus made, drove a long chip or spile, which conveyed the water to the bark vessels. They generally selected the larger trees for tapping, as they considered the sap from such stronger and productive of more sugar. Their vessels for car rying the sap would hold from three to five gallons each, and sometimes, where a large camp was lo cated and a number of squaws at work, using a half-dozen kettles, great quantities of sugar would be made. When the sugar-water would collect faster than they could boil it, they would make three or four large troughs, holding more than a hundred gallons each, in which they kept the sap until ready to boil. When the sugar was made, it was generally mixed with bear's oil or fat, forming a sweet mixture into which they dipped their. roasted venison. As cleanliness was not a reigning virtue among the Indians, the cultivated taste of a civilized person would not always fancy the mixture, unless driven to it by hunger. The compound, when made, was generally kept in large bags made of coon skins, or vessels made of bark. The former were made by stripping the skin over the body toward the head, tying. the holes made by the legs with buckskin cords, and sewing securely the holes of the eyes, ears and mouth. The hair was all re moved, and then the bag blown full of air, from a hole in the upper end, and allowed to dry. Bags made in this way, Dr. Bushnell says, would hold whiskey, and were often used for such purposes. When they became saturated they were blown full of air again, the hole plugged, and they were left to dry. Sometimes the head was cut off without stripping the skin from it, and the skin of the neck gathered in folds like a purse, below which a string was tied and fastened with a pin. Skin vessels are not indigenous to the natives of America. All Oriental countries possess them, where the traveler of to-day finds them the rule. They are as old, almost, as time. The Indians inhabiting this part of Ohio were rather domestic in their tastes, and cultivated corn,"], [211, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 203 potatoes and melons. Corn was their principal crop, and was raised entirely by the squaws. When the season for planting drew near, the women cleared a spot of rich alluvial soil, and dug over the giound in a rude manner with their hoes. In planting the corn they followed lines, to a certain extent, thus forming rows each way across the field. When the corn began to grow, they cultivated it with wonderful industry, until it had matured suffi ciently for use. The corn-fields were nearly always in the vicinity of the villages, and sometimes were many acres in extent, and in favorable seasons yielded plentifully. The squaws had entire charge of the work. It was considered beneath the dig nity of a brave to do any kind of manual labor, and, when any one of them, or any of the white men whom they had adopted, did any work, they were severely reprimanded for acting like a squaw. The Indian women raised the corn, dried it, pounded it into meal in a rude stone mortar, or made it into hominy. Corn, in one form and an other, formed the chief staple of the Indian's food. They had various legends concerning its origin, which, in common with other stories, they were ac customed to recite in their assemblies. The indians were always fond of amusements of all kinds. These consisted of races, games of ball, throwing the tomahawk, shooting at a mark with the bow and arrow, or with the rifle after its distri bution among them, horse races, and other sports incidental to savage life. Their powers of endur ance were remarkable, and astonishing accounts are often now told of feats of prowess exhibited by these aborigines. Of the animals hunted by the Indians, none seems to have elicited their skill more than the bear. To slay one of these beasts was proof of a warrior's prowess, and dangerous encounters often resulted in the hunter's search for such distinction. The vitality of bruin was une qualed among the animals of the forest, and on this account, and because of the danger attached to his capture, made him an object of special hunts and feats of courage. \"The Black or Canesadooharie river,\" says \u00abDr. Hill, \"had always been famous among the aborigi nes of Ohio for the number and largeness of its bears. Some of the pioneers yet surviving often visited this country in search of bruin, when they first settled in the country, and can relate astound ing stories of their exploits at the time. The habit of these animals was to search out a hollow tree, or secure a warm clump of bushes late in the autumn, where they could remain three or four months, during the extreme cold of the winter, subsisting entirely on the fat of their bodies. They would emerge in the spring very lean, and when so were exceedingly ferocious. When searching out their places of winter solitude, they often left the impress of their feet on the bark of the tree they ascended, or on the grass in the lair they had found. The signs were easily discovered by Indians and expert bear hunters. They were then very fat, and were eagerly sought by the Indians for their flesh and fat. Sometimes they would ascend trees thirty or forty feet high, and find a good wintering place and take possession. Again they would ascend the tree, if hollow, from the inside, and, finding a good place, occupy it. Then the hunters would divide forces \u2014 one ascend the tree, and with a long pole, sharpened at one end, or wrapped with a rag or dry skin saturated with greese and set on fire, thrust the same down on the bear, and compel him to descend only to meet death at the foot of the tree from the arrow or bullet of the hunter below.\" The skin of a fat bear was a great prize to an Indian. It made him an excellent couch on which to sleep, or a cloak to wear. His flesh was sup posed to impart bravery to those who ate it, hence when dipped in sweetened bear's fat, it was con sidered an excellent dish and one often offered to friends. Venison, prepared the same way, was also considered a dish fit for the most royal visit ors ; a hospitality always extended to all who came to the camp, and if not accepted the donor was sure to be offended. The domestic life of the Indians was very much the same in all parts of America. Among the Northern Ohio tribes, marriage consisted simply of two persons agreeing to live together, which simple agreement among many tribes was never broken. Sometimes the young woman courted the young brave, much after the fashion of the white people during leap years. This custom was considered quite proper, and favorably looked upon by the braves. In some localities the chief gave away"], [212, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 204 the young woman to some brave he considered competent to support her by the chase, a part of the domestic economy always devolving on the man. When the game was killed, the squaw was expected to cut up and prepare the meat for use, and stretch and tan the hide. The marriage relation among the most of the tribes was held strictly by all, a variation from it on the part of the female meriting certain death. The Wyandots and Delawares prided themselves on their virtue and hospitality, and no authenticat ed case of the misuse of a female captive, except to treat them as prisoners of war, can now be quoted. They always evinced the utmost modesty toward their female captives. Respect for the aged, for parents and those in authority prevailed. When one among them spoke, all listened \u2014 never, under any circumstances, interrupting him. When he was done, then was the time to reply. In theology, the natives were all believers in one Great Spirit. They firmly believed in his care of the world and of his children, though different theories prevailed among the tribes regarding their creation. Their ideas of a divinity, as expressed by James Smith, a captive many years among them, are well given in the following story, pre served in Smith's memoir* He and his elder Indian brother, Tecaughre tanego, had been on a hunt for some time, and, meeting with poor success, found, themselves straitened for food. After they had smoked at their camp-fire awhile, Tecaughretanego delivered quite a speech, in which he recounted how Owaneeyo (God) had fed them in times gone by; how He fed the white people, and why they raised their own meat; how the Great Spirit provided the Indian with food for his use; and how, though the prospect was sometimes gloomy, the Great Spirit was only trying them; and if they would only trust Him and use the4means diligently, they would be certain to be provided for. The next morning Smith rose early, according to the Indian's instructions, and ere long killed a buffalo cow, whose meat kept them in food many days. This was the occasion of another speech from his Indian brother. This trust often led them to habits of prodigality. They seldom provided for the future, almost literally fulfilling the adage: \"Let each day provide for its own wants.\" They hunted, fished and idled away their days. Pos sessed of a boundless inheritance, they allowed the white race to come in and possess their lands and eventually drive them entirely away. Their man ner of feasts may also be noticed. The following description is from the pen of Dr. Hill, of Ashland, Ohio. The Mr. Copus mentioned is the same who was afterwards mur dered by the Indians. \"The ceremonies took place in the council-house, a building made of clapboards and poles, about thirty feet wide and fifty feet long. When the Indians entered the council-house, the squaws seated themselves on one side of the room, while the braves occupied the opposite sidei There was a small mound of earth in the center of the room, eight or ten feet in diame ter, which seemed to be a sort of sacrificial mound. The cere monies began with a sort of rude music, made by beating on a small brass kettle, and on dried skins stretched over the mouths of pots, making a kind of a rude drum. The pounding was accompanied by a sort of song, which, as near as can be un derstood, ran: 'Tinny, tinny, tinny, ho, ha, ho, ha, ho,' ac centing the last syllables. Then a chief arose and addressed them; during the delivery of his speech a profound silence pre vailed. The whole audience seemed to be deeply moved by the oration. The speaker seemed to be about seventy years of age, and was very tall and graceful. His eyes had the fire of youth, and shone with emotion while he was speaking. The andience seemed deeply moved, and frequently sobbed while he spoke. Mr. Copus could not understand the language of the speaker, but presumed he was giving a summary history of the Delaware nation, two tribes of which, the Wolf and the Turtle were represented at the feast. Mr. Copus learned that the speaker was the famous Captain Pipe, of Mohican Johnstown, the executioner of Colonel Crawford. At the close of the ad dress, dancing commenced. The Indians were clothed in deer skin leggings and English blankets. Deer hoofs and bears' claws were strung along the seams of their leggins, and when the dancecommenced, the jingling of the hoofs and claws made a sort of harmony to the rude music of the pots and kettles. The men danced in files or lines by themselves around the cen tral mound, the squaws following in a company by themselves. In the dance there seemed to be a proper modesty between the sexes. In fact the Greentown Indians were always noted for being extremely scrupulous and modest in the presence of one another. After the dance the refreshments, made by boiling venison and bear's meat, slightly tainted, together, were handed around. The food was not very palatable to the white persons present, and they were compelled to conceal it about their per sons until they had left the wigwam, when they threw the un savory morsels away. No greater insult could have been of fered the Indians than to have refused the proffered refreshments, hence a little deception was necessary to evade the censure of these untutored sons of the forest, whose stomachs could en tertain almost anything.\" A feast was held by these same Indians in 1811, a short time before the opening of the war of 181 2. It is belived to be the last one held in this"], [213, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 205 part of Ohio, as the war took away all the princi pal Indian characters. It was conducted very much as the one described \u2014 held in the fall of 1809. John Coulter, an old pioneer, recollects it very well, and, through Dr. Hill, gives a full de scription of it. Mr. Coulter says, that, while the food was cooking, an occasional morsel was thrown in the fire as an offering to the Great Spirit. Also, while the supper was being prepared, the chiefs, a large number of whom, from all parts of Ohio, were present, commenced to move around the mound in the center of the cabin, sometimes sing ing and sometimes delivering short speeches in their native tongue. While this was going on, the balance of the audience was arranged in lines two or three deep around the inside of the coun cil-house, which Henry Howe estimated, from nar ratives of pioneers given him in 1849, was sixty feet long, twenty-five feet wide, one story high, and inclosed by clapboards, or broad pieces of split lumber. This difference in size may be accounted for by the fact that two persons looking at a build ing will very seldom make the same estimate of its size. The singing of the Indians at this second feast was a low kind of melancholy wail, accom panied by a sort of grunt, contortions of the face and singular gesticulations of the arms. The In dians were dressed as those described in the feast of 1809, and, though Mr. Coulter could not un derstand their language, he thought it was either a recital of their history or portended war. The ceremonies lasted two or three hours, when the provisions were handed around, and general hand-shaking and congratulations followed, closing the feast. The Indians did not all disappear from this part of Ohio for many years after the advent of the whites. They often came to Newark to trade. They would gather under the forest trees in the public square, and there talk, smoke, trade, or idle away their time as suited their fancy. Physically they were sometimes the finest specimens of mankind. Tall, straight as an arrow, unexceptional physique, clad only in leggins and breech-clout, they exhib ited a physical body, one could not tire contem plating. Sometimes they would get drunk, when they were a little dangerous. They traded peltry for hatchets, powder and ball, and trinkets of various kinds. By practice they became as sharp in bar gains as the white traders and peddlers. Experi ence taught them to rely on their own judgment in all such matters. By the treaty of September 29, 181 7, the Dela wares were deeded a reservation on the south of the Wyandot reservation, both in Marion and Wyandot counties. When this was done, Captain Pipe, son of \"Old Captain Pipe,\" was the princi pal Delaware chief. The Delaware Indians re mained on their reservation until about 1829, when they ceded it to the United States for three thousand dollars, and moved west of the Missis sippi. The Wyandots ceded theirs in March, 1842, and left for the far west in July of the next year. At that date they numbered about seven hundred souls, and were the last Indian tribe to relinquish its claims to the soil of Ohio."], [214, "CHAPTER XXIII. FIRST WHITE MEN.

This trail led to the reservoir, a portion of which is within the county of Licking. Captain Gist reached it and camped upon its border, as his written journal shows, January 17, 1751, and on \"the next day,\" continues the journal, he \"set out from the great swamp.\" This trail, in all proba bility crossed the Licking at or near the mouth of Bowling Green run, about four miles east of New ark. Mr. John Larabee, who settled on the south side of the Licking in 1801, near the mouth of Bowling Green run, and a few years thereafter purchased a farm three miles east of Newark, found said trail still traceable on his land. Andrew Montour, son of a Seneca chief and of the famous Catharine Montour, a Canadian woman; also Mr. George Croghan, a commissioner to treat with the Indian tribes on behalf of Pennsylvania, joined Captain Christopher Gist at the Indian vil lage of Muskingum, situated between the Tusca rawas and Walhonding rivers, not far from their junction (Coshoeton), and accompanied him to the old Indian towns on the Big Miami river. From the latter point Gist passed into Kentucky. He was a noted character, a man of mark, a nat ural leader, and a heroic adventurer. The year following his passage through this county (1752), he with eleven other families established a settle ment between the Monongahela and Youghio gheney rivers in western Pennsylvania. He was an intimate friend and companion of the then youthful Washington, and served as his guide while on the perilous mission under the authority of Governor Dinwiddie, to the French command- ant on the Ohio and Allegheny rivers. \"How dolefully the night-hawk screams in the heavens, How dismally gibbers the gray coyote.\" \u2014 Joaquin Miller. TJIOLLOWING the Mound Builders and the In- L dians came the superior race to occupy the soil of Licking county. The first permanent settlement of the county was made in 1798; prior to that, however, a few white men either passed across, or occupied, for a short time, this territory. These may be noticed so far as history gives any account of them. Christopher Gist was the first, so far as known. This hardy pioneer first set foot on the virgin soil of Licking in 1751. He was exploring in the in terest of a Virginia land company. Anterior to his advent, and during long ages of pre-historic times, the Indian was probably the sole and unmo lested human occupant. Two brothers of General Washington and other prominent Virginia gentlemen of that day were members of the land company represented by Captain Gist, and in whose interest his exploration was made. This company had heard of the rich lands west of the Ohio, but they knew little of this great dark wilderness, except that it was occupied by savage tribes. Gist started upon the Indian trail at the forks of the Ohio (Pittsburgh), and followed it to the forks of the Muskingum (Coshoeton) and from there, by way of Wakatomika (Dresden), and King Beavers town, which stood on the dividing ridge between the waters of the Hock-Hocking and Scioto, at a point about equi-distant between the present cities of Lancaster and Columbus, to the old Indian 206"], [215, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 207 Washington once recommended him as a proper person to appoint to the office of Indian agent, and said that he knew \"of no person so well quali fied for it as Captain Gist.\" And further \"that he had extensive dealings with the Indians, is in great esteem among them, well acquainted with their manners and customs, indefatigable and pa tient \u2014 most excellent qualities where Indians are concerned. As to his capacity, honesty and zeal, I dare venture to engage.\" Such, in brief, is the story of the first white oc cupation of the county. Two-thirds of the average years of human life passed away after Gist's tramp across the county, before it was honored by the presence of a second white man. This was an eccentric character known as \"Chaplain Jones,\" and he was accom panied by a man named David Duncan, an Indian trader. These two gentlemen, in 1773, traveled eastward from the Shawnee towns on the Scioto, along the Indian trail of the Licking valley which had been followed by Captain Gist. Duncan was from Shippensburgh, Pennsylvania, and was on his way to Fort Pitt, probably for goods. Rev. David Jones was on his return jour ney to Freehold, Monmouth county, New Jersey, from the Indians on the Scioto, among whom he had been as missionary, by authority of the Philadel phia Baptist association, of which he was a member. He kept a diary of this journey, from which these facts are taken. This diary shows that he followed a trail that led from the Indian towns on the Scioto, to \"Stand ing Stone\" (Lancaster), where, in the language of the diary, \"was an Indian town consisting chiefly of Delmeares, and which was situated on a creek called Hock-Hockin. It appears muddy, is not wide, but soon admits of large canoes.\" He did not arrive at Standing Stone until nearly nine o'clock at night, and says \"that his road was very small, and the night dark in this wide wilderness, which made traveling more disagreeable than can be easily expressed.\" Wednesday, February 10, 1773, they \"set out early in the morning \u2014 our course more northerly than northeast \u2014 the land chiefly low and level, and where our horses broke through the frost, it might be called bad road and good land. No inhabi- tants by the way. Before night, came to a small town consisting of Delawares and Shawnees. About a mile before we came to this town we crossed a clear large stream, called Salt Lick creek [doubtless Licking river, four miles east of New ark] which empties into the Muskingum.\" The town above mentioned was doubtless the Indian village situated on the Bowling Green, five miles east of Newark, which yet existed twenty years later, when Judge Elliott, father of the late Benjamin Elliott, of Newton township, was located there as Indian trader. The diary says, \"the country here appeared calculated for health, fertile and beautiful.\" Next day, \"after paying a high price for the corn our horses consumed, we started for the Moravian towns on the Tuscarawas.\" This \"Chaplain Jones\" was born of Welsh parents, on White Clay Creek Hundred, New castle county, Delaware, May 12, 1736. He was licensed to preach by the Welsh Tract church in 1 76 1, and ordained at Freehold, Monmouth county, New Jersey, December 12, 1766, and re mained pastor at that place until he started on his missionary tour to the Indians of the northwest. In 1775 he became pastor of the Great Valley church, in Chester county, Pennsylvania, but re signed the following year on being appointed chaplain of Colonel (afterwards General) Arthur St. Clair's regiment, raised for service in the Revo lution. He was on duty with his regiment at Ti conderoga, and served in two campaigns under Major General Gates. In 1777 he served as brig ade chaplain under General Wayne. At the close of the war he retired to a farm in Chester county. In 1789 he again visited the northwest, and January 13, 1790, preached the first sermon ever preached in the Miami country, at Columbia, six miles above Cincinnati. He was chaplain in Wayne's army during his campaign against the In dians, and in 181 2, though seventy-six years old, he again entered the army as chaplain, and served under Generals Brown and Wilkinson until the close of the war. This ended his public career. He was afterward a large contributor to the Phil adelphia press on public affairs. He officiated in public for the last time Septem ber 26, 1817, when he delivered an address at the dedication of the monument erected at Paoli,"], [216, "208 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. an Indian village, situated a mile or more above Johnstown, in Monroe township. Their route, it may be observed, passed through the Indian village on the Bowling Green, before mentioned. Sometime after his capture, Billy Dragoo was adopted by an Ottawa chief, with whom he re mained a number of years, enduring all the hardships and vicissitudes incident to Indian life. He became an excellent hunter, and was engaged as such while the chief with whom he lived, and the other sava ges of the tribe, were engaged in their victorious campaign against St. Clair. Subsequently Billy married an Indian woman, and became a thorough Indian in habits, customs and inclination. The bridge of his nose was bored, and his ears slit pre paratory to wearing the usual ornaments. He lived with his Indian wife until 1808, when there had been born to them four children, and for this family he had procured, up to that time, a precari ous subsistence by fishing and hunting. About this time his brother, hearing of his whereabouts, visited him and obtained from him a promise that within forty days he would revisit his father and kinsmen, yet residing in Monongahela county. This promise was kept, and he passed through this county by way of the valley of the North fork, re maining over night in the small tavern kept by the first settler of the county, Captain Elias Hughes, on the farm afterward owned by William Weis, north of Vannattaburgh. The next day, accom panied by an Indian, his wife's brother, he passed through Newark, spending the nigr.t at the house of another of his brothers, who lived near the present site of Irville, Muskingum county. He then had suspended from his nose a half-moon sil ver ornament, wore large rings in his ears, and up on other parts of his person were other Indian trappings. He was at least half Indian, and could readily have laid aside the little remnant of civili zation that yet adhered to him. Twenty-four years had elapsed since he was captured and carried away from the friends he was now going to visit. At Irville two brothers and a brother-in-law joined him, and the four journeyed in company to meet his father. The latter, on hearing of his approach, could not await his arrival, but set out to meet him on the road. His friends and neighbors to the number of forty or more joined him, and the cav- Chester county, Pennsylvania, commemorative of the Americans who were massacred therein 1777. He died February 20, 1820, in his eighty-fourth year, and was buried at the Great Valley Baptist church. He often visited his countrymen on the \"Welsh Hills,\" near Granville, in his missionary tours. Howe states that \"the first Baptist sermon was preached in the log church (in Granville), by Elder Jones in 1806.\" This was probably Chap lain Jones. He is yet remembered by a few of the early pioneers as a kind, companionable gentleman, of rare eccentricities, who always wore the queue, the breeches, the shoe and knee buckles, the cockade and military toggery, of high rank chaplain in the service; and as a gentleman of the \"Old School.\" The third white man to press the soil of Licking, was \"Billy\" Dragoo, who afterward became a permanent resident of the county. His first visit to this county was in 1786, under peculiar cir cumstances. In October of that year, Mrs. Dragoo and her son, William, a lad of twelve years, were gathering vegetables in their garden in Monongahela county, now West Virginia, when a party of savages rushed upon them from an adjoining thicket, and made them prisoners. The mother was placed upon a horse that had been stolen in the neighbor hood, and the party started in the direction of the Ohio river. On the third day of their captivity and before the river was reached, the horse rode by Mrs. Dragoo fell, and injured her severely, whereupon the Indians tomahawked and scalped her ; and often during the remainder of the jour ney to the Indian towns on Mad river, exhibited the scalp as a trophy, before their heart-broken captive boy. At the Ohio they were, overtaken by another party of marauders, who had a number of stolen horses, and thereafter the captive was fur nished a horse on the march. The Ohio was crossed three miles below Fishing creek, and the Muskingum, at the mouth of the Licking (Zanesville). They followed the Licking valley to the junction of the North and South forks of that stream (Newark), and then pursued the Indian trail up Raccoon creek, passing through Raccoon town, which, until 1807, was known as"], [217, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 209 alcade of excited and interested people traveled fifteen miles before meeting the long lost son. No pen or pencil can adequately picture such a meet ing. Remaining two months with his father and friends, Billy returned again to his wife and half breed children, on his way again spending the night with Elias Hughes. Two years afterward (1810) Billy Dragoo re solved to abandon Indian life and its degradations, and spend the remainder of his days in the enjoy ment of the blessings of civilization. Taking two of his children, aged two and ten, respectively, he returned to Monongahela county and spent five years with his father and brothers. These two children subsequently rejoined their mother. Dragoo married again, in 1815, and raised an other family of children. In 1823 he removed to Perry township, this county, where he resided until his death \u2014 about thirty years ago. Two of his daughters yet reside in Perry township. He never wholly abandoned his half civilized habits and mode of life, but continued until his death to spend most of his time fishing and hunt ing. He was a quiet, peaceable, inoffensive man, and was greatly esteemed^for his many excellent qualities. The next white man to enter the limits of Licking county was Captain Samuel Brady, the noted scout and Indian fighter, with a party of hunters and scouts under his direction. The exact date of this expedition has not been ascertained, but it must have been about 1792, or possibly a year later. The facts here given, pertaining to this scouting party, are upon the authority of four gentlemen of credibility, namely : Messrs. Hamilton, Simms and Darrah, who afterward settled in Muskingum county, and Mr. Jonathan Evans, who located near the Ohio river, below Marietta, all four having been members of the expedition. In interviews with the above named scouts, by Rev. C. Springer, more than half a century ago, as well as during subsequent years (the three first named being his near neighbors and friends), the objects or purposes of the expedition were de clared to be \"to ascertain the condition of the more or less hostile Indians of the Muskingum and some of its tributaries, to learn the state of their feelings toward the border settlers, and inci- dentally to chastise such small hunting or maraud ing bands as might fall in their way.\" . The members of the expedition crossed the Ohio river at Wheeling, and directed their course to the forks of the Muskingum, at the junction of the Tuscarawas and 'Walhonding rivers (Coshoeton). From there they moved up the Walhonding to the mouth of Kokosing or Owl creek, now called Ver non river. This stream they followed until they came to a point north of and near the headwaters of the Licking (probably the present site of Mt. Vernon), when they turned south and followed down the valley of the north fork of Licking to its junction with the south fork at Newark. From here they continued down the Licking four or five miles, until they reached the level plat of natural prairie, extending a mile or more along the river. Captain Brady was greatly enamored of the beautiful lawn which here presented itself to his view. To him it resembled a well-remem bered spot in Virginia known as \"Bowling Green.\" He therefore called it Bowling Green, and by this name it is yet known. The contiguous locality, in early times known as'\"Montour's Point,\" is now seldom mentioned, but \"Bowling Green\" is a very familiar name. The expedition, being composed of frontiers- men who expertly used the rifle, provisioned itself from day to day upon the game of the forest. On reaching the falls of Licking, four miles from the Muskingum, it was found expedient to spend a day in hunting. \"Near evening\" writes Rev. C. Springer, \"all the men had returned to camp but Jonathan Evans. After waiting in suspense for some time, they gave their usual signal for lost persons \u2014 firing their guns \u2014 but no response came from Jonathan; and as they had that day discovered fresh Indian signs, they had little doubt that he was captured. Apprehending danger to themselves, they, for greater security, passed around the hill immedi- ately southeast of Dillon's old furnace, where they lay concealed during the night. In the morning they resumed their march down stream,- not deem- ing it safe to remain longer, although Evans had not rejoined them, and soon reached the present site of Zanesville. They continued down the river, but before reaching the mouth of Moxahala"], [218, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 2IO creek they, to their great joy, found Evans. He had strayed away, got lost, in fact, and remained all night upon an elevated point of land on the bank of the Moxahala, a few miles above its mouth. This stream was therefore named by Brady \"Jonathan's creek,\" and by that name it has gen erally been known since, and appears under that name in maps, gazetteers and histories. After the restoration of Jonathan Evans to the expedition, they constructed bark canoes, in which they descended the Muskingum to Marietta. In passing over the rapids, nine or ten miles be low the falls of the Muskingum, the canoe of an Irishman named Duncan was wrecked and him self thrown into the stream, from which he was rescued with but little difficulty. Thereupon those rapids were called \"Duncan's Falls,\" and have ever since borne that name. Thus the men of Captain Brady's expedition gave names to two important places on their line of march, and its commander very happily named another interesting locality in the vicinity of Newark, which names continue to be recognized by authors and historians. So far as known, the last man to visit the pres ent territory of Licking county, before the first settlement was made, was a gentleman afterward known as \"Judge Elliott.\" The Indian village on the Bowling Green, sev eral times referred to in this chapter, was the scene of Judge Elliott's operations. He was a bold, adventurous, enterprising young Pennsyl vanian, who brought with him a stock of goods and became an \"Indian trader.\" He was the father of the late Benjamin Elliott, who lived three miles north of Newark, in Newton township. The point of high land that juts out into the first bottom of the Licking valley, and upon which stands the mansion of Charles Mont gomery, close by the Bowling Green run, was in early times known as \"Montour's Point,\" named in honor of the half-breed, Andrew Montour, before mentioned. Upon this spot Elliott estab lished himself in a hut, or wigwam, for money making purposes, as a dealer in such goods as he might be able to trade to the Indians for fur and peltry. He might be called the first white settler within the limits of Licking county, although he was not allowed to remain, as will be seen. Just what date Elliott became a resident of this Indian village is not known, but it must have been before Wayne's treaty of 1795, as .will be manifest by the following account of the manner in which his mercantile venture terminated. After that treaty, Indian traders were not molested in their occupation. One day a friendly squaw, in whose veracity Elliott' had the utmost confidence, informed him of a plot concocted by the Indians, to take his scalp and appropriate to themselves his effects. Realizing the situation at a glance, he hastily gathered up his most valuable goods, and secretly mounting his horse, made all possible speed on the most direct trail to the settlements beyond the Ohio river. He had been gone but a short time when the discovery was made by the savages, who at once started in pursuit, and did not abandon it until they arrived at the Ohio river, reaching it just in time to see Elliott on the opposite bank, under the protec tion of the white settlers. The Indians confiscated the goods he was com pelled to leave behind at the \"Point,\" but failed to get his scalp; albeit he was never afterwards very familiar with them, and never resumed his trading operations this side of the river. He was, prob ably, the first merchant within the county limits. When in subsequent years the trader of Mon tour's Point was known, he was a citizen of Hun tingdon county, Pennsylvania, and a member of the county court. At least as early as 1805, Judge Elliott was a large land holder in what is now Newton township. Although a frequent visitor to the county, he never became a permanent settler here. . He laid out the second village in the county in 1805. It was located upon his land, where the Mt. Vernon road crosses the Brushy fork, three miles north of Newark, and on the south bank of that stream. He gave it the name of \"Fairfield,\" but it ultimately became known as \"Canonspurgh,\" in honor of Thomas Canon, the tavern-keeper of the village. It contained a few houses at one time, but they were primitive in style. After a time, there being no prospect that it would become a"], [219, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 211 town, it was vacated and the lots annexed to the contiguous cornfields. Judge Elliott's village had its birth in Licking township, Fairfield county; its death took place in Newton township, Licking county. He spent many of the years of his early life in the west, and in his business operations displayed much daring and enterprise. He owned lands convenient to the \"Big Spring,\" sometimes called the \"Spencer Spring;\" and upon the stream that rises from the spring, and near its entrance into the North fork, he built a saw-mill in 1814. Judge Elliott was one of a numerous family con nection, composed of men of energy and more than ordinary ability. His brother, Colonel Robert Elliott, was a contractor in the army, was ambuscad ed and killed by Indians near Cincinnati in 1794. Commodore Elliott, who participated, as second in command, in Perry's victory on Lake Erie, and was conspicuously identified with the American navy until 1845, was his nephew. In the war of the Rebellion, some of his descendants were con spicuous in the navy, acting an honorable part, and rendering the name famous. The following incident is given on the authority of B. C. Woodward, esq., to whom it was related by Mr. Jennings Crawford, of Iowa, a son of the Crawford below mentioned: Shortly after the treaty of Greenville, rumors of peace reached Wheeling, and to ascertain the truth, the commandant of the post at that place dispatched six men, belonging to Samuel Brady's company of scouts, in the direction of Sandusky. This party was made up of skilled backwoodsmen, among whom were Crawford and one of the Wet zels. They crossed the Muskingum at Dresden, came across to the Licking river, up which they travelled to the present site of Newark. Here they turned north along the North fork, and after going a short distance beyond the site of Mt. Vernon, they became satisfied that Indians were watching them with hostile intent, and turned back. Following the route they came, they en camped for the night about fourteen miles west of the present site of Dresden, in the eastern part of what is now Licking county, and not far from the line of Muskingum county \u2014 probably on the farm owned by the late Jocob Frees. In this camp they were fired upon by Indians, in the night; one of the party killed and one wounded. They scattered and made their way separately, the best they could, to Wheeling. Mr. Crawford afterward returned, with a companion, and buried the dead man. If the account of this affair be correct, this was probably the first death of a white man that oc curred within the limits of Licking county. The expedition ended the invasion of Licking county by white men until 1796-7, when the sur veyors, in the employ of the government, came into Licking valley to \"spy out the land.\" They were accompanied by Elias Hughes, in the capacity of hunter and guide, and it was at this time that he made the discovery of the beauty and desira bility of the valley of the Licking. Two years after, in the year 1798, he returned to this valley with his family, and became the first settler of the county."], [220, "CHAPTER XXIV. THE FIRST PIONEERS.

B. Clark. TN the preceding chapter, a history of the white _L occupation of the territory embraced within the limits of Licking county, has been brought down to the year 1798, at which date the first permanent settlers, Hughes and Ratliff, arrived. It is neces sary and proper here to give brief biographical sketches of a few of the most prominent of the early pioneers, whose lives are necessarily a part of the early history of this county. The acts, achievements and exploits of individual character are history. This is pre-eminently true of the first settlers of a country \u2014 the pioneers. Especially is it true in such a country as this was, where the subjugation of the hostile tribes was the condition precedent to its permanent settlement. The pioneers of Licking county made its early history. Elias Hughes and John Ratliff remained here until their death, hence their names are as much interwoven in the history of Licking county, as is the name of George Washington with the history of the United States, or as are the names of General Grant and Abraham Lincoln with the history of the late Rebellion. Elias Hughes was born near the south branch of the Potomac, a section of country which furnished Licking county with many of its first settlers and most useful citizens. His birth occurred some time before Braddock's defeat in 1755. Of his early life little is known until 1774, when he is found in the army of General Lewis, engaged in the battle of Point Pleasant. General Lewis commanded the left wing of the army of Lord Dunmore, then governor of Virginia, and successfully fought the distinguished Shawnees chief, Cornstalk, who had a large force of Indians under his command. One-fifth of Lewis' com mand was killed or wounded, but Elias Hughes escaped unhurt in this hard-fought battle, which lasted an entire day. At the time of his death, which occurred more than seventy years after the battle, he was, and had been for years, the sole survivor of that sanguinary conflict. Hughes is next found a resident of Harrison county, Virginia, where his chief employment dur ing the twenty-one years that intervened between the battle of Point Pleasant, and the treaty of Greenville in 1795, was that of a scout or spy on the frontier settlements near to and bordering on the Ohio river. This service which, with him, was a labor of love, he rendered at the instance of his State, and of the border settlers who had been, for a long time, greatly harrassed by Indians. Hughes' father, and others of his kindred, and also a young woman to whom he was betrothed, were massacred by them. These acts of barbarity made him ever after an unrelenting and merciless enemy of the Indians, and in retaliation for their numerous butcheries, his deadly rifle was brought to bear fatally upon many of them."], [221, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 2I3 It is but an act of justice to the memory of this pioneer settler, who was well known as an Indian hater and an Indian slayer, that the provocation he had be clearly stated and properly understood. Born and reared on the frontier, among rude, un lettered people; untaught and wholly uncultivated as he was, it is not surprising that under all these circumstances of horrid aggravation, he should have given rather full play to strong and malignant passions, and that he should have cherished even to old age, the more harsh and somewhat malign ant feelings of his nature. This he did fully, so long as the Indian tribes sustained a hostile attitude toward the whites. A word here in reference to a matter well re membered by the old settlers. In 1820 an Indian squaw of the Stockbridge tribe was shot near the county line, between Utica and Martinsburgh. She was taken to Mt. Vernon where she died. One McLane shot her, and -was sent to the peni tentiary for it. He and four others named Mc- Daniel, Evans, Chadwick and Hughes (not Elias), were engaged in chopping, when this squaw and others of the tribe came along and camped near them. The diabolical proposition was made and accepted, that they should play cards, and that the loser should shoot her. McLane was the loser, and did the shooting. His confederates, or at least some of them, were tried and acquitted. In Norton's history of Knox county it is stated that \"Hughes shot this squaw, simply to gratify his hatred of the Indian race.\" How an intelligent man, writing history could justify himself for mak ing such a gross mistake, regarding a matter on which he could easily get correct information from a thousand residents of this county and of Knox, it is hard to conceive. Elias Hughes had neither part nor lot in the matter, directly or remotely; but condemned the outrage in unmeasured terms. He was not guilty, and this emphatic denial is deemed an act of simple justice to Mr. Hughes. Indian hostilities were terminated by the treaty of Greeriville in 1795, and Hughes' services as a scout were no longer required; he therefore sur rendered his commission as captain of scouts, and directed his thoughts to more pacific pursuits. He had been commissioned by that distinguished fron tiersman, Colonel Ben Wilson, the father of Dan- iel D. Wilson and Mrs. Dr. Brice, both of this county. In 1796, Hughes entered, in the capacity of hunter, the service of a surveying party, who were about to engage in running the range lines of lands lying in what is now Licking county. This party was probably under the direction of John G. Jack son, deputy surveyor under General Rufus Put nam, surveyor general of the United States. The fine bottom lands on the Licking were thus brought to the notice of Hughes, and he resolved to leave his mountain home and \"go west.\" Accordingly in the spring of 1797 he gathered together his effects, and with his wife and twelve children, made their way on foot and on pack-horses to the mouth of Licking. This point was made accessi ble to horse-back travelers and footmen by the lo cation and opening, the year before, by Zane and others, the road from Wheeling to Maysville; and also of a road previously cut from Marietta up the river. John Ratliff, a nephew of Hughes, with a wife and four children, came with him,. in the same manner, to the mouth of the Licking. Here they remained one year, and in the spring of 1798, both families, numbering twenty-one persons, came in the same manner up the Licking and settled on what is called the \"Bowling Green,\" on the banks of the Licking, four miles east of Newark, a short distance above the mouth of Bowling Green run. This was the first permanent white settlement within the present limits of Licking county. They found the \"Bowling Green,\" a level untim bered, green lawn or prairie, and they at once pro ceeded to raise a crop of corn. Whether the Bowling Green was a natural prairie, or had been cleared by the Indians, remains an unsettled ques tion. Their nearest neighbors for two years, lived near Nashport, a distance of ten miles. One of these was Philip Barrick, who in 1801 moved into this county. This colony of twenty-one persons was subsisted mainly on the meat of wild animals, procured by the rifles of the settlers, although vegetables and a considerable corn crop were raised the first season. For many years bear, deer, wild turkeys, and a great variety of smaller game were in such abun dance as to supply the full demands of the settlers."], [222, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 214 Fruits, berries, and other spontaneous productions of the earth, also contributed many years, in no inconsiderable degree to the subsistance of the settlers, as did, also, the fish\"in the streams. Ratliff, in some particulars, was a different style of man from Hughes. He was much more in clined to the peaceful avocations of life, and for one reared on the frontier, had not been largely engaged in border warfare ; though he as well as Hughes, was considerably devoted to the chase, to fishing, trapping, bee-hunting, as well as to killing wild animals generally. In 1801 two Indians came to the Bowling Green and stole four horses belonging to Hughes, Ratliff, Weedman, a recent immigrant, and a Mr. Bland, living at the mouth of the Licking, but who was, at this time, visiting Hughes. In the morning, find ing their horses missing, the owners determined to pursue and kill the thieves, strongly suspecting the Indians. Hughes, Ratliff, and Bland armed them selves and started in pursuit. Weedman, for some reason, was not of the party. They were enabled to follow the trail, readily tracking them through the grass and weeds, and, overtaking them on the waters of Owl creek, shot them. Bland's flint did not strike fire, but Hughes' and Ratliff's did, and the Indians stole no more horses. When the In dians were overtaken, and it was evident the horses would be recovered, Bland and Ratliff re lented, and suggested to Hughes to let the thieves escape with their lives, but the latter was not that kind of a man. He remonstrated in such em phatic terms, using such forcible expletives as to bring his associates to his way of thinking. When Hughes said a thing must be done, and he could do it or cause it to be done, it was done. In this case he had his way, and the Indian horse-thieves paid the forfeit. Hughes knew them, and believed them to have been engaged in stealing horses, and returning them to their owners for a compensation in skins and furs. This sanguinary transaction necessitated the erection of a block-house on the Bowling Green, as a protection against the friends of the horse thieves, who were greatly incensed against the white settlers for killing them; but it never became necessary to defend it. Bland removed from Pendleton county, Virginia, in 1798, with a wife and four children, coming two hundred miles over the mountains on pack horses, to Marietta, following bridle paths and In dian trails a portion of the way. On reaching the mouth of the Licking he took refuge with his family in a sugar camp. Before he had time to erect a cabin, he had born to him in this sugar camp, a son, whom they rocked in a sugar trough, the only cradle at hand. Mr. Silas Bland, one of the pioneers of Perry township, was this child of the sugar trough. The elder Bland, no less than his fellow fron tiersmen, Hughes and Ratliff, possessed all the constituent elements of a first class pioneer; and, after acting well his part, he died in Muskingum county. In 1S02 Elias Hughes was elected captain of the first company of militia raised within the pres ent limits of the county. This company he com manded a number of years. The drills of the battalion, to which this company belonged were held at Lancaster. Hughes had four children born to him on the Bowling Green, making the whole number sixteen, only one of whom, Jonathan, yet remains in the county. Ratliff's wife died in 1802, and, probably, was the second adult white person,* and the first white settler to die within the present limits of this county; the only probable exception being that of Mrs. Jones, who died about the same time on the farm afterward owned by General Munson, in Granville township, four miles west of Newark. Her husband, John Jones, had erected the first cabin in that township, being the one in which she died. Ratliff married again, his second wife being the daughter of a pioneer by the name of Stateler, who lived near the mouth of Rocky fork. He also raised quite a family, but none of them now live \u2014 if living at all \u2014 in this county. He had a son in the war of 1812, who, after his return from the army, removed to Louisiana. Ratliff finally moved to the south side of the Licking, near the mouth of the Brushy fork, where he died about the year 1811. Neither he nor Hughes seem to have had much success in acquiring prop *See chapter on \"First White Men,\" for first death in county."], [223, "HISTORY OF LICKING. COUNTY. 2IS erty \u2014 there is no evidence that either of them had much ambition in that direction. Elias Hughes, on all other subjects except In dian warfare, was regarded as of a silent, taciturn disposition, but he was fond of relating his exploits and successes as a scout, and would sometimes sit up whole nights to relate, to willing listeners, his hair-breadth escapes and adventures, the thrilling stories and heroic acts and deeds of renown, in which he had borne .a part. He was unassuming, generally mild-mannered, unpretending, unambi tious, but firm, determined, unyielding; and when he resolved on a certain line of conduct, he gen erally pursued it to success or failed only after vig orous effort. Fond of adventure, he displayed in border warfare, in battle, in the pursuit of Indians, the energy, bravery, and self-sacrificing and heroic virtues that belonged so pre-eminently to the early pioneers of the great west. In the war of 1812, notwithstanding his age, being about sixty years old, he volunteered for the defence of Fort Meigs. Oh the formation of a company in Newark, he was selected to conduct the men to headquarters, at Worthington, for or ganization. At the election of company officers he was made lieutenant, while the late General John Spencer was elected captain. Three of his sons were also engaged in the war; of 1812, one of whom contracted a disease from which he died. Mr. Hughes lived many years on the North fork, a few miles above Newark, and also several years at Clinton, in Knox county, from whence he removed to Monroe township, near Johnstown. In 1827 his wife died, and most of his children having married and moved from the county, he became an inmate of the house of his son Jona than, who is yet living in the county at the age of eighty-four. Jonathan was born in Virginia in 1796, and was a mere infant when his father reached the mouth of Licking (1797). When, in 1798, the family removed to Bowling Green, he was put into one end of a salt-sack, with an opening for his head, and his brother, David, two years older, in the other end. The sack was, on their daily march, slung across a pack-saddle, and in this manner the only survivor of the twenty-one made his advent at the Bowling Green. For many years Elias Hughes was a pensioner, regularly receiving from a benificent government an amount of money that enabled him to spend his declining years in the full enjoyment of all the necessaries of life, kindly ministered unto by his son and family, with whom he spent the last sev enteen years of his life in the quiet village of Utica. His life was filled with experiences more diver sified than usually falls to the lot of man. He always met adversity, and the stern realities of life uncomplainingly and like a man. Enduring, as he did, for the last sixteen years of his life, the terri ble affliction of total blindness, he was deprived of much enjoyment, but he was resigned and patient, thus exhibiting his courage and manhood to the last. His mind turned upon religious matters in these latter years, and he cherished hopes of a happy future. He died in December, 1844, and was buried with military honors and other demonstrations of respect. His age is not certainly known, but it is sup posed that he was more than ninety years old. Such was the life, briefly sketched, of one of the most remarkable of the pioneers of this county. It was a life full of privation, adventure, hardship, toil, exposure and excitement, preserved through all to an unusual length. The two families of Hughes and Ratliff, and that of a man named John Carpenter, of which little or nothing is known, were the sole occupants of the territory now constituting this county, at the close of the last century. Early in the spring of the opening year (1800) of the present century, three more families, Greens, Pitzers and Van Bus kirks were added to the number. In August, Isaac Stadden and family came, making the seventh ; and in September, Captain Samuel Elliott and family arrived, constituting the eighth. The marriage of Colonel John Stadden and Betsey, daughter of the aforesaid Green, which took place on Christmas day, 1800, made the ninth family, which was the whole number in this territory when the year closed. In the spring of 1799, Benjamin Green, a revo lutionary soldier, and his son-in-law, Richard Pit zer, left Alleghany county, Maryland, to settle in the Northwest Territory. On reaching the neigh-"], [224, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 2l6 Mr. Van Buskirk was a stout, active, resolute man, a woodsman of the first order, frequently ac companying such chieftains as Captain Samuel Brady and John McCullocri in their expeditions against the Indians. He acted well his part as a faithful, ever ready, efficient pioneer on the fron tier of Virginia, in giving protection to the settlers that were endeavoring to establish themselves in permanent homes on both sides of the Ohio, dur ing the twenty years of Indian warfare ; his resi dence being at, or near, the mouth of Buffalo creek, in Brooke county, Virginia. Those were years of fierce conflict, murderous warfare, barbar ity, blood and carnage. He remained on his farm at the South fork until 1804, when he removed to Newark and rebuilt the Petticord and Belt mills, which he run persistently, much more to the benefit of the public than him self, until near his death. He died on the last day of December, 1840, at the age of almost eighty-five years. He was, in the early part of his eventful life, a man of great enterprise and force of character, and while living on the frontier, in common with his fellow fron tiersmen, endured many hardships, and had many hair-breadth escapes from marauding Indians in his conflicts with them.. As a spy, he was invaluable, and scouted extensively between the Ohio and Tuscarawas rivers. Courage and patriotism were his distinguishing characteristics. His family were the first to enter the territory of this county from the southeast in a wagon. He left the \"Zane trail,\" east of Lancaster, cutting a road from there to his land on the South fork, in the spring of 1800. Isaac Stadden and Colonel John Stadden were also pioneer settlers in the Licking valley this year (1800). They came from Northumberland county, Pennsylvania. John was a widower, and had been in the service of some surveying party, this, proba bly, being the means of bringing to his notice the beautiful valley of the Licking. It was, probably, the same party to which he was attached as axe man, or chain-carrier, that Captain Elias Hughes served as hunter. Isaac Stadden had a wife and two children. In the spring of 1800, these veteran pioneers came up the Licking valley, entered some bottom borhood of Marietta, they decided to remain there a year apd raise a crop, thus postponing, for a brief period, their removal further westward. Early in the spring of 1800 they removed their families to Shawnee run, locating about two miles east of the junction of the North and South forks of the Licking, on' the farm once owned by Hon. Wm. O'Bannon. Here they remained two years, when they purchased land upon Hog run, within the present limits of Licking township, and re moved to this land. (A full account of these two pioneers will be found in a history of that town ship, as their lives, and that of their families, were mostly spent there. Mr. Pitzer died there in 18 19.) The Greens had a family of fourteen children, eleven of whom were born before their arrival at Shawnee run. John Green, one of the sons, was an extensive contractor on the Ohio canal, and re moved to Ottawa, Illinois. He led an active, in dustrious life, and acquired a large fortune. Isaac, another son, was a man of much intelligence and worth, who represented Licking county several terms in the legislature \u2014 being elected in 1841 and 1842, Richard died in 1872, aged eighty -seven, having been seventy-two years a resident of this county. He was the canoe-boy of the Muskingum in 1800, and lived here a longer time than any other person, except Colonel Jonathan Hughes, the salt-sack boy of 1798. In the spring of 1800, probably not a week after the advent of Green and Pitzer at Shawriee run, John Van Buskirk arrived and entered upon a tract of land of thirty-one hundred acres, on the South fork, in what is now Union township. He had previously purchased it, and at once began erecting buildings, clearing land and raising crops. Mr. Van Buskirk was born in New Jersey, and came with his father's family in 1780 to Brooke county, Virginia, where he grew to manhood, and where, also, he married and lived until his removal to the South fork, as above stated. He was a man of liberal means, being pecuniarily in more indepen dent circumstances than most of the pioneers. He came to his new home in the wilderness by way of \"Zane's trail,\" as far as Brush creek, in Fair field county; bringing with him a full supply of wagons and domestic animals, and made the sixth settler within the present limits of the count)-."], [225, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 2I7 land, partially cleared, a mile below Newark, now on the Jones farm, built a cabin, prepared some ground and put in a crop. At the same time the Elliotts were raising corn below them, on the Davis farm, and Green and Pitzer doing the same thing on Shawnee run, on the O'Bannon farm, while near the mouth of Bow ling Green run, Hughes and Ratliff were similarly employed. That was all the farming that was be ing done on the Licking in 1800, between the junction of the North and South forks and the line of Muskingum county. The pioneers in the sparsely settled Northwest Territory were not then favored with mail facilities, and no communication passed between Mr. Stad den and his wife, during all those weary months that he was engaged in erecting a cabin, clearing land and raising corn, from early spring until late in the summer. A mail was occasionally brought to Zanesville, then the nearest post-office to the settlers on the Licking, but little reliance was placed on it. If letters came through at all from the old settlements, the pioneers were lucky, even if they were a long time on the way. They were subject to high postage \u2014 about eight times the pre sent rate. In September, 1800, Isaac Stadden removed his family- from Pennsylvania into the cabin he had erected for them. His was the second wagon that came up the Licking valley. Meanwhile John Stadden, having made the acquaintance of Betsey Green, daughter of Benjamin, became enamored of the fair maid of Shawnee run, and after an honest courtship, of reasonable length for pioneer times, they were married; this being the first mar riage within the territory now embraced in Licking county. This pioneer marriage was to take place on December 10, 1800, but was not consummated until Christmas of that year. There was not a preacher or squire nearer than Zanesville, and when the late Judge Henry Smith, who was then acting magistrate of the Northwest Territory, living at the mouth of Licking, was invited to perform the marriage ceremony in this case, on the tenth of December, he informed Mr. Stadden that the territorial laws required that written notice of the intention of the parties be posted up at three con- spicuous places for fifteen days before the wedding, and if that had been done, he would be there. Mr. Stadden's ignorance of territorial law suddenly- brought him to anchor. He came home, put up the notices as quickly as possible, and submitted with some disappointment and despondency to the inexorable law of the land \u2014 hence the marriage occurred on Christmas instead of December ioth. Squire Smith came up to Mr. Green's, and made John and Betsey one. A child born to them in the latter half of 1801, was the second birth in what is now Licking county, and its decease, before the close of that year, was the second death. Mrs. Isaac Stadden related to Hon. Isaac Smucker that late in October, 1800, her husband went into Cherry valley to hunt deer, that being better hunting ground than the Licking valley; and that he came home in the evening greatly excited, having discovered the \"Old Fort,\" of which he had not before heard. The next morning they mounted their horses, and took a good look at this great curiosity, riding all around it on the top of the embankment. So far as known, they were the first white persons who saw this great work of antiquity. During the early years of Mr. Stadden's resid- ence here, Indians were more or less numerous, but were pacifically disposed. Mrs. Stadden once gave a humorous account of the attempt of one of them, who came along frequently, to buy her of her husband, by the offer of a considerable number of skins of wild animals. The offer was made in good faith, and somewhat pressed, but Mr. Stadden was not much in a trafficking mood on that occasion. In November, or early in December, 1800, Mr. Stadden went out to hunt deer above the \"Old Fort,\" on Ramp creek. There, toward evening, in a dense forest, he met John Jones, Phineas Ford, Frederick Ford, Benoni Benjamin and a Mr. Den- ner. Jones and the Fords were married to the sisters of Benjamin. Jones was of Welsh extrac- tion, born in New Jersey, but had lived in the same neighborhood with Mr. Stadden in Pennsylvania, where they had been schoolmates. Neither knew that the other was in the Northwest Territory. Neither had seen the other for many years, and had known nothing of their intervening histories, or"], [226, "2l8 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. whereabouts. The romantic interest of such a meeting under such circumstances may be imagined. The Fords were Yankees, and Benjamin, a Penn sylvanian, and all became prominent pioneer settlers. When met at their camp-fire by Stadden, they were exploring with a view to settlement, and did settle a few months afterward \u2014 Mr. Jones on the Munson farm, and the Fords and Benjamin on Ramp creek. Denner became a day laborer for McCauly, who located near the mouth of Ramp creek early in i8ot. The company accepted Mr. Stadden's invitation to visit him at his cabin, and did so shortly after. Jones raised a crop of corn in the Licking bottoms, near Stadden's cabin in the summer of 1801. John Stadden moved to Hog run in 1802, and in 1808 was elected the first sheriff of Licking county, in which office he served two years. He was also, for some years, collector of taxes, and held variousjDOsitions of honor and trust in civil and military life. His son Richard was sheriff of the county from 1834 to 1838, and was, in the last named year, elected a member of the Ohio senate. Colonel John Stadden was a man of integrity, uprightness, and a fair degree of intelligence. Late in life he removed with his wife to Illinois, where they died. They were honored and highly esteemed while living, and died leaving a reputation untarnished. He and his wife were among the original members of the first Methodist society formed in the county, by Rev. Asa Shinn, in 1804. Mr. Isaac Stadden was a carpenter by trade, and brought his tools when he came to the county, which he used to the great convenience of the neighborhood. Especially was he useful in making all the coffins needed by the early settlers, for a number of years. The coffin for Mrs. Ratliff, who died in 1802, was made by him, and so were many others. They were at first made out of puncheons split out, then hewed and planed. Isaac Stadden built a \"hand-mill\" during the winter after he came, for the purpose of grind ing the corn grists of a few neighbors, as well as. for his own accommodation. This was the first effort at mill building, with the possible exception of one, a \"make shift,\" previously erected by Elias Hughes. He raised a crop in 1801, and in the spring of i So 2 moved upon land he had purchased further down the valley, upon which he lived until his death, which occurred in 1841. His wife contin ued to reside upon the same place until she died, July, 1870, at the ripe age of ninety years. The township of Licking, including the whole of what is now Licking county, except the Refugee lands, and a portion of Knox, was organized in 1 801; and in January, 1802, at an election held at the cabin of Elias Hughes, Isaac Stadden was elected justice of the peace-^the first in the terri tory now comprising Licking county. Probably Mr. James Maxwell was elected constable at this same election. In a year or two John Warden was elected the successor of Mr. Stadden. He resigned in a short time and William Wright, of Newark, succeeded to the office. A short time after Isaac Stadden moved upon his own land he formed a partnership with a Mr. John Goldthwaite for the purpose of starting a nursery of fruit trees. This project was a success; and from this nursery came many of the orchards in this section of the State. Johnny Appleseed had a nursery on what was known as the \"Scotland farm,\" about three miles northeast of Newark, but it did not amount to much, as it was not enclosed, and the young trees were eaten off by cattle. When she left her home in Pennsylvania, in 1800, Mrs: Stadden took up and placed in her \"chist\" three small apple trees, which she planted with her own hands here. One of these trees is yet living and bearing. Three sons of Isaac Stadden are yet living in this county. A few days after the Staddens located in\" Licking valley, Captain Samuel Elliott came, locating one and a half miles below the junction of the North and South forks, in September, 1800. In the spring of this year he and his two sons left his mountain home in Allegheny county, Maryland, and came to this valley, where they erected a cabin, planted corn and potatoes, then returned for the family. This cabin was built near the large spring, on the farm now owned by T. J. Davis. He was probably drawn to this point to be near Messrs. Green and Pitzer, who were from his neighborhood in Mary land. In autumn Captain Elliott returned with his wife and twelve children, took possession of their cabin, and harvested the crop."], [227, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 219 Elliott's family constituted the eighth then within the limits of the county, and the colony was not further increased during the year 1800. The marriage of Colonel Stadden and Betsey Green, however, created another family, so that nine fam ilies occupied the territory now embraced within the limits of Licking county at the closing of the first year of this century. While Captain Elliott lived here he entertained, several days, Rev. McDonald, a missionary of the Presbyterian church, who preached the first ser mon ever delivered in the territory of Licking county. It was late in 1801, or early in 1802. The manufacture of a web of twenty yards of nettle-cloth by the wife and daughters of Captain Elliott, while they resided here, was one of the events of the day. In the absence of flax it was the best they could do. Such were the expedients necessity compelled the pioneers to resort to. Captain Elliott was born near Ballymena, county Antrim, province of Ulster, Ireland, in 1751. On his arrival in America, in 1771, he settled in the colony of Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia. Here he lived during the dawning era of the Revolution, and, when the contest commenced, took sides with the struggling colonists. Toward the close of the war he married in Northampton county, Pennsyl vania, from where he emigrated to western Mary land, remaining there until his removal to the Licking valley. In 1802 Captain Elliott erected the first hewed log house in Newark. It stood on \u2022 East Main street, on Mrs. Fullerton's lot. He moved into it during the same year, and was one of Newark's earliest inhabitants. 'He soon purchased of General Schenck, one of the proprietors of Newark, some lands lying about a mile west of the village, upon which he settled in 1804, and where he remained until his death, which occurred May 24, 1831. The death of Mrs. Elliott took place on the same farm, May 19, 1S22. Her age was sixty-four years. She was a woman of rare excellence of character, and ruled her household wisely and well, her children becoming useful members of society. She died in communion with the Presbyterian church, and her pastor, Rev. S. S. Miles, commem orated her virtues in an appreciative obituary sketch, published in the Newark Advocate, May 23, 1822, then conducted by Mr. Benjamin Briggs. Upon the organization of Licking county, in 1808, Captain Elliott became coroner, serving many years in that office, and was succeeded by his son, Alexander, who served many years. In religion the Elliotts were Presbyterians; and in character, were upright, industrious and highly esteemed in all the relations of life. Three of the boys were engaged in the war of 1812; two of the grandsons, David Taylor and Alexander Elliott, served with honor in the Mexican war, and two, William and Jonathan Taylor, served long and faithfully in the Union army during the late war. William encountered a fatal rebel bullet at Arkan- sas Post; Jonathan survived the \"march to the sea\" with Sherman's army. Reuben Lunceford, and a number of other great grandsons, also fought the rebels, including two young Elliotts, who lost their lives in the service. Lieutenant Reuben Harris, a grandson, was long a gallant officer in the navy, and died in the service. One of the daughters married Dr. Noah Harris, who came to Newark to practice his profession about the year 1808, and had a successful profes- sional career of twenty-five years. He left a num- ber of children who were educated by their mother, who lived to the age of seventy-three, dying at Newark August 16, 1S63. The late Hon. Horatio J. Harris, was a son of Doctor Harris, and a grandson of the pioneer, Captain Elliott. He attained to high position in public life, and may be regarded as a successful politician, who was not without a good share of ability. He was a native of Newark, but removed in early life to Indiana, where he served respec- tively in the offices of clerk of the senate, State senator, and auditor of State. During General Taylor's presidential term he was appointed district attorney of Mississippi, having previously moved to that State. Ill health compelled him to resign his position; he came to Newark on a visit to his relatives, where he died, having scarcely reached middle life. He was a young man of much prom- ise. Sarah, the youngest daughter of Captain Elliott, died in Newark May 13, 1872, aged seventy-four years. She married in 182 1, the late General Jon athan Taylor. Mr. Taylor represented this county"], [228, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 220 in the general assembly, and was elected to Con gress in 1838. He led a very active life and was a commanding character in the community. At the time of his death, his oldest son, David, was a Soldier in Mexico, and died shortly after his return. Another son lost his life in the great rebellion. Mrs. Taylor had a fine intellect and excellent judg ment. She was a model pioneer woman, who practiced all the matronly virtues, led an industri ous, useful life, and died regretted by her many friends. This closes a sketch of the early pioneers of Licking county, up to the beginning of the year 1801. Of the family of Carpenter, who probably came to the Licking valley in 1800, or before, nothing whatever is known, as before stated; and it is even doubted whether he brought his family with him. Without including this, the number of families within this territory at the beginning of i8or, was eight, all settlers in Licking valley, and all, except Van Buskirk, within the present limits of Madison township. The Fords, Jones and Benjamin, the party mentioned as having been found by Stadden in Raccoon valley late in the fall of 1800, were not settlers of that year; they were here to \"prospect\" and enter land, and were settlers early in the spring of r8or, w*hen they came with their families. Biographical sketches of them, and other early pioneers will be found in the history of the township in which each settled. CHAPTER XXV. PIONEER WOMEN OF THE COUNTY.

We tread the paths their feet have worn, We sit beneath their orchard trees, We hear, like them, the hum of bees And rustle of the bladed corn; We turn the pages that they read, Their written words we linger o'er. But in the sun they cast no shade, No voice is heard, no sign is made, No step is on the conscious floor.\" \u2014 Whittier. THE history of any territory would be incom- plete without some notice of the pioneer women, who, by reason of sex and their limited sphere of action, could not become conspicuous in the great drama of pioneer life, but whose busy hands and feet, and conscientious regard of duty made them great factors in the establishment of the solid foundation upon which the society of to-day rests. The people of to-day hardly realize or appreciate what they owe to the large-hearted pioneer mothers, who braved with their husbands and children the perils of the wilderness; who reared their families in the fear of God, and im planted within them all the virtues necessary to the welfare of humanity, and passed away, leaving to them an inheritance that is invaluable and that should ever be cherished and kept in sacred re membrance. It is a little thing to preserve their names in the pages of history; yet it is about all that is left to do. These sketches must necessarily be brief;"], [229, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 221 their lives were much alike; they met the stern necessities of the hour, and were content in the consciousness of duty nobly done. Mrs. Sarah Taylor, widow of the late General Jonathan Taylor, was one of these. She was a daughter of Captain Samuel Elliott, the youngest of twelve children, and came from Maryland with her father, who settled in the Licking valley in 1800, when but half dozen families were to be found within the present limits of Licking county. Her husband was a member of the State legisla ture, and of the Congress of the United States. She was born May 2, 1798, and died May 13, 1872, having been a resident of this county seven ty-two years. She had a fine intellect, sound judg ment, good sense, and had, by observation, inter course with the world and much reading, acquired a large fund of information. She cherished the Christian faith, and had been for more than forty years prior to her death in communion with the Presbyterian church. Mrs. Catharine Stadden was born in Northum berland county, Pennsylvania, in June, 1780. Her father, Mr. Kleiber was a German by birth. She and her husband, Isaac Stadden, were also pio neers of the Licking valley in 1800, arriving shortly before Mr. Samuel Elliott, and locating about a mile below where Newark was laid out two years after their arrival. Mrs. Stadden lived here seventy years, nearly all the years of her adult life, and they were eventful years \u2014 eventful in her own life, eventful in the history of the west, and the history of the world. She died July 3, 1870, in the ninety-first year of her age. She was one of the best of the pioneer mothers; a woman of rare frankness and candor; of integrity of character and fidelity to her convictions, and one whose aim it was to discharge her duty in all the varied rela tions of life. She cherished the Christian religion during the last sixty years of her life, adopting views known as Socinian, during the latter half of her life, and to which she adhered until her death. Her memory was always well stored with history and incidents of pioneer life, much of which has found its way into other parts of this work. Mrs. Sarah Davis belonged to the first pioneer family of this county \u2014 that of Captain Elias Hughes. She was born in 1790, and came with her father to the Licking valley in 1798, being one of twelve children whom that noted pioneer brought to the Bowling Green, four miles below Newark. In 1808 she married Samuel Davis, who died in 1837. Mrs. Davis survived her hus band thirty-two years, dying in 1869, in the eigh tieth year of her age. Mrs. Doctor Harris was a pioneer of 1800, be ing also a daughter of Captain Samuel Elliott, above mentioned. Mrs. Harris was eight years older than her sister, Mrs. Taylor, and retained a vivid impression of their settlement in the wilder ness, being eight years of age at the time. She remained in this vicinity during her long life of seventy-three years, and was the mother of a large family of children. She possessed in an eminent degree those social and domestic virtues which so adorned the pioneer mothers. She died, August 16, 1863. One of the pioneer women of 1803, was Mrs. Mary Kemper, a daughter of Major Anthony Pitzer, who came with her father to Hog run, in Licking township, when she was five years of age. After her marriage she removed to Perry county, near Thornville, and in 1863, to Hamilton county, Indiana, where she died, April 22, 1876, aged seventy-eight years. Among the pioneer women of 1804 in this county were Mrs. Henry Smith, Mrs. Jemima Thrap, Mrs. Bennett, Mrs. Nancy Sutton, Mrs. Perkins, Mrs. Sarah Jeffries, and Mrs. Naomi Ted rick. Mrs. Henry Smith was a prominent and impor tant actor in the pioneer settlement of this county, and spent all of her early life on the frontier. She was born in 1770, near Hagerstown, Maryland, and settled, at an early period of her life, in the Kanawha country, while the Indians were still making marauding excursions into western Vir ginia, and on one occasion assisted in defending a block-house against the attacks of the savages. Some time before the close of the last century, she married the late Judge Henry Smith and removed with him to the mouth of the Licking, where, in 1800, he was an acting territorial magistrate. It was he who came up to Shawnee run, twenty-five miles distant, on Christmas day, 1800, to perform the marriage ceremony for Mr. John Stadden and"], [230, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 222 Betsy Green, the first couple married in this county. In 1804, she, with her husband and fam ily, settled permanently in Madison township, where she died, October 25, 1866, at the age of ninety-seven. Mrs. Jemima Thrap was a neighbor of Mrs. Smith in the Licking valley, and came there in the same year. She was born on Ten Mile creek, Washington county, Pennsylvania, near the town of Amity, in January, 1782. When she was three years of age, her parents settled on land near Morgantown, where she grew from childhood to maturity amid all the well known scenes and cir cumstances of pioneer life. She became a member of the Methodist church in 1802, and in 1803, was united in marriage to Joseph Thrap. In 1805 or 1806 the second Methodist church in this county was organized at the cabin of Joseph Thrap in the Licking valley, and Mrs. Thrap's name was the second one on the list of this class, that of her husband being first ; making her the first of her sex to unite with the second organized church in this county. The Thrap cabin was a preaching place many years, and \" Mother Thrap,\" as she was generally called, was noted for her kindness of heart and benevolence; entertaining for years all the itinerant Methodist ministers that came into the valley. She maintained to the end of her life an unblemished moral and religious character, be ing noted for zeal in the cause of Christianity. She died suddenly July 25, 1867, in the eighty fifth year of her age. Mrs. Bennett was one of the oldest children of that noted pioneer hunter, Mr. John Channel, and was also a settler in the Licking valley. She died in Muskingum county at the age of, probably, nearly four score years. Mrs. Nancy Sutton was born in Fayette county, Pennsylvania, in 1777, entering into the marriage relation with Jehu Sutton about the beginning of the present century. They settled in Licking township, where they passed the remainder of their lives. Both were consistent members of the Hog Run Baptist church. Mrs. Sutton died June 7, 1874, in her ninety-eighth year. Mrs. Perkins was a daughter of Mr. Robert Church, a pioneer of Licking valley, and was born in Fairfax county, Virginia, in the year 1791. She died in Newark, May 9, 1880, aged eighty-nine years. Mrs. Sarah Jeffries was born in Virginia in 1795, and accompanied her father, Mr. Deweese, to the vicinity of Newark in 1804, where she lived the remainder of her life, dying at the ripe age of eighty-two years. Mrs. Naomi Tedrick, the last of those above mentioned as pioneers of 1804, was the daughter of one of the Suttons who settled in Licking town ship, and who came from Fayette county, Pennsyl vania. She married Captain John Tedrick, a well known pioneer settler, and was an intelligent woman, a member of the Baptist church, and much esteemed. She died May 13, 1877, at tne advanced age of ninety-one. A few of the pioneer women of 1805, in this county, were Mrs. Almena Rose Bancroft, Mrs. Motherspaw, Mrs. Everett, Mrs. Duke, Mrs. Dorsey, Mrs. Walcott, Mrs. Seymour, Mrs. Mun son and Mrs. Myers. The first was one of the original Granville colony, settling in that place in 1805. She died November 4, 1874, aged seventy-three years. Mrs. Motherspaw was the wife of the late Daniel Motherspaw, and a daughter of John Feasel, who settled in Clay Lick valley in 1805. She was born in 1787, in Shenandoah valley, Virginia, and died at her residence in Franklin township, April 10, 1875. Seventy years of her life were passed in this county. 1 She was a devoted member of the Lutheran church, and a moderpioneer woman. Mrs. Sabra Everett, daughter of Hiram and Sabra Rose, and wife of Revel Everett, of Hart ford township, was born in Granville, Massachusetts, June 22, 1797, and came with her parents to Gran ville in this county, in the fall of 1805. August 21, 1 81 7, she was married; lived a Christian life of seventy-two years, dying October 30, 1869. Mrs. Sarah Duke, wife of David Duke, and daughter of the late Nathan Conard, died at her residence in Liberty township September 20, 1,877, in the seventy-second year of her age. She was born in Fairfield county (now Knox county), December 24, 1805, but lived from her infancy in this county. She was a member of the Methodist church from childhood; married Mr. Duke March 1, 1827, and raised a family of seven sons and one daughter."], [231, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 223 Mrs. Susan E. Dorsey, a daughter of Rufus Enyart, was a much esteemed pioneer woman. She came with her father from Miami valley to what is now Hanover township, in 1805, when she was two years old, remaining there until her death, July 12, 1878. September 21, 1826, she married Henry H. Tiebout, who died in 1847, and, in 1849, she married Mr. Owen Dorsey, who died in 1876. She was a member of the Protestant Meth odist church forty years. Mrs. Rebecca Walcott belonged to the original Granville colony, few of whom are probably liv ing at the present time. She was a daughter of Deacon Silas Winchell, and was born in Granville, Massachusetts, February 9, 1805, and was nine months old when the colony reached Granville town ship. This was an intelligent colony of pioneers, and although means of education were scarce in the wilderness, they looked well to the education of their children. Rebecca Winchell was not only carefully trained in all domestic work, but fairly educated, and was employed in teaching prior to her marriage. She married Horace Walcott April 13, 1829, by whom she had four sons and four daughters. Three of her sons were actively en gaged in the late war. She died in May, 1879. Mrs. Elizabeth Seymour, wife of Adam Seymour, and daughter of John Channel, was born in Vir ginia, December 8, 1789, and came with her father to Madison township, where she was married April 14, 1808. She was the mother of nine children; was a member of the Methodist Episcopal church, and greatly beloved by all who knew her. She died at the age of seventy-eight years. Mrs. Munson was the wife of General Augustine Munson, a prominent man in the Granville col ony and in the county. They were married in 1807, and lived upon the farm, where she died, more than sixty years. She was seventy-six at the date of her death, and was an excellent and intel ligent New England woman. Mrs. Mary Myers was born in New Jersey, Jan uary 29, 1780. She accompanied her parents to Brooke county, Virginia, where she married John Myers in 1798. In 1805, with her husband and four children, she settled in Union township, this county, on land Mr. Myers purchased of John Van Buskirk. Their neighbors were Cornelius Elliott and Richard Wells, who had preceded them two years. She raised a large family and died July 12, 1870, in her ninetieth year. Hers was a life of much toil and hardship, though pro longed to an unusual length. The year 1806 brought with it many additional pioneers to this county, among whom were Mrs. Margaret Wilson, Mrs. Horn, and Mrs. Lovina Hughes. The first was a native of Frederick county, Vir ginia, and was born in 1792. She was a resident of Newark forty-five years, and died March 8, 1869. She was long a devoted member of the Presbyte rian church. Mrs. Hannah Horn was born in Loudoun coun ty, Virginia, May 25, 1785, and married Henry Horn in 1804. They settled in Union township, where Mrs. Horn died at the venerable age of ninety-one years. Mrs. Lovina Hughes was one of the earliest resi dents and oldest pioneers of the county. She was the wife of the venerable Colonel Jonathan Hughes (a son of the first settler, Elias Hughes, and who is yet living in Washington township), whom she married in June, 181 7. She was born in Hardy county, Virginia, June 14, 1800, and came with her father, Joseph Davis, to Newark. In 1810 Mr. Davis settled in Washington township, on~the farm where Mrs. Hughes died, in her seventy seventh year, having resided more than seventy years in the county. For the last forty years of her life she was a member of the Episcopal church of Utica. A husband, five children, twenty grand children, and four great-grandchildren survive her. It was one of the greatest pleasures of her declin ing years, as it was of all the pioneer mothers, to call her children and grandchildren about her and tell them the thrilling stories of pioneer life \u2014 a picture so beautifully portrayed by Whittier \u2014 \"Shut in from all the world without, We sat the clean-winged hearth about, Content to let the north wind roar, In baffled rage at pane and door, While the red logs before us beat The frost-line back with tropic heat; And ever, when a louder blast Shook beam and rafter as it passed, The merrier up its roaring draught The great throat of the chimney laughed, The house-dog on his paws outspread,"], [232, "224 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY.

Mrs. Mina Adelia Howe was born in Granville, Massachusetts, January 18, 1 799, and came with her father's family to Granville, in this county, in 1807, where she lived seventy years, dying February 27, 1877, m her seventy-eighth year. She was the daughter of Arunah and Mindwell Clark, and mar ried Daniel Howe at the age of twenty. Mrs. Hoskinson became a resident of Franklin town ship in 1807, and there passed her long life of eighty-seven years, dying June 24, 1880. Mrs. Eleanor Donivan was a pioneer of 1808. She was born in 1792, in Virginia, and died near Chatham, in this county, at the age of eighty-one. Mrs. Mary Cully was also a pioneer of 1808, being a daughter of the veteran pioneer, Thomas Taylor. She died May 2, 1875, in her sixty seventh year. Another pioneer of 1808, was Mrs. Hannah Harris, a daughter of Mr. Jacob Pugh, a revolu tionary soldier. She was born in Hardy county, Virginia, May 10, 1776. She and her husband first settled' on the Clear fork, but in 18 10, re moved to Burlington township, where Mr. Harris purchased and cleared up a farm. Her husband died in 1844; she surviving him thirty-two years, dying December 7, 1872, in her ninety-seventh year. Mrs. Elizabeth Shaffer was among the pioneers of 18 10; was a daughter of Phillip Peters, and was born in Hampshire county, Virginia, September 22, 1790. She married in 1810, and removed to a farm two miles northeast of Newark, where she died in her eighty-sixth year. Three notable pioneer women of 181 2 were Mrs. Elizabeth Moore, Mrs. Sarah Harris and Mrs. Rachel Young. These all died within the same decade, and all were more than eighty years of age at the time of death ; the first being eighty-three, the second eighty-six, and the third eighty-seven. Mrs. Moore, a native of Adams county, Pennsylvania, was born September 19, 1787; Mrs. Harris came from Ontario county, New York, and Mrs. Young from Virginia. Mrs. Jacob Sperry, Mrs. Sarah Robertson and Mrs. Benjamin F. Coleman were pioneers of 18 13. Mrs. Sperry belonged to the extensive family of Wilsons, who were prominent pioneers of the county. She was accidently killed at the age of eighty-two, near her home in the vicinity of Utica. Mrs. Robertson was born near Chambersburgh, Franklin county, Pennsylvania, June 24, 1791; was married to Major William Robertson, January 28, 1813. They removed to Washington township, and settled near the present site of Utica, where Mrs. Robertson died in her eight-seventh year. Mrs. Coleman was a native of Rhode Island, and was born in Newport, September 9, 1790. She was a resident of Newark sixty-six years; a member of the Episcopal church, and was nearly eighty-nine at the time of her death. Mrs. Elizabeth Smoots, Mrs. Sarah M. Henry and Mrs. Sarah Taylor were among the pioneers of 1815. Mrs. Smoots resided in Washington township sixty-three years, and died August 7, 1879, aged eighty-seven. She was from Shenandoah county, Virginia. Mrs. Henry was from Frederick county, Mary land; came with her parents to Circleville, Ohio, in 181 1 ; married John W. Henry in 181 2; remov ed to Granville township in 181 5; to the vicinity of Newark in 1833, where she died in 1877, aged eighty-four. Mrs. Sarah Taylor was born in Kentucky, .and after the death of her husband, the late judge William Taylor, lived some years with her brother, Stephen McDougal, in Newark, where she died November 8, 1868, in her seventieth year. She was for many years a consistent member of the Prerbyterian church of Newark. Mrs. Margaret Winegarner was born in Loudoun county, Virginia, February 4, 1775, and was re-"], [233, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 225 markable for her length of life, being ninety-eight at the time of her death, November 3, 1873. She belonged to a long-lived family, one of her ancestors living more than one hundred years. She was a resident of Hopewell township, and one of the first members of Gratiot Baptist church, organized in 1821. She settled in this county- in 1816, as did also Mrs. Mary Swigart, who was born in that place, well known in history, as Gettysburgh, Penn sylvania. Mrs. Swigart was long a resident of Newark, but died in Seneca county, Ohio, at the age of eighty-five. Among the later pioneers of Licking may be mentioned the following: Mrs. Sarah Miller, 1817; Mrs. Elizabeth English, 181 7; Mrs. Matilda Coul ter, 1817; Mrs. Catharine Wilkin, 1819; Mrs. Abigail Rowe, 1820; Mrs. Sarah Conine, 1821; Mrs. Margaret Weaver, 1823; Mrs. Susan Fry, 1827; Mrs. Colville, 1829; Mrs. Eli Ashbrook and Mrs. Brakebill, in 1830. Mrs. Miller wa's born in Hardy county, Virginia, January 17, 1795, and died in this county January 16, 1877. Mrs. Elizabeth Cook English was born in Greens burgh, Westmoreland county, Pennsylvania, De cember 13, 1800, and died in Newark, in Septem ber, 1878. Mrs. Coulter was the daughter of Caleb Pum phrey, and was born in Ohio county, Virginia, No vember 9, 1797. Upon their removal to this west ern wilderness, her mother rode the entire distance on horseback, and the children walked most of the way, and assisted in driving the cows, though the journey was made in March, and while the snow yet covered the ground. Her father was an earn est, energetic Methodist preacher, and much de voted to the interests of his religion, his family and his neighbors. She married John Coulter in 18 17, and settled near Chatham; in 1S21 she removed to the Clay Lick valley, where she died December 12, 1872, aged seventy-five years. Mrs. Wilkin was born in Shenandoah county, Virginia, March 15, 1802; was married to Jacob Wilkin in 1822, and died November 28, 1875. Mrs. Rowe was a native of Maryland, and died at her residence in East Newark, December 6, 1875, aged almost seventy-nine years. Mrs. Conine came from New Jersey; married Richard Conine in 1805, and died near Pataskala, October 7, 1875, at the great age of ninety-two years. Mrs. Weaver, wife of John Weaver, was born in Hampshire county, Virginia, December 29, 1790; was married in 181 1, and settled near Homer in in 1823, where she died July 10, 1873. Mrs. Fry was born in Loudoun county, Virginia, September 18, 1790; married Daniel Fry in 182 1, and died April 1, 1879, aged eighty-two. Mrs. Colville died April 3, 1870, in her seventy ninth year. Mrs. Ashbrook was the wife of Rev. Eli Ash brook, and died in Monroe township, aged more than eighty years. Mrs. Brakebill was a resident of Newark more than sixty years, and died \u2022 at the great age of ninety. Mrs. Priest was remarkable for her great age, be ing, when she died, over one hundred years. She was born in Culpepper county, Virginia, in 1766, where she continued to reside until near the close of the last century, when she came with her hus band and six children to the Muskingum and settled near the mouth of Licking. Subsequently her hus band died and she removed to this county, settling on Rocky fork, and afterwards moved to Madison township, where she passed the remainder of her days. As evidence of her vigor and strength, it may be stated that she walked every mile of the distance from 'Culpepper to the Muskingum, the distance being about four hundred miles, and car ried an infant child. Her mind was a storehouse of Revolutionary and pioneer incidents. During the last sixty years of her life she was a member of the Baptist church. Mrs. Stanbery, wife of Hon. William Stanbery, was a lady of much intelligence and force of char acter, and a resident of this county from 1809 to her death, which took place at \"Oakland,\" Madi son township, March 17, 1873, when she was eighty-seven. Mrs. Maholm, long a resident of this county, died in her eightieth year. Mrs. Elizabeth Pyle was from Rockingham county, Virginia, and died May 26, 1874, at Van attaburgh, in the ninetieth year of her age. Mrs. Rachel Abbott was born in Frederick"], [234, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 226 county, Virginia, August 10, 1782, was married in 1806, came to Ohio in 1812, and died in this coun ty, February 16, 1874, at the advanced age of more than ninety-one years. Mrs. Hugh McMullen was a daughter of the late David Gillespie, and died in Chicago, Illinois, February 17, 1876, aged sixty-three years. Mrs. Henthorn, of McKean township, died in June, 1875, at the great age of ninety-six years. Mrs. Sarah Kindle was more remarkable for age than any other pioneer woman of the county, be ing one hundred and five years old at the date of her death, which occurred in Union county, De cember 28, 1870. She was from Virginia, and lived many years on the Flint ridge. Mrs. Spellman was an early settler of Granville township, and died June 6, 1880, at the age of eighty-one. Mrs. Hannah Sargent Rowell was born in Penn sylvania in 1783, and died in this county, August 12, 1880, at the great age 01 ninety-seven years. It is proper before closing this chapter to men- tion Mrs. Hannah Reeves, a noted pioneer preacher, who though not a resident of this county, frequent ly visited it in the prosecution of her work. Mrs. Reeves was a daughter of James and Mary Pearce, and was born in Devonshire, England, January 30, 1800. She united with the Methodist church De cember 18, 1818, under the preaching of Rev. James Thorn, and immediately began preaching, following itinerant ministry in England until 1831, when she came to America. July 6, 1831, she married Rev. William Reeves at Zanesville, Ohio, but continued her preaching, becoming well known and much respected through this portion of the State. She was a woman of much ability, force and eloquence ; very zealous in her labors, making many converts, and attracting large audiences wherever she went. She died at New Brighton, Pennsylvania, November 13, 1869. \" Rest from all bitter thoughts and things!

PIONEER days for Licking county and the State of Ohio are gone forever; the wolf, bear, deer, Indian and all associations and reminiscences of those \"good old days\" have long since faded from sight if not from memory, and the pioneers, most of them, are gone too \u2014 \"How few, all weak and withered of their force, Wait on the verge of dark eternity.\" It remains to write their history, and the history of the times in which they lived, as of another, race of beings; and, if possible, to impress the best of it uppn the character of the present and future generations; for it is a history worthy of imitation"], [235, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 227 and preservation. A study of the characteristics of the pioneer fathers and mothers is calculated to ennoble the mind and strengthen the hand for the battle of life. It would require a volume to tell of their habits and customs; of their trapping and hunting; of their solitary lives in the great woods, surrounded by wild animals and wilder men; of their dress, manners, and peculiar ways; of their cabins and furniture ; of the long winter evenings by the log heap fire upon which \u2014 ' ' We piled, with care, our nightly stack Of wood against the chimney-back \u2014 The oaken log, green, huge, and thick, And on its top the stout back-stick; The knotty fore-stick laid apart, And filled between with curious art The ragged brush ; then hovering near, We watched the first red blaze appear, Heard the sharp crackle, caught the gleam On whitewashed wall and sagging beam, Until the old rude-furnished room Burst flower-like into rosy bloom.\" It was a free, happy, independent life ; full of hard ships, indeed, but sweetened with innocence and peace; with alternations of labor, pleasure and rest. The pioneers of Licking were largely from New England, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Maryland, who sought to better their condition by making permanent homes in the wilderness west of the Ohio river. They came largely on foot over the Alleghany mountains, many of them having a single horse and wagon, or a two-horse wagon, in which their worldly possessions were carried, and in which the very old or very young, only, were allowed to ride. When once settled and his cabin erected, it was not only a home and shelter tor himself and family, but for every stranger who passed that way, \"without money and without price.\" The latch string was always out, for these pioneers were great hearted people, and no man, be he white, black or red, was turned away empty. Their cabins, often not more than fifteen or twenty feet square, made of rough beech logs, with the bark still adhering to them, were frequently occu pied by a dozen or even a score of people for a night, and no complaints made for want of room; genuine hospitality always finds room enough and never apologizes for lack of more ; and when break- fast time came there was no apology for the scar city of knives, forks and spoons, for \"fingers were made before any of these.\" The fare was homely, but generally abundant. What to eat drink and wear were questions not, perhaps, difficult of solu tion in those days. The first was the easiest to solve. The deer, the bear, the wild turkey, the rabbit, the squirrel, all started up and said, or seemed to say \"eat, me.\" These had been pre pared for the red men of the forest, and were equally abundant for the pioneer. The forest was full of game, the streams full of fish, and wild fruits were abundant. To get bread required both patience and labor ; the staff of life was one of the articles that must be earned \"by the sweat of the brow;\" it could not be gathered from the bushes, fished from the streams, or brought down with the rifle. Every backwoodsman once a year added to his clearing, at least, a \"truck patch.\" This was the hope and stay of the family; the receptacle of corn, beans, melons, potatoes, squashes, pumpkins, turnips, etc., each variety more perfectly developed and delicious because it grew in virgin soil. The corn and beans planted in May brought roasting ears and succotash in August. Potatoes came with the corn, and the cellar, built in the side of a convenient cliff or hill, and filled with the contents of the truck patch, secured the family against want. When the corn grew too hard for roasting ears, and was yet too soft to grind in the mill, it was reduced to meal by a grater, and whether stirred into mush or baked into johnny-cake, it made, for people with keen appetites and good stomachs, excellent food. Place before one of those brawny backwoodsmen a square foot of johnny-cake and a venison steak broiled on hickory coals, and no art of civilization could produce a more satisfactory meal. Next to the grater comes the hominy block, an article in common use among the pioneers. It consisted simply of a block of wood \u2014 a section of a tree, perhaps \u2014 with a hole burned, or dug, into it a foot deep, in which corn was pulverized with a pestle. Sometimes this block was inside the cabin, where it served as a seat for the bashful young buckskinned backwoodsman while \"sparking\" his girl; sometimes a convenient stump in front of the cabin door was prepared for, and made one of the best of hominy blocks. When pigs began to be"], [236, "228 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. raised, the natural relation between pork and beaten corn suggested the grand old idea of \"hog and hominy.\" Hominy blocks did not last long, for mills came quite early and superseded them, yet these mills were often so far apart that in stormy weather, or for want of transportation, the pioneer was com pelled to resort to his hominy block, or go without bread. In winter, the mills were frozen up nearly all the time, and when a thaw came and the ice broke, if the mill was not swept away entirely by the floods, it was so thronged with pioneers, each with his sack of corn, that some of them were often compelled to camp out near the mill and wait several days for their turn. When the grist was ground, if they were so fortunate as to possess an ox, a horse, or mule, for the purpose of trans portation, they were happy. It was not unusual to go from ten to twenty miles to mill, through the pathless, unbroken forest, and to be benighted on the journey, and chased, or treed by wolves. A majority of the pioneers, however, settled in the vicinity of a stream, upon which mills were rapidly erected. These mills were very primitive affairs \u2014 mere \"corn crackers\" \u2014 but they were an improve ment on the hominy block. They merely ground the corn, the pioneer must do his own bolting. A wire sieve was then one of the most important articles of household furniture. It always hung in its place, on a wooden peg, just under the ladder that reached to the loft. The meal was sifted and the finest used for bread. How delicious was that \"Indian pone,\" baked in a large deep skillet, which was placed upon coals raked from the fire-place to the hearth. Fresh coals were continually placed under it and upon the iron lid until the loaf, five or six inches thick, was done through. This was a different thing from johnny-cake ; it was better, and could not always be had, for to make it good, a little wheat flour was needed, and wheat flour was a precious thing in those very early days. A road cut through the forest to the mill, and a wagon for hauling the grist, were great advantages, the latter especially was often a seven day's wonder to the children of a neighborhood, and the happy owner of one often did, for years, the milling for a whole neighborhood. About once a month this good neighbor, who was in exceptionally good cir- cumstances, because able to own a wagon, would go about through the neighborhood, gather up the grists and take them to mill, often spending several days in the operation, and never think of charging for his time and trouble. The cultivation of domestic animals, both beasts and fowls, for the purposes of food, began early. Cows for milk, butter, beef, and leather, and swine for pork, were bred, ear marked and turned into the woods to browse. \"Root hog or die,\" was the law for man and beast, but the woods were prolific and the hogs grew fat. The young pigs were ex ceptionally a sweet morsel for the bear. Bruin always singled out these young animals in prefer ence to any other meat; but the pigs were often successfully defended by the older hogs, who, upon the least signs of distress from one of their num ber, would go boldly to the rescue, and fiercely at tack the foe, however formidable ; often the pig was released and bruin, or the panther, compelled to ascend a tree for safety. The boys often found wild turkeys nests in the woods, and would bring home the eggs, and place them, to be hatched, under a trusty old hen, in an outside chimney corner, where they could assist the. hen in defending the eggs and brood from the opossum or hawk. A flock of turkeys sometimes originated in this way, but more often, as they grew to maturity, they would fly away into the woods and never reappear. This grandest of birds is identical in civilized and savage life, and is the peculiar production of America. The wild ones were always a dark brown, like the leaves of their native woods, but when tamed, or \"civilized,\" the diversity of color becomes endless. When corn-bread and milk were eaten for break fast, hog and hominy for dinner and mush and milk for supper, there was little room for tea and coffee; and at a time when one bushel of wheat for a pound of coffee and four bushels for a pound of tea, were considered a fair exchange, but little of these very expensive articles was used. Next to water, the drink of the pioneers was whiskey \u2014 corn or rye whiskey. Everybody drank it. It was supposed to be indispensable to health, and a protection against the morning fogs. It was supposed to be indispensable to strength and endurance during the labors of the day, and to"], [237, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 229 sleep at night. It was supposed to be absolutely indispensable to warmth and animation in cold, chilly winter weather. It was the sacrament of friendship and hospitality; it was in universal use; yet there was probably less drunkenness in those days than at present. The whiskey was absolutely pure; it was not drugged, doctored and poisoned as it is to-day, and, although enough of it would bring drunkenness, it did not bring delirium-trem ens, or leave the system prostrated, and the victim with a head-ache upon \"sobering up.\" It was the first thing in demand as an article of commerce. Stills for its manufacture sprang up everywhere, all along the streams. Pioneers soon found a market at these stills for their corn, hence corn became the great crop, and whiskey the great article of commerce. It was the only thing that would bring money, and money they must have to pay taxes. Whiskey could be purchased for twelve or fifteen cents per gallon and paid for in corn, and the bar rel of whiskey in the cellar, was as common as the barrel of cider was later. The whiskey that was not consumed at home was shipped on flat-boats or pirogues * on the Muskingum, Ohio and Mis sissippi rivers to New Orleans and sold for Spanish gold. The rebellion against the government of the United States, commonly called the whiskey insurrection, had its growth out of the hardships of the Scotch-Irish of western Pennsylvania, who in the mother country had learned to love whiskey and hate gaugers ; and this population gave tone and character to the sirSt settlers of eastern Ohio. There was this apology for the production of whiskey, that it was the only means of disposing of surplus crops, or bringing money into the country. The hardy piooneers, after disposing of their cargo of whiskey in New Orleans, would set out for home \u2014 a distance of say fifteen hundred miles. Think of it, ye who ride in palace coaches at the rate of forty miles an hour while reclining in cush ioned seats, smoking your cigar, and reading in your morning paper the happenings of yesterday in Europe and America. While apologizing some what for those whiskey days, it may be well to say the whiskey was not probably of any special bene fit, was not to be compared to the pure water of * A canoe dug out of a log, or two canoes lashed together. 5 their springs, and that too many of the pioneers drank too much of it, and that too often it made their eyes and noses red, their children ragged and their wives wretched, as it does to-day. In clothing the pioneers conformed to the cir cumstances in which they were placed. The al most universal costume for the men was the linsey woolsey hunting shirt, or wamus, blue, butternut, or red, according to the fancy of the wearer; buck skin pants and moccasins, and sometimes, in win ter, a waist-coat of the skin of a panther, wild cat or spotted fawn. In summer, when it could be had, linen was made up into wearing apparel. The flax was grown in the summer, scutched in the fall, and during the long winter evenings was heard the buzz of the little flax wheel, which had a place in every cabin. Even those who are not pioneers can remember this flax wheel, for it was in use as late as 1850, or later. It stood in a corner, gen erally ready for use by having a large bundle of flax, wrapped around its forked stick, a thread reaching to the spindle, and a little gourd filled with water hanging conveniently at the bottom of the flax-stick, and whenever the good pioneer mother had a little spare time from cooking for a dozen work-hands, caring for a dozen children, milking a dozen cows, and taking care of the milk and but ter, besides doing all the housework and keeping everything clean and neat as a pin, she would sit down to this wheel and with foot on the treadle and nimble fingers, pile thread upon thread on the spindle, to be reeled off on a wooden reel that counted ever)- yard with a snap, and then it was ready for the great loom that occupied the loft. This loom was a wonder \u2014 it would be a wonder to-day, with its great beams, larger than any beams they put in the houses of to-day \u2014 its treadles, its shuttles, etc. Day after day could be heard the pounding of that loom, the treadles went up and down, the shuttles flew swiftly from one hand to the other through the labyrinth of warp, and yard after yard of cloth rolled upon the great roller. And then this cloth was to be cut into little and big clothes and made up with the needle; and, remem ber, this and a great deal more than any one can think of was to be gone through with every year. Wool went through about the same operation, only it was spun on the large wheel, colored with but-"], [238, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 230 ternut bark and other things, but woven on the loom and made up for winter clothing. Judge William Johnson, in an address at a pioneer meeting, says regarding this matter of clothing: \" But innovations were soon made. My father had brought out a huge trunk full of coarse broadcloth, and this tempted the young men so have coats to be married in. They would bar gain with my father for the cloth and trimmings, and with my mother for making the coat, and pay both bills by grubbing, making rails or clearing land. It may seem odd at this day that a woman of small stature, besides doing her own house work, should make two hundred rails a day with her needle and shears, and find time for reading and mental culture every day. I never think of my mother's tailoring skill, without being re minded of one instance. A young' man had purchased the cloth for his wedding coat, and, as a measure of economy, em ployed one Nancy Clark to make it up. Nancy was an expert on hunting-shirts, buckskin breeches and 'sich', but had never cut a coat, so my mother cut out the coat. Nancy made it up, but on the eve of the wedding, when tried on, instead of allow ing his arms to hang gracefully by his side as became a bride groom, it turned him into a spread eagle with arms extended upward. The wedding day was at hand, and in his perplexity he brought the coat to my mother to diagnose its disorder, and if possible, administer the proper remedies. She found there was nothing more serious than that Nancy had sewed the right sleeve in the left side, and the left sleeve in the right, and put them upside down. As luxury and extravagance in dress in creased, an old tailor with shears, goose and sleeve-board began to 'whip the cat' around the neighborhood, and my mother's occupation, except in her own family, was gone. The custom of whipping the cat, both for tailors and shoemakers, was in vogue many years after, and, like the schoolmaster boarding around, had this advantage, that if they received poor pay for their work, they were ied and lodged while they were about it. ' ' But the material for winter clothing was hard to get. As the woolen goods wore out, my father bought six sheep to com mence with, and within the first week the wolves chased the old dog under the cabin floor, and killed two of them within a few yards of the cabin door. On account of the scarcity of wool, many a night I sat up until midnight, with a pair of hand-cards mixing wool with rabbit' s fur, and carding them together, while my mother spun and knit them into mittens and stockings for her children to wear to school.\" \"Kicking frolics\" were in vogue in those early times. This was after wool was more plenty, and it was carded, spun, and wove into cloth. Half a dozen young men and an equal number of young women (for the \"fun of the thing\" it was always necessary to preserve a balance of this kind) were invited to the kicking frolic. The cabin floor was cleared for action and half a dozen chairs, or stools, placed in a circle in the center and connected by a cord to prevent recoil. On these the six young men seated themselves with boots and stockings off, and pants rolled up above the knee. Just think of making love in that shape. The cloth was placed in the centre, wet with soap-suds and then the kicking commenced by measured steps driving the bundle of cloth round and round, the elderly lady with gourd in hand pouring on more soap-suds, and every now and then, with spectacles on nose and yard-stick in hand, measuring the goods until they were shrunk to the desired width, and then calling the lads to a dead halt. Then while the lads put on hose and boots the lasses, with sleeves rolled up above the elbow, rung out the cloth and put it out on the garden fence to dry. When this was done the cabin floor was again cleared and the supper spread, after which, with their numbers increased somewhat, perhaps, they danced the happy hours of the night away until midnight, to the music of a violin and the commands of some amateur cotillon caller, and were ready to attend another such frolic the follow ing night. The costume of the women deserves a passing lotice. The pioneers proper, of course, brought with them something to wear like that in use where they came from; but this could not last always, and new apparel, such as the new country afforded, had to be provided. Besides, the little girls sprang up into womanhood with the rapidity of the native butterweed, and they must be made both decent and attractive, and what is more, they were willing to aid in making themselves so. The flax patch, therefore, became a thing of as prime necessity as the truck patch. On the side next to the woods the flax grew tall, slender and delicate, and was carefully pulled by the girls and kept by itself to make finery of. The stronger growth did well enough for clothing for the men, and warp for the linsey-woolsey, and even every-day dresses for the women, but for Sundays, when everybody went to \"meeting,\" the girls, especially, wanted some thing nice, just as they do to-day. This fine flax, therefore, was carefully pulled, carefully rotted, carefully broken, carefully scutched, carefully hackled, carefully spun, carefully dyed in divers colors, and carefully woven in cross-barred figures, tastefully diversified, straining a point to get Turkey-red enough to put a single thread between the duller colors to mark their outline like the circle around a dove's eye. Of such goods the"], [239, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 23I rustic beauty made her Sunday gown, and then with her Vandyke of snow-white homespun linen, her snow-white home-knit stocking, and possibly white kid slippers, she was a sight for sore eyes and often for sore hearts. No paint or arsenic was needed, for active exercise in the open air under a sunbonnet, or a broad-brimmed hat, made by her mother out of rye straw, gave her cheek an honest, healthful glow, and to her eyes the brightness and beauty of a fawn's. Possibly those white kid slip pers have caused a nod of skepticism. This is the way it was done. Her brother, or lover, shot six fine squirrels; she tanned the skins herself in a sugar-trough, and had them made up at consider able expense and trouble to wear on Sundays and state occasions. Possibly it may be wondered how the slippers would look after walking five or ten miles through the mud to church, as was frequently done. There were ways of doing these things that were only whispered among the girls, but have leaked out ; and the same process was indulged in more or less by young men, who were fortunate enough to own a pair of fine boots ; and that was, to wear the every-day shoes or boots, or go bare foot to within a few rods of the \"meeting house,\" and then step into the woods and take the wraps from the precious shoes and put them on. It is just barely possible there is a lady in to-day's society, who,' with five pounds of colored hemp on the back of her head and thirty-five yards of silk velvet in her train, would be uncharitable enough to laugh at these pioneer mothers and daughters ; if so, those whose opinions are worth anything fully understand that there was more work and worth, more value to the world and the community in which she lived, in the little finger of one of these pioneers than in the whole body, train, hair and all, of the aforesaid \"lady.\" By the testimony of all history, luxury tends to degeneracy. If the clothes of the pioneers were poor, they made up in brain and heart. The tables are turned \u2014 the vac uum of brain and heart is filled with fine clothes. Let it be remembered that the solidity and value of this beautiful structure called society, lies in the foundation \u2014 in the pioneer fathers and mothers, and it is only because of this solid foundation that the structure is able to stand at all. The houses, or huts, in which these pioneers lived have been often described; their form and proportions, and general appearance have been re peatedly impressed upon the mind of the student of history. They were built of round logs with the bark on, outside chimneys of mud and sticks, puncheon floors, clapboard roof, with and without a loft or second floor, and all put together without a nail or particle of iron from top to bottom. These buildings stood many a year after the original in habitant moved into better quarters. They served for stables, sheep pens, hay houses, pig pens, smith shops, hen houses, loom shops, school houses, etc. Some of them are yet standing in this county, and occupied, to some extent, in some portions of the county as dwellings. A second grade of log cabin, built later, was quite an improvement on the first, being made of hewn logs, with sawed lumber for door and window frames and floors. Glass also took the place of paper windows of the old cabin ; nails were also sparingly used in these better cabins. When nails were first used, for a few years a pound of them was exchanged for a bushel of wheat. They were a precious arti cle, and were made by hand on a blacksmith's an vil, out of odds and ends of old worn-out sickles, scythes, broken clevis pins, links of chains, broken horse-shoes, etc., all welded together to eke out the nail rods from which they were forged. The first cabins were erected ready for occupation in a single day. In an emergency, the pioneers col lected together, often going eight or ten miles to a cabin-raising, and in the great woods, where not a tree had been felled or a stone turned, began with dawn the erection of a cabin. Three or four wise builders would set the corner-stones, lay on the square and level the first round of logs; two men with axes would cut the trees and logs; one with his team of oxen, a \"lizzard\" and a log-chain would \"snake\" them in; two more, with axes, cross-cut saw and frow would make) the clapboards ; two more, with axes, cross-cut saw and broad-axe would hew out the puncheons and flatten the upper side of the sleepers and joists. Four skilful axemen would carry up the corners, and the remainder with skids and forks or hand-spikes would roll up the logs. As soon as the joists were laid on, the cross-cut saw was brought from the woods, and two men went to work cutting out the door and chim-"], [240, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 232 ney place; and while the corner men were building up the attic and putting on the roof, the carpenters and masons of the day were putting down the pun cheons, laying the hearth and building the chimney high enough to keep out the beasts, wild or tame. In one corner, at a distance of six feet from one wall, and four from the other the bed post is placed \u2014 only one being needed. A hole is bored in the puncheon floor for the purpose of setting this post (which is usually a stick with a crotch or fork in the upper end) in ; or if any auger is not at hand, a hole is cut in the puncheon floor and the fork sharpened and driven into the ground beneath; rails are laid from this fork to the wall, and usually season than shelter; but when the first frost came, a sure indication of approaching winter, active preparations were made for the permanent cabin, and the work was pushed forward until a snug cabin stood in the midst of the forest, with a clearing around it, made principally by cutting down the trees for the building. Every crack was chinked and daubed with ordinary clay mixed with water, and when completed, and a fire of hickory logs in the great fire-place, no amount of cold could seriously disturb the inmates. The heavy door was hung on wooden hinges, and all that was necessary to lock it at night was to pull the latch-string inside, and the strong wooden latch held it fast against THE HOME OF A PIONEER, nice, straight hickory poles form the bottom, upon which straw or leaves are placed and the blanket put on. This makes a comfortable spring bed and is easily changed and kept clean. Often the chinking and daubing of the walls, putting in windows and hanging the door were left until fall or some leisure time after the corn crop and the contents of the truck patch were secured. Often the pioneer did not erect a cabin at all until a crop was secured \u2014 living, meanwhile, in their covered wagons, and cooking beside a log in the open air, or erecting a \"pole cabin,\" or \"brush cabin,\" mere temporary affairs, to shelter the family until time could be had for erecting a permanent one. The saving of the crop was of more importance during the summer wild animals or storms. Thieves there were none, and even had there been, there was nothing in the hut of a settler to tempt their cupidity. Many of these cabins have no loft or second floor, but when this was added it was used as a sleeping room for the younger members of the family, and as a gen eral store-room for the household goods, and often for the corn crop and the contents of the truck patch. Regarding the furniture of these cabins, Judge Johnson says: \"The furniture of the backwoods matched the architecture well. There were a few quaint specimens of cabinet work drag ged into the wilderness, but these were sporadic and not com mon. I can best describe it by what I saw in my father's house. First of all a table had to be improvised, and there was no"], [241, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 233 cabinet-maker to make it, and no lumber to make it of. Our floor was laid with broad chestnut puncheons, well and smoothe ly hewn, for the obsolete art of hewing timber was then in its prime. Father took one of these puncheons, two feet and a half broad, putting two narrow ones in its place, bored four large augur holes and put in four legs, or round poles with the bark on. On this hospitable board many a wholesome meal was spread, and many an honest man, and many a wayworn stranger ate his fill and was grateful. \"On great occasions, when an extension table was needed, the door was lifted off its hinges and added to the puncheon- What we sat upon at first I cannot conjecture ; but I remember well when my father loaded his horses down with wheat and corn, and crossed the country a distance of eight or ten miles. and brought home, in exchange, a set of oak splint-bottomed chairs, some of which are intact to this day. Huge band-boxes made of blue-ash bark, supplied the place of bureaus and ward robes ; and a large tea-chest, cut in two, and hung by strings in the corners, with the hollow sides outward, constituted the bookcases. A respectable old bed-stead, still in the family, was lugged across from Red Stone. An old turner and wheelwright added a trundle-bed, and the rest were hewn and whittled out according to the fashion of the times, to serve their day and be supplanted by others as the civilization of the country advanced. \"But the grand flourish of furniture was the dresser. Here were spread out, in grand display, pewter dishes, pewter plates, pewter basins and pewter spoons, scoured as bright as silver, as who should say\u2014 'that woman's daughter will make you a good wife, my boy.' \"Money was scarce, but our fathers learned to live without it. All was barter. The preacher's stipend, the lawyer's fee, the schoolmaster's salary, the workman's wages, the shoemaker's account, the tailor's bill were all paid in barter. ' ' I have seen my father, when he had a surplus of grain and a deficit of pigs, fill two sacks of corn, and on the backs of two horses, carry it to a distant part of the neighborhood and ex change it for four shoats, and in each sack thrust one shoat tail foremost and another head foremost, tie up the mouths of the sacks, mount them on horseback, rip a hole in the seam of the sack for each snout to stick out, and bring them home to be fattened for next year's pork. Here was a currency\u2014 a denom ination of greenbacks which neither required the pen of the Chancellor of the Exchecquer to make it legal tender, nor the judgment of the Chief J ustice to declare it constitu. tional. The law of necessity governs in every case, and wise men may fret every hair off their heads without changing the results.\" At a little later time, say from 1820 to 1840, the pioneers were living a little easier! Their farms were partially cleared, many of them were living in hewed log houses and many in frame and even brick houses. Most of them had barns and in numerable out-houses. They generally had cattle, horses, sheep, hogs and poultry, and were living in comparative comfort. Their neighbors were near and always dear. Their schools and churches had improved somewhat, yet even at this late day there were hundreds of log school-houses and churches. About three months in a.year was all the school- ing a farmer's boy could get. He was sadly needed at home from the age of five years, to do all sorts of chores and work on the farm. He was wanted to drive the cows to water and to pasture; to feed the pigs and chickens and gather the eggs. His duties in the summer were multifarious ; the men were at work in the field harvesting, and generally worked from early morning until late at night, and the boys were depended on to \"do the chores;\" hence it was impossible to spare them to attend school in summer. There was no school in spring and fall. In winter they were given three months' schooling \u2014 a very poor article of schooling, too, generally. Their books were generally anything they happened to have about the house, and even as late as 1850, there was no system in the pur- chase of school books. Mr. Smucker says his first reading books at school were Patrick Gass' Journal of the Lewis and Clark expedition to the mouth of the Columbia river in 1804-5-6; and Weem's Life of Washington. Parents of children bought what- ever book pleased their fancy, or whatever the children desired them to purchase. A geography- was a geography, and a grammar a grammar, re- gardless of who was the author. This great con- fusion in school books made trouble for the teacher, but that was of small moment. He was hired and paid to teach whatever branches, out of whatever books the parents thought was best. The branches generally taught in the early schools, however, were reading, writing, spelling and arith- metic, and, later, geography and grammar. Boys attending school but three months in a year made but little progress. They began at the beginning of their books every winter, and went as far as they could in three months ; then forgot it all dur- ing the nine months out of school, commencing again the next winter just where they commenced the previous one. In this way they went over and over the same lessons every year under different teachers (for many of the teachers only taught one term in a place), often getting no further in arith- metic than \"vulgar fractions\" or the \"rule of three,\" and in their old Webster's spelling books the first class probably got as far as \"antiscorbu tic\" and may be through; while the second class would get as far as \"cessation,\" and the third class"], [242, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 234 probably not through 'i baker,\" certainly not be yond \"amity.\" There were always three or four classes in spelling, and this exercise was the last before school was dismissed in the evening. Their old books were conned over year after year until they were worn out and the children grew up to manhood and womanhood, and never knew, and perhaps do not know to this day, what was in the back part of them. That was the kind of a start many a great man had. These schools cannot be despised when it is remembered that the greatest and best of the nation, including such men as Abraham Lincoln, Edwin M. Stanton and Stephen A. Douglas, were among the boys who attended them. There was always much competition in the spell ing classes as to who should get the \"head mark.\" In the later schools it was the custom that the best speller might stand at the head until he missed, when the one who spelled the word correctly should take his place, and he then stood next to the head ; but they did things differently in the earlier schools, the head of the class once gained and held until the last spelling at night, the head mark was re ceived and the lucky scholar then took his place at the foot of the class, to again work his way gradu ally to the head. These classes sometimes con tained thirty or forty scholars, and it was some thing of an undertaking to get from the foot to the head. Spelling-schools were the beauty and glory of school-days. The scholars were always coaxing the teacher to appoint a night for a spelling-school, and were usually gratified one or two nights in a month or oftener. A night was chosen when the moon shone, and the sleighing was good, and then the entire neighborhood and perhaps the adjoin ing neighborhood would turn out to the spelling school ; whole families came on the great two-horse sled, including the old lady and gentleman, all the children, little and big; even the baby and the dogs came. Schools in adjoining districts sent their best spellers to try and carry off the honors. The old log school-house was crowded, and the great box stove, cast at the Mary Ann furnace, and which stood in the center of the room on a box of bricks, was red hot, and kept so during the entire evening. Two good spellers were designated by the teacher to choose sides, and everybody was chosen in one class or the other; then the spelling began, the words being given out by the teacher, first to one class then to the other, beginning at the head. A tally sheet was carefully kept to see who missed the most words. After recess the \"spelling down\" was indulged in; the two classes stood up, and whenever a word was missed the speller sat down, and the one who stood up after all had been spelled down, was the hero or heroine of the hour, and always chosen first in future con tests. The result was that the participants usually became correct orthographers. The following poem, originally published in the Cincinnati Chronicle in 1833, portrays so graphic ally life in a log cabin, that it is eminently worthy of preservation. Although written by a \"Hoosier\" and intended to portray Hoosier life, it applies equally well to log cabin life everywhere. -'Suppose, in riding through the West, A stranger found a ' Hoosier's nest,' In other words a buckeye cabin Just big enough to hold Queen Mab in; Its situation low but airy, Was on the borders of a prairie. And searing he might be benighted, He hailed the house and then alighted. The 'Hoosier' met him at the door, Their salutations soon were o'er; He took the stranger's horse aside And to a sturdy sapling tied, Then having stripped the saddle off, He fed him in a sugar trough. The stranger stooped to enter in, The entrance closing with a pin, And manifested a strong desire To seat himself by the log-heap fire, Where half a dozen Hoosieroons, With mush and milk, tin-cups and spoons, White heads, bar; feet, and dirty faces, Seemed much inclined to keep their places. But madam anxious to display Her rough and undisputed sway, Her offspring to the ladder led And cuffed the youngster up to bed. Invited shortly, to partake Of venison, milk and Johnny cake, The stranger made a hearty meal, And glances round the room would steal. One side was lined with divers garments, The other spread with skins of ' varments ; ' Dried pumpkins overhead were strung, Where venison hams in plenty hung; Two rifles were placed above the door, Three dogs lay stretched upon the floor \u2014 In short, the domicile was rife With specimens of Hoosier life."], [243, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 235 The host, who centered his affections On game, and range and quaner sections, Discoursed his weary guest for hours, Till Somnus' ever potent powers.

THE following notice appeared in the papers of Newark, of April 20, 1867. \"The undersigned citizens of Licking county are impressed with the importance of preserving accurate and full descriptions of the antiquities and ancient works of our county, many of which have already been partially or wholly obliterated ; and they also deem it equally important to collect and preserve all the leading facts and incidents connected with the early settlement of the different sections of Licking county, by neighborhoods and townships. This work, if done at all, must be done largely by the present generation. If not done, soon important facts in our history will be lost and we will have only the unreliable vagueness of uncertain tradition instead of authenticated truthful history. \"We, therefore, with a view to the accomplishment of these purposes, calljupon all our fellow-citizens, of concurrent opinions, to meet with us at the court house on Wednesday evening, May 1st, at eight o'clock, then and there to consider and discuss the important matter herein presented.

JOHNNY APPLESEED. \" Give fools their gold, and knaves their power; Let fortune's bubbles rise and fall; Who sows a field, or trains a flower, Or plants a tree, is more than all.\" \u2014 Whittier. A HISTORY of Ohio and especially of Licking xx county, would be incomplete without some account of this very eccentric individual, known as Johnny Appleseed, from the fact that he was the pioneer nursery man of Ohio. Johnny Appleseed deserves a place in history among the heroes and martyrs, for he was both in his peculiar calling. His whole life was devoted to what he considered the public good, without re gard to personal feeling, or hope of pecuniary re ward. Not once in a century is such a life of self-sacrifice for the good of others known. There has been but one Johnny Appleseed; it is hardly possible there will ever be another. He was born, according to one or two authori ties, in Massachusetts, about the year 1775; was first heard of in Ohio about the year 1S01, and was known to have traversed Licking county soon thereafter, The date of his birth is shrouded in uncertainty. Mr. C. S. Coffinberry writes the following regarding this matter: \"He was born in the State of Massachusetts, but at what period the writer never knew. As early as 1780, he was seen in the autumn, for two or three successive years, along the banks of the Potomac river, in eastern Virginia.\" If this be true, he must have been born some years before 1775. Why he left his native State and devoted his life to the planting of apple-seeds in the west, is known only to himself. He may have been insane ; he was generally so considered to a certain degree. He was certainly eccentric, as many people are who are not considered insane ; it is hard to trace eccentricity to the point where insanity begins. He was certainly smart enough to keep his own coun- sel. Without doubt his was a very affectionate nature; every act of his life reveals this most prominent characteristic. From this fact alone writers have reasoned, and with good ground, that he was crossed in love in his native State, and thus they account for his eccentricity. This is only supposition, however, as he was very reticent on the subject of his early life. He was conscien tious in every act and thought, and a man of deep religious convictions. He was a rigid Swedenbor gian, and maintained the doctrine that spiritual in tercourse could be held with departed spirits; in-' deed, was in frequent intercourse himself with two of these spirits of the female gender, who consoled him with the news that they were to be his wives in the future state, should he keep himself from all entangling alliances in this. So kind and sim ple was his heart that he was equally welcome with the Indians or pioneers, and even the wild- animals of the woods seemed to have an understanding with Johnny and never molested him. He has been variously described, but all agree that he was rather below the medium height, wiry, quick in action and conversation, nervous and restless in his motions; eyes dark and sparkling; hair and beard generally long, but occasionally cut short; dress scanty, and \"generally ragged and patched; generally barefooted and bareheaded, occasionally, however, wearing some old shoes, sandals or moc casins in very cold weather, and an old hat some one had cast off. It is said he was seen sometimes with a tin pan on his head, that served the double purpose of hat and mush-pot, at other times with a cap made by himself of paste-board, with a very broad visor to protect his eyes from the sun. His diet was very simple, consisting of milk, when he could get it, of which he was very fond; potatoes and other vegetables, fruits, and meats; but no veal, as he said this should be a land flow-"], [248, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 240 ing with milk and honey, and the calves should be spared. He would not touch tea, coffee or tobac co, as he felt that these were luxuries in which it was wicked and injurious to indulge. He was averse to taking the life of any animal or insect, and never indulged in hunting with a gun. He thought himself \"a messenger, sent into the wilderness to prepare the way for the people, as John the Baptist was sent to prepare the way for the coming of the Saviour.\" He gathered his apple seeds, little by little, from the cider presses of western Pennsylvania and putting them carefnlly in leather bags, he transported them, sometimes on his back, and sometimes on the back of a broken down horse or mule, to the Ohio river, where he usually secured a boat and brought them to the mouth of the Muskingum, and up that river, plant ing them in wild, secluded spots all along its numer ous tributaries. Later in life, he continued his operations further west. When his trees were ready for sale, he left them in charge of some one to sell for him. The price was low \u2014 \"a fippenny-bit\" apiece, rarely paid in money, and if people were too poor to purchase, the trees were given them. One of his nurseries was located on the farm of the late Judge Wilson, in Mary Ann township. His residence in this vicinity covered the period of the war of 1812, and several years following it. He would occasionally make trips further west, and return again after an absence of two or three months. On these excursions he probably visited his sister, Persis Broom, who lived in Indiana. Mr. C. S. Coffinberry, an early settler of Mansfield, Ohio, who was personally acquainted with him, writes thus: \"Although I was but a mere child, I can remember as if it were but yesterday, the warning cry of Johnny Appleseed, as he stood before my father's log cabin door on that night \u2014 the cabin stood where now stands the old North American in the city of Mansfield. I remember the precise lauguage, the clear, loud voice, the deliberate exclamations, and the fearful thrill it awoke in my bosom. ' Fly ! fly ! for your lives! the Indians are murdering and scalping the Zimmers and Copuses.' These were his words. My father sprang to the door, but the messenger was gone, and midnight silence reigned without. * * * Jonathan Chapman was a regularly con- stituted minister of the church of the New Jerusa lem, according to the revelations of Emanuel Swe denborg. He was also a constituted missionary of that faith under the authority of the regular asso ciation in the city of Boston. The writer has seen and examined his credentials as to the latter of these.\" He always carried in his pockets books and tracts relating to his religion, and took great delight in reading them to others and scattering them about. When he did not have enough with him to go around, he would take the books apart and distribute them in pieces. It does not appear that he operated as largely in this county as in those further north, and es pecially those immediately bordering on the Mus kingum. In Knox, Ashland and Richland coun ties he was well known, and many old settlers yet remember him. He had nurseries near Mt. Vernon, and several in Richland county. He often visited Hon. William Stanberry, and always manifested his eccentricities by sleeping out on the porch. Being once interrogated as to his views about \"hell,\" he replied that he thought it resembled Newark, except that it was on a larger scale. Mrs. Stadden, who knew him well, did not think much of him ; however this might be, he did a great deal of good. Besides the cultivation of apple-trees, he was extensively engaged in scattering the seeds of many wild vegetables, which he supposed possessed me dicinal qualities, such as dog-fennel, penny-royal, may-apple, hoarhound, catnip, wintergreen, etc. His object was to equalize the distribution, so that every locality would have a variety. His opera tions in Indiana began about 1836, and were continued for ten years, In the spring of 1847, being within fifteen miles of one of his nurseries on the St. Joseph river, word was brought to him that cattle had broken into this nursery and were de stroying his trees, and he started immediately for the place. When he arrived he was very much fatigued; being quite advanced in years, the jour ney, performed without intermission, exhausted his strength. He lay down that night never to rise again. A fever settled upon him, and, in a day or two after taking sick, he passed away. \"We buried him,\" says Mr. Worth, \"in David Archer's grave yard, two and a half miles north of Fort Wayne.\""], [249, "CHAPTER XXIX.

Phillips and his two younger 1 brothers, Thomas and Erasmus, sons of Thomas Phillips, a Welshman of large fortune, were students at a college in Wales. John H. was the reputed author of some seditious or treasonable literature, and, to avoid arrest and punishment, he decided to emigrate to America. Accordingly he sailed for Philadelphia, accompanied by his broth- ers, who were more or less implicated with him, ar riving in the above named year. They soon went to live in a Welsh settlement in Chester county, in the vicinity of Philadelphia. Here they met with Chaplain Jones, a Welsh minister, a sketch of whose life appears elsewhere. General Anthony Wayne was also a resident of Chester county, and when he organized the expedition against the In- dians in the Northwest territory, in 1792, through the influence of Chaplain Jones he appointed John H. Phillips a member of his staff. These sons of Thomas Phillips succeeded, after much persuasion, in obtaining the consent of their father, who was a man of wealth, to close his busi- ness affairs and follow them to America. Mr. Theophilus Rees, a neighbor and friend 6? Thomas Phillips, both residents of Carmarthen shire, in South Wales, who likewise was a man of liberal means, after a full consideration of the sub ject, also decided to try his fortune in the New World, and forthwith proceeded to make arrange ments to that end. They accordingly closed up their business, and, when that was accomplished, they bade adieu to their native hills in \"Wild Walia,\" and sailed in the ship Amphion, Captain Williams, April i, 1795 (or, as some accounts have it, 1796), for the United States, where they arrived after a passage of nine weeks. Many of their old Welsh neighbors, by arrange ment, through the kind generosity of Messrs. Rees and Phillips, came as emigrants in the same ship with them, though many of them were unable to pay their passage, but agreeing to do so upon earning money enough after their arrival here. In October after their arrival, most of this colo ny removed to Big Valley, in Chester county, Penn sylvania, where there was a Welsh settlement. Messrs. Rees and Phillips resided some time in or near Philadelphia; but both removed to the Welsh settlement in Chester county, Pennsylvania. Here, however, they did not remain long, but soon, probably in 1797, together with others who had crossed the Atlantic with them, removed to Bulah, Cambria county, Pennsylvania, where they formed a portion of a considerable Welsh settlement. In this community Mr. Phillips' son, Thomas, w-ho came over in 1787, died in i8or. The other son, Erasmus, died in Philadelphia some years later. In 1801, or earlier, when all this county consti tuted Licking township, Fairfield county, Thomas Phillips and Theophilus Rees purchased two thous-"], [250, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 242 and acres of land situated in what is now the northeast quarter of Granville township. It bor dered on the McKean township line and extended almost to. Newark township. They purchased this land of Mr. Sampson Davis, a Welshman of Phila delphia, who was then an extensive dealer in west ern lands. The purchase was made upon condi tion that the land proved as represented, the pur chasers not having seen it. Chaplain Jones, Mor gan Rees, and Simon James were selected to view the land. They accepted the commission, dis charged the duty assigned them, and, upon their report, the contract was ratified. Mr. Rees and his son-in-law, David Lewis, visited this purchase in i So i. In 1 80 1 David Lewis and David Thomas, left Bulah, Pennsylvania, to settle on the Welsh Hills. On arriving at Marietta they found stonemasons' work and remained until the spring of 1802, when they came up the Muskingum and during said year built cabins on the Welsh Hills. In the same year Mr. Theophilus Rees with his family, and Simon James without his family, left their homes in Bulah, Cambria county, Pennsylvania, for the purpose of permanently occupying and improving the Welsh Hills purchase. Mr. James was to build a cabin on the Phillips tract, clear some land, then return to Cambria, which he did. He, however, removed, with his family, to the Welsh Hills settlement in T804. Upon the arrival of this colony of emigrants at or near Wheeling, they fell in with a frontiersman, hunter, scout and Indian fighter named Jimmy Johnson, who felt quite willing to be transferred to regions further west, as his business had become very dull in that section. Mr. Rees thinking that an expert in those occu pations, and a man of such diversified genius and talents might be useful to him in his wilderness home, engaged him to accompany him, agreeing to sell him one hundred acres of land, to be paid for in such services as he might be able to render. David Thomas stopped in Newark, and lived in a cabin on the Park House lot until he could build a cabin on his land, when, late in the same year, or early in 1803, he removed to the Welsh Hills and occupied his cabin. Mr. David Lewis, also, stopped in Newark and worked as a stone mason, but his father-in-law, Theophilus Rees, having given him one hundred acres of his land, Mr. Lewis soon took measures to occupy it, and with the help of Patrick Cun ningham and his sons, erected a cabin upon it. This cabin was probably erected in 1802. But Theophilus Rees, Simon James, and Jimmy Johnson, established themselves on the Hills in 1802; Mr. Rees most likely temporarily occupying, with a portion of his family and laborers, until a better one could be erected; and Messrs. John son, Thomas and Lewis constructing cabins for themselves and families, Simon James' occupancy, however, in accordance with the or iginal intention, was only temporary. Theophilus Rees, David Lewis, David Thomas, Simon James, and Jimmy Johnson were the Welsh Hills pioneers. Thomas was afterward known as \" Big Davy Thomas,\" to distinguish him from a smaller man of the same name, who was also a son-in-law of Theophilus Rees, and who, in 1810, settled on the purchase of Mr. Rees, he having been presented with one hundred acres of it. Theophilus Rees, the patriarch of the Welsh Hills, was a gentleman and a scholar; a man of integrity and great usefulness to his countrymen and his church. He spoke the English language imperfectly, but after the arrival of the Granville colony in 1805, he was a regular attendant upon the services of the church in Granville until the organization of the Welsh Hills church in r8o8. John H. Phillips, the youthful sedtitious writer, who left his country to secure his own safety, ar rived for the first time on the Welsh Hills in 1803, or the year after, but remained only a short time. He returned to Chester county, where his family lived, and superintended the construction of a bridge over the Schuylkill near Philadelphia. In 1806 he returned to the Welsh Hills, where he taught school, and made himself generally useful for eight years, when he removed to Cincinnati where he died in 1832. He was one of the earli est school teachers in the Welsh Hills, and a man of fair abilities, good scholarship, and made his mark wherever he went. He held some official positions in Cincinnati, and was highly esteemed there. Thomas Phillips was largely engaged in business"], [251, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 243 in Cambria county, Pennsylvania, and moving on his land immediately was found impracticable. He, however, visited it in 1804, accompanied by his wife, whose adaptation to frontier life, business capacity, energy and force of character were pro verbial. They remained some time, and then re turned to Cambria county, with a determination to bring their business affairs there to a close. This was accomplished in two years; and in 1806 Thomas Phillips and family returned to the Welsh Hills where he lived until his death, which occur red May 26, 1813. Mrs. Phillips died some years before in Philadelphia, whither she had gone on business. Mr. Phillips, like his neighbor and friend, Deacon Rees, was a well educated gentleman of large ex perience and extensive information and reading. In 1803 James Evans, James James, and a Mr. Shadwick who, however, was not a Welshman, set tled on the Welsh Hills. Thomas Cramer, son-in-law of Jimmy Johnson, and his brother, Peter Cramer, came from West Virginia in 1804, as did also Mr. Simon James, who, two years before, accompanied the Rees colony. During the years 1805 and 1806, John Price, Benjamin Jones, John H. Phillips and Thomas Powell were added to the list of Welsh men in the Welsh Hills' settlement. Samuel J. Phillips and Thomas Owens were among the Welsh settlers of 1807 and 1808; Jacob Reily and a Mr. McLane, not Welshmen, were immigrants of the same year. Morris Morris, David James and Joseph Evans, father of Joseph and Lewis, of Newark, came in 1809; and \"little\" David Thomas, son-in-law of Theophilus Rees, and Mr. Samuel White, sr., came in 1810. Mr. White was a son-in-law of Thomas Phillips, and though not a Welshman, albeit his wife was a native of Wales, he yet became very closely identi fied with the history of the Welsh Hills' settlement. He was born March 4, 1762, in Peterborough, near Boston, in Massachusetts, and entered college upon reaching manhood; but before the comple tion of his college course, he commenced a sea faring career which he pursued for twelve years. He visited the four quarters of the globe while a seaman, and during the time, was shipwrecked near Cape Horn. He thereupon resolved to abandon the life of a sailor, and returning to Phil adelphia, entered the service of Thomas Phillips as a teamster in 1797. Mr. Phillips was running a wagon line between Philadelphia and Cambria county. Mr. White, in the same year, married the daughter of his employer, and in 18 10, removed to the Welsh Hills. Soon after his arrival the large hearted settlers of the \"Hills\" met in force, and welcomed the newcomer by building him a cabin. These pioneers spent their Christmas of 1810, in this delightful and hospitable way, finishing the cabin ready for its occupant the same day. Mr. White was a man of more than ordinary in telligence and education; possessing an inquisitive mind, and an independent, frank, upright char acter. He was the father of a number of sons, and died September 13, 185T, at the ripe age of eighty-nine. Jonathan White, son of the foregoing, was born in Cambria county in 1 800, and came to the Welsh Hills with his father in 18 10. He became a good scholar under the teaching of Rev. Thos. D. Baird, of Newark, and was a young man of very fine talents, excelling in oratory. He died in 1827, in Stark county, Ohio, where he was engaged as canal contractor. Samuel White, jr., was born in the Welsh Hills settlement, March 3, 181 2. He was the first stu dent on the list on the first day of the first term of Granville college. He remained there some time, but difficulties, growing out of the discussion of the slavery question, led him to complete his education at Oberlin. Leaving college in 1836, he entered the law office of the late Colonel Mathiot, and was admitted to the bar in 1837. In 1843 ne was a successful candidate for the State legislature and became a leader in that body. In 1844 he received the nomination of the Whig party for Congress in the district composed of the counties of Knox, Licking and Franklin, in opposition to Colonel C. J. McNulty, one of the most able and accomplished stump speakers and political campaigners in Ohio. They conducted the canvass with extraordinary vigor, and it is generally conceded that it was owing to the herculean labors of Mr. White during this campaign that he contracted a fever which so utterly prostrated him as to end in his death, which oc curred July 20, 1844. Columbus Delano took his"], [252, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 244 place on the ticket, and was elected by a majority of twelve votes. Samuel White, jr., for some time edited, in part, the Newark Gazette; but in this vocation it cannot be said that he exhibited extraordinary ability. He was not remarkable as a writer. He made the re- ception speech in 1843, on the occasion of the ar- rival of John Quincy Adams in Newark, which w-as universally conceded to have been a preeminent success. He was a man of remarkable force and power as a public speaker. It is undoubtedly true that his equal as an orator, before a promiscuous assembly, and in cases of a certain kind before a jury, has never been produced in this county. His sarcasm was withering; his invective powerful. He was exceedingly ready and pointed in repartee, and of very great severity in his strictures upon party measures and party leaders. In declamatory har- angues and satirical oratory he was perfectly over- whelming. In aptness of scriptural quotations he could not be excelled. To work up an audience to the fever heat of excitement, and to sway the multitude by inflammatory appeals, were to him matters of easy accomplishment. He was indeed ' a man of wonderful power, and his early death is probably all that prevented him from taking a front rank among the popular orators of America. In logical argumentation, in philosophical reasoning, in legal acumen or ability he did not excel, but in the elements of a popular stump orator, young as he was, he has had but few equals and fewer superiors. Many still remember that he and B. B. Taylor, a Democrat, made much music of the rambling, dis- cordant sort, during the famous log cabin and hard cider campaign of 1840. They were often pitted against each other in the three or four subsequent contests, producing uniformly music of the harsh- est sort. Samuel White was fearless, independent, out- spoken, frank, honest, never uttering opinions he did not believe, and always gave expression to thoughts he entertained, without \"fear, favor or affection.\" In the famous crusades of his times against slavery and intemperance, he was always in the front rank, playing well the part of Richard, the lion-hearted. He asserted the right of free discussion \u2014 in- deed he became the acknowledged champion of freedom of press and speech, and more than once braved ignorant, infuriated, brutal mobs, who tyranically denied the liberty of speech. He never shrank from the open avowal of his sentiments under any amount of popular odium, and therein he attained, in those heroic times, to the highest point of independent manhood. Mr. Isaac Smucker, speaking of him politically, says : \"He and I held opposing political opinions, but we were in harmony on the question of the right of free discussion, and now, after he has been a tenant of the tomb more than a third of a century, I avail myself, with the highest degree of pleasure, of the opportunity to bear testimony to one of nature's highly gifted ones, with whom I was not in political harmony, and sometimes not on terms of friendly personal relations. But he ' had a noble nature and was, therefore, placable, forgiving, gen erous, magnanimous.\" A Welshman, who passed current on the \"Hills\" as Dr. Thomas, settled there about the year 1834. He derived most of his consequence from the fact that he placed five sons in the Baptist ministry, who were all more or less distinguished. They were named David, John, Benjamin, Daniel and Evan, and all entered the pulpit very young. David, the eldest, was, for a number of years, pastor of the church in Newark, as was also Ben jamin. David was a man of wonderful volubility in the pulpit, and stood in the first class of the school known as \"revival orators.\" His brothers, also, had similar gifts, and all were liberally en dowed with talents as public speakers. They were remarkable men, whose fame spread abroad, and who made considerable stir in the world as pulpit orators of more than average natural powers. They never enjoyed superior educational advan tages, nor attained to any distinction in scholar ship. From the foregoing it will be seen that the pur chase of Messrs. Rees and Phillips formed the nucleus of the Welsh settlement in this county. Theophilus Rees settled on his half of the pur chase, and surrounded himself by his sons, The ophilus and John, and his sons-in-law, the two David Thomas', and David Lewis, and his hunter, \"Jimmy Johnson,\" giving to each of them about one hundred acres of his land. Mr. Thomas Phillips settled upon his portion of the purchase, and likewise surrounded himself by his sons, John H. and Samuel J., and his sons-in-"], [253, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 245 law, Thomas Owens, Samuel White, William Mor rison and John Evans. To all of them he gave one hundred acres of land, but the two last named sons-in-law did not occupy their land. Morrison lived on land in the vicinity, but Evans never came to Licking county. To a granddaughter Mr. Phil lips gave two hundred acres of land, but she never occupied it. It is impracticable to give the names of the emi grants from Wales who settled in this county sub sequent to 1810. Additions were made to their number from year to year, so that, notwithstanding the numerous deaths and removals, the number of Welsh inhabitants in Licking county, including those who are in whole or in part of Welsh parent age, cannot be much less than twenty-five hundred at the present time. They live principally in the Welsh Hills settlement, and in the city of Newark, and village of Granville. Of those immigrants from Wales, who settled in the Hills subsequent to 18 10, there were Daniel Griffith (18 12), Walter and Nicodemus Griffith (1815), David Pittsford (18 16), and Hugh Jones (1819). Edward Price and Edward Glenn came in 182 1, and Rev. Thomas Hughes in 1822. Of those members of the families of Messrs. Rees and Phillips, who came from Wales in 1795, Mrs. Elizabeth Thomas, wife of \"Little\" David Thomas, and daughter of Theophilus Rees, was the last survivor. She died May 3, 1855, after a residence in America of sixty years. The portion of Licking county in which the first Welsh settlers located, has ever since been known and designated as the .\"Welsh Hills settle- ment.\" It was originally limited to the northeast quarter of Granville township, but the settlement gradually extended in all directions, and its pres- ent boundaries, though somewhat indefinite, may be given with some degree of approximation to accuracy. It is mainly in the townships of New- ark and Granville, but extends slightly into the townships of Newton and McKean. It begins at Sharon valley, at a point about two miles north- west of Newark, and extends in a northwesterly direction into McKean township, and is between five and six miles long. It has a width of four miles or more, extending on the northeast into Newton township; its southwestern boundary be ing in Granville township, near the village of Gran ville. It is all between the road running north from Newark to Utica and that running west to Alexandria. The country embraced in this settlement, be longs to the class known as \"hilly,\" but it may be regarded as fertile, particularly in the production of cereals. It was originally all heavily timbered, but is now mostly cleared land. Farms are not generally large, and timber for present and pros pective purposes is found on each of them with rare exceptions. A considerable quantity of level or slightly un dulating land is found on most of the farms, which produces corn and the different varieties of grasses well. Soft water springs abound, and it may be considered one of the best watered sec tions of the county, although the streams are small. The settlement has always been regarded as one of rare salubriousness ; healthfulness being the rule among the hardy, robust inhabitants, and sick ness-the exception. The earliest settlers on the Welsh Hills endured great hardships and privations, both in reaching their wild western homes, and during the first few years after their arrival. They had to cut out roads to enable them to get to their land with wheeled vehicles ; and the roads over which they traveled from the Ohio river, were of recent con struction, and but little better than trails through the woods. The)- generally came in wagons, but a few are said to have brought their families in canoes to Zanesville. Indians often visited the Welsh settlers in early times, but the)- were not hostile. A sort of a chief named \"Big Joe,\" and a few of his followers were frequently visitors at the house of David Lewis, and are still distinctly remembered by one of the mem bers of his family, Mrs. Ann Cunningham, wife and John Cunningham, and who was often present during their visitations. They did no particular harm, but frightened the women and children, and were not, therefore, welcome visitors. Wolves were very troublesome to the Welsh pio neers, as well as all other pioneers of this county. It is related of the son of Theophilus Rees,"], [254, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 246 that world-wide renowned institution, the American common school \u2014 that entering wedge for civiliza tion \u2014 was established in and around this settle ment. Many of the older persons of this settle ment never acquired a knowledge of the English language, but their children and grandchildren did, and gradually that language worked its way through the entire settlement. All their descen dants of the present generation both understand and speak it with facility, and receive most of their education and training in it. Religious instruction is still continued in their own language, in three churches in Granville township and two in the city of Newark. The Welsh pioneers and their descendants, as well as the present Welsh population of Licking county, may be characterized as pre-eminently re ligious, adhering, generally, either to the Baptist, Methodist or Congregational churches. They are, with rare exceptions, Calvinistic in their views, holding those peculiar tenets, probably, in their milder forms. They are Calvinists, at all events, whether Baptists, Methodists or Congregationalists. Probably a larger proportion of them are church goers and church-members, than is to be found among any other nationalities, native or foreign. They spend very much more time in their churches for the purpose of receiving and impart ing religious instruction, and for devotional exer cises, than is usual with other churches and w-ith other classes of citizens : neither are they surpassed by other churches, or systems of moral training, in their efforts at, and success in, developing a high order of consistent Christian character. They sus tain five churches in this county exclusively, be sides forming an integral portion of a number of others, in which they receive religious instruction in the English language. Prominent among these is the Welsh Hills Baptist church, organized with Welsh members in a great part, and since, mostly sustained by them. The Welsh are, also, generally friends of tem perance. When the Maine law was in issue in 1853, they were its unflinching friends, and have always been opposed to free drinking. They were especially zealous during the Washingtonian move ment in 1841, and for several subsequent years. During all the weary years in which the fierce that on one occasion, when some distance from the house in the night, a pack of wolves sur rounded and treed him, and then proceeded to gnaw at the trunk of the small tree, and make other menacing demonstrations as he sat on the lower limb. Fortunately their progress was ar rested by some of the settlers, who were drawn thither by the unusually fierce howlings of the hungry beasts. On frequent occasions in the night, the wolves would gather in force around persons passing from one cabin to another, who had to be relieved by their friends armed with guns and torches. Mrs. Cunningham, above mentioned, states that one night while her brothers, sons of David Lewis, and herself, were engaged in boiling sugar water, near their father's house, a pack of wolves sur rounded them, and made such threatening dem onstrations as to render it necessary for their parents to disperse them, which they did by the aid of fire-brands and perhaps powder and lead. They were held at bay by the children, by the free use of fire-brands, but the almost entire exhaustion of these brands before the arrival of assistance, rendered their position extremely perilous. Bears were numerous, and there were a few panthers, both very formidable foes. Most of these Welsh emigrants, had a limited knowledge of the English language; they also tena ciously maintained the necessity and importance of perpetuating their own language. In this, however, they did not differ from the Germans and other foreigners. Settled together, on contiguous tracts of land, and forming a community by themselves, they were enabled for many years to carry out their wishes in this regard, and the Welsh language, and no other, continued to be spoken in many of these families for a long series of years. The views these people entertained; their inability to converse in English, and the utter ignorance of the Welsh lan guage on the part of those composing contiguous neighborhoods, made their condition, of necessity, one of isolation and apparent exclusiveness, or, as it appeared, clanishness. But if this was a fault, it grew out of the necessities of their condition. Free intercourse with their American fellow-set tlers was at first, and for many years, almost impos- sible, and this condition of things continued until"], [255, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 247 battle between slavery and freedom was raging, this Welsh population stood with great unanimity on the side of freedom. When protection and free trade were contending for supremacy in the governmental policy, the Welsh voters generally rallied under the protection flag. When the Federal Union was imperiled by trai tors, they were almost universally loyal to the government that had given them freedom and pro tection, and many of them went forth to deadly con flict on the battle-field. But few of them, if any, to their honor be it spoken, gave manifestations of sympathy with treason during the devastating war made by traitors in the interest of slavery, and against the government. The Welshmen of Lick ing were patriots, and many of them offered up their lives as a sacrifice upon the altar of their country. They have always given encouragement to schools and other agencies for mental and moral improvement. They are accustomed to read, re flect, reason and mature their opinions, and when formed, they adhere to them with great tenacity \u2014 indeed they are proverbial for firmness, unyielding determination and decision of character. They hold their opinions because they believe them to be correct, and they never give them up for the sake of accommodation. They are positive men \u2014 men of strong convictions, that cannot be surrendered to please anybody. They have always been up to the average standard of intelligence and general information. Sustaining, as they do, churches, schools, and the press, they could not fail to reach a good degree of enlightenment. They place a full estimate on the value of money, but are, nevertheless, scrupulously honest and conscientiously upright; generally manifesting a high degree of integrity in their business re lations. The present occupants of the Welsh Hills, de cendants of the pioneer settlers, have become considerably Americanized, readily adapting them selves to American institutions, language, customs, habits and modes of thought. They are distin guished for all the qualities of good citizenship, and justly claim a good degree of exemption from debasing habits, indulgence in groveling propensi ties, drunkenness, and the debauchery, vice and crime which degrade humanity.

OF ' ' Breathes there a man with soul so dead, Who never to himself hath said, This is my own, my native land!\" THE extreme width of Licking county is twenty- two and a half miles, from north to south, thirty miles from east to west. These dimensions would give the county six hundred and seventy-five square miles of territory; but as the original surveyors of 1796 failed to give a straight line on the northern boundary, a strip of sixteen miles in length, and about three-fourths of a mile in breadth, was lost, which reduces the figures to six hundred and sixty three miles. A tract of nearly two miles by two and a half in extent is also lost at the southeast corner of the county, which still further reduces the territory almost five square miles, leaving a sum total of only six hundred and fifty-eight square miles. The eastern half of the county is gener ally characterized as hilly, and only moderately"], [256, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 248 productive, yet nearly all cultivable; while the western half is level or rather undulating, and with a very small proportion too uneven or steep for the plow. It is beautifully diversified by hill and dale \u2014by high, irregular ridges and level plains \u2014 by sterile hills and fertile, alluvial bottoms\u2014 by the rough \"hill country\" of the eastern half of the county, and by the level and undulating lands of the western half. The eastern half is varied here and there by beautiful landscapes, high peaks, dark glens, inaccessible bluffs, cavernous dells, abrupt acclivities, rugged hillsides, craggy cliffs, such as are found on the \"Flint Ridge,\" at the \"Licking Narrows,\" along the Rocky fork, and in some other localities. Nine-tenths or more of the county is situated within the old United States Military District, and is, therefore, to that extent composed of United States Military lands \u2014 that is, lands set apart by Congress in June, 1796, for the payment of certain claims of the officers and soldiers for services rendered during the Revolutionary war. The nar row strip of two and a half miles wide, along the southern border of the county belongs to the Re fugee tract \u2014 a tract of land dedicated by Congress in April, 1798, to the payment of the claims of those refugees whose possessions in Canada and Nova Scotia hcd been confiscated by the British government, upon the alleged ground that their owners had abandoned them, and had joined the colonists in their struggle for independence. The United States Military lands amounted to two million six hundred and fifty thousand acres. The tract was bounded on the east by the west line of the seven ranges ; on the south by Congress lands and by the Refugee tract ; on the west by the Scioto river, and on the north by the Greenville treaty boundary line. The Refugee tract was four and a half miles wide, and forty-eight miles long, extending eastward from the Scioto river, and contained one hundred thou sand acres. The villages of Gratiot, Linnville, Amsterdam, Jacksontown, Hebron, Brownsville, Luray and Kirkersville are near to or upon the north line of the Refugee tract. Etna and Bow ling Green townships are wholly within it ; and the southern portions of Harrison, Union and Licking townships are also in the Refugee tract. The territory which now constitutes Licking coun ty, was within the limits of Washington county (the first county organized in the Northwest Territory), from 1788 until 1798, when, by the organization of Ross county, it became a portion of it, and so re mained until the year 1800, when Fairfield county being established, it was thrown into it and contin ued to be a portion of said county until 1808, when the organization of Licking county was effected. The first Territorial legislature of the Northwest Territory met at Cincinnati, September 16, 1799; and Ross county's representatives in that body were Edward Tiffin, Thomas Worthington, Samuel Findlay, and Elias' Langham ; and their only con stituents living within the present limits of Licking county, were the families of Elias Hughes, and John Ratliff, consisting of twenty-two persons. The second session, with the same representatives, was held at Chillicothe, in November, 1800. The third session, with the same representatives, ex cept Samuel Findlay, met at Chillicothe, November 23, 1801. The Territorial delegates in Congress were Gen eral William H. Harrison, who served from 1799 until 1800. William McMillen succeeded him, but served only until 1801, when Paul Fearing took his seat as such and served until 1803. In November, 1802, a constitutional convention was held at Chillicothe, and formed the first con stitution- for the State of Ohio. At that time we were part and parcel of Fairfield county, and that county was represented in said convention by Henry Abrams and Emanuel Carpenter. The first permanent white settlement made with in the present limits of the county was effected in 1798, by Elias Hughes and John Ratliff. They came to the Bowling Green (now in Madison township), on the Licking, from western Virginia and were the only settlers until early in the year 1800. The two families spent the preceding year at the mouth of the Licking, and in the spring of 1798 they ascended said stream some twenty miles, and there squatted, both families numbering, upon their arrival, twenty-one persons; During the year 1799 a son was born to Elias Hughes, thus increas ing the colony to twenty-two. The first death was"], [257, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 249 that of an infant child of John Stadden, whose birth and death occurred in the latter part of the year 1801. The first marriage within the limits of Licking county, was that of the parents of the aforesaid child \u2014 John Stadden and Elizabeth Green \u2014 which took place on Christmas day in the year 1800. John Ratliff died on the south side of the Licking, near the mouth of the Brushy fork, about or in the year 181 1. A few of the descend ants of Hughes and Ratliff still reside in the county. In the year 1800, Benjamin Green and Richard Pitzer settled on the Shawnee run, two miles below the junction of the North and South forks, having come from Alleghany county, Maryland. In the same year Captain Samuel Elliott, from the same county, settled half a mile above them. And in the same year Isaac Stadden, an emigrant from Northumberland county, Pennsylvania, settled half a mile above Captain Elliott. His brother John, an unmarried brother, accompanied him. He re mained unmarried, however, only until the Christ mas of this year. And it was during this year also that John Van Buskirk left Brooke county, Virginia, and settled upon a thirty-one hundred acre tract of land he had purchased, situated in the valley of the South fork (now in Union town ship), some eight miles or more above the mouth of the South fork. His death occurred December 31, 1840. Isaac Stadden was the first civil officer elected within the limits of the county. At an election held in January, 1802, at the cabin of Captain Hughes, he was chosen a justice of the peace of Licking township, then Fairfield county, and Elias Hughes, was elected captain of militia, at the same time and place. John Stadden became the first sheriff of Licking county, in 1808, and served as such, and as collector of taxes until 18 10. Cap tain Elliott was elected coroner of the county in 1808 and served as such for a score of years or more. He had been a soldier in the Revolution ary war. His death took place in May, 1831, in his eightieth year. Benjamin Green lived until 1835, dying at the age of seventy-six years. The year 1 801 \u2022 brought with it quite a number of settlers. John Larabee ascended the Licking river in a canoe to the mouth of the Bowling Green run, where he landed, and near that point on the south side of the Licking, he occupied a hol low sycamore tree, while he cleared some land, and raised a few acres of corn. He served throughout the whole Revolutionary war, and probably also in the Indian wars afterwards. Mr. Larabee died February 6, 1 846, aged four score and six years. James Maxwell came up the Licking with Mr. Larabee, John Weedman and a Mr. Carpenter. Maxwell was the first school teacher, and made that his life-long profession. He was also the first constable, having been elected to said office, January 1, 1802, at the same time and place of the election of Captain Hughes and Isaac Stad den, esq., Samuel Parr this year settled on the Licking bottoms, just below the junction of the North and South forks. James Macauley and James Danner located themselves near the mouth of Ramp creek, where the first named built a \"tub mill,\" or \"corn-cracker,\" the first water power con-' cern within the present limits of the county. Phil lip Barrick settled near the \"Licking Narrows.\" John Jones built his cabin in the Raccoon valley, five miles from the mouth of Raccoon creek, and Phineas and Frederick Ford and Benoni Benjamin theirs in the Ramp or Auter Creek valley, some miles from the mouth of Ramp or Auter creek. Phillip Sutton, Job Rathbone, and John and George Gillespie settled in the Hog Run valley. In September of this year, John Edwards came to the South Fork valley, from Brooke county, Virginia. He was distinguished as a hunter and an expert with the rifle, having been engaged as a spy for some years on the frontiers of Virginia, as well as the Northwest Territory. In coming he blazed the trees and killed the game for their subsistence, while others cut out. the road, where necessary, and still others followed with the wagon, which con tained his family and household effects. The year 1802 brought many immigrants. Alex ander Holmes and James Hendricks came from Brooke county, Virginia, and settled in the South Fork valley near the residence of their brother-in law, John Van Buskirk. Theophilus Rees, David Lewis, David Thomas, James Johnson, and Simon James came this year, most of them settling on the Welsh Hills. Jacob Nelson settled in the Licking valley, and not long thereafter built a mill, a mile or more below the junction of the North and South"], [258, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 25\u00b0 forks. Newark was laid out this year by General W. C. Schenck; and Abraham Miller, John War den and Henry Claybaugh came from the South branch of the Potomac, and settled in its imme diate vicinity. Michael Thorn, Frederick Myer, and Henry Ness located at or near the Little Bowl ing Green, on the southern borders of the county, during this year. They were from the Mononga hela country, in West Virginia. Adam Hatfield, James Black, Richard Parr, Samuel Elliott, Henry Claybaugh, Samuel Parr, and Samuel Elliott, jr., built and occupied cabins in Newark this year, except the younger Elliott, who probably had a tenant in his. The senior Elliott built the first hewed log house with shingled roof. Black kept a tavern on the lot now occupied by the Park House. Beall Babbs, James Jeffries and Mrs. Catharine Pegg, settled in or near Newark during \u2022this year. Jonathan Benjamin, father-in-law of John Jones and the Ford brothers, located on Ramp or Auter creek, in the spring of 1802. He had passed through the French and Indian wars, and through the Revolutionary war, also, and had been a frontiersman from his youth up. Mr. Ben jamin died in 1 841, at the great age of one hun dred and three years. Patrick Cunningham, Abra ham Johnson, Abraham Wright, James Petticord, Edward Nash, Carlton, Benedict, Aquilla, and two John Belts settled about and in New*ark, except Cunningham, who first lived neighbor to John Jones, having built the second cabin within the present limits of Granville township. He was from Tyrone county, province of Ulster, Ireland; the others were from Washington county, Pennsyl vania. A considerable colony from Brooke coun ty, Virginia, also settled in the South Fork valley. Peter Cramer settled on the Welsh Hills; Evan Humphrey and Chiswold May settled near the Big Spring in Newton township. These were all Virginians. Daniel Thompson, his son-in-law, Daniel Enyart, and Matthias and Hathaway Den man also came this year and settled in Hanover township; and Moses Meeks, William Harris, Charles Howard and John and Adam Myers set tled in Bowling Green township; Maurice Newman settled in Newark; John and Jacob Myers, Daniel Smith and James Taylor settled in Union town ship; John Channel, Thomas Deweese and Henry Smith settled in Madison township. Mr. Smith had officiated for some time as Territorial magis trate, under a commission from Governor St. Clair. He became one of the early time magistrates of Madison and associate judge in the county. In 1805, Rev. Joseph Thrap settled in the east ern borders ofthe county; George Ernst and John Feasel came from Shenandoah county, Virginia, and settled in Clay Lick valley; Elias and John Farmer came from Bedford county, Pennsylvania, and settled a few miles southwest of Newark; John and Jacob Switzer came to the Clay Lick from \"the glades\" of Pennsylvania; John Siglar settled in Hog Run valley; John Price, W. H. Mead and perhaps David Beaver located in the South Fork valley, as did David Herron and David Hatfield, in Newark; General John Spencer settled on Spen cer run, in Newton township; Archibald Wilson, jr., settled in Newark. The most valuable addi tion to the inhabitants of this year was the Gran ville colony, an account of which appears else where. Several emigrants also came to the Welsh Hills during this and the succeeding year, among whom were John Price, Benjamin Jones, John H. Phillips and Thomas Powell. In 1803, John Evans settled in the North Fork valley, seven miles north of Newark, and in the spring of the same year Evan Payne and Jacob Wilson located in the same valley about a mile above the mouth of the North fork. They, as well Evans, were Virginians. John Simpson, Robert Church, William Schamahorn, Richard Jewell, Ed ward Crouch, William and John Moore, Thomas Seymour, and William O'Bannon settled within the present limits of Madison township, during this year also. In 1806, the upper valley of Raccoon creek, now Monroe township, was settled by George W. Evans, and soon thereafter by Charles and George Green. Henry Drake also located in the upper valley of the South fork, now Harrison township, during this year. Chester and Elisha Wells and John Hollister settled near the mouth of the Rocky fork. Samuel Hand, James Holmes, and David Benjamin settled in the South Fork valley. Evan Pugh and Archibald Wilson settled north of Newark, in North Fork valley. The upper valley of In 1804, Thorrjas Cramer, Simon James and"], [259, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 25i the North fork, now Burlington township, was set tled by James Dunlap, Nathan Conard and others. William Hull and Isaac Farmer located this year in the vicinity of the Flint ridge. the Hog Run settlement, and before his year closed he there organized a society, or church, and that was the original, or pioneer church organiza tion in the county. He, probably, sometimess preached in Newark also; certainly his successor on the circuit, Revs. James Quinn and John Meeks, did, and also formed a small church organization as early as 1805, which was the second in our county. The Congregational church of Granville, organized before the Granville colony left New England, was the third religious society of* Licking county, and the Methodist society, organized in 1806, or a little later, near the Bow ling Green, was, probably, the fourth. A Metho dist society, near the eastern borders of this county, organized about the same time, and often ministered to by the Rev. Joseph Thrap, was most likely the next in order and the fifth in number. The Welsh Hills Baptist church was organized September 4, 1808, and was the sixth and next in order. In the autumn of the same year the First Presbyterian church of Newark was organized, and was the seventh in order, in the county, although there may have been a Methodist church organized earlier in the South Fork valley. In 1807 John Cook Herron built and occupied a cabin in the Raccoon valley, now St. * Albans township. Granville township, Fairfield county, was organized this year. It embraced the western half of the present county of Licking, except the Refugee lands, Licking township, embracing the eastern half, with the same exception. In 1808, Joseph Conard settled in the North Fork valley, near the present village of Utica. He came from Loudoun county, Virginia, and was the first settler within the present township of Wash ington. In this year (1808), the county of Lick ing was organized. In 1809, Henry lies settled within the present limits of Bennington township. In 1810, the Wakatomika valley was first settled by Samuel Hickerson, followed next year by James Thrap. Daniel Poppleton rendered a similar service within the present limits of Hartford township, in the year 181 2. Joseph and Peter Headly started a settlement on the head-waters of the South fork (now in Jersey township), in 1815. Etna town ship, too, was settled in 1815, if not a little earlier, by John Williams, the Housers and others. Isaac Essex settled there in 181 6. In the year 18 18 David Bright located in the northeastern part of this county, and was the first settler of Fallsbury township, while in 182 1, Rena Knight .built a cabin and opened a clearing near the head of Brushy fork, at a point now in Liberty township- Thus one locality after another became settled, and finally fully occupied in every section of the county. The Revs. Joseph Williams and James Axley were itinerating Methodist ministers in 1805. Rev. Peter Cartwright preached to the Methodist societies in 1806, as did also Rev. John Emmett. Rev. James Scott, a Presbyterian minister, also preached in Newark during this year. Rev. James Hoge, of the same denomination, visited and preached to .the people of Granville during the year, as did also Rev. Samuel P. Robbins, of the Congregational church, and Rev. David Jones, of the Baptist church. In 1807, Revs. Joseph Hayes and James King were the itinerant ministers who ministered regularly to the Methodist churches hereabouts. Sometimes, too, Revs. Jesse Stone man and Robert Manly ministered to them, as did also Rev. Levi Shinn. In 1808 the Revs. Ralph Lotspeitch and Isaac Quinn were the regular Methodist preachers. Elder James Sutton and Mr. Steadman appeared as Baptist ministers. Rev. Timothy Harris, a Congregational minister, took charge of the church in Granville this year and continued his ministration until 1S22. His ordination there was conducted by Revs. Lyman In 1802, a Presbyterian minister, named Mc- Donald, came along and preached two sermons to the settlers in the Licking valley. In 1803, Rev. John Wright, also a Presbyterian preacher, de livered two sermons in Newark. Thomas Marquis, another Presbyterian minister, gave the people of Raccoon valley a sermon or two during this year. During the autumn of this year, Rev. Asa Shinn, of the Methodist church, commenced preaching, as an itinerant minister, at Benjamin Green's, in"], [260, "252 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. Potter, Stephen Lindley, Jacob Lindley, John AVright and James Scott. In 1809 Revs. Ben jamin Lakin, and John Johnson were the Metho dist itinerants. Revs. Thomas Powell and John W. Patterson (Baptists), commenced their min isterial services in Licking county. In 1S10 the latter took charge of the WTelsh Hills church, and in the next year of the Hog Run church, also. Rev. James B. Finley was the Methodist itinerant of the year 18 10. The following table exhibits the number, location and denomination of the churches at present in I the county, the number of Christian societies, re j presented by one or more church buildings, being twenty-seven, twelve of them having each only one edifice, the others being divided among the re- maining fifteen denominations, forty being the highest number owned by any one, that being the Episcopal Methodist: The total valuation of church edifices in the county is three hundred thousand dollars, and they are supposed to furnish sittings for more than twenty thousand persons. The Methodists were the first denomination to organize, being in 1804; the Congregationalists were the second, being in 1805; the Baptists and Presbyterians the next, being in 1808; the Cove- nanters organized in i8t3; the Lutherans in 1817.

There are at present about one hundred miles of railroad in the county, as follows: Straitsville division of the Baltimore and Ohio road, ten miles; Central Ohio division of Baltimore and Ohio road, thirty-two miles; Northern division of same, thirteen miles; Pittsburgh, Cincinnati & St. Louis, twelve miles ; and the Ohio Central road (the new road not yet completed, passing through Granville), about thirty miles. A most extraordinary political excitement perva ded Licking county, as well as the country at large, during the year 1840 \u2014 the year of \"the log-cabin hard-cider-and-coon-skin campaign.\" As indicated, it was not a local but a general tornado raging with more or less fury, in all the States of the American Union, but in none of them was the hurricane wilder than in Ohio, and in no locality did it raeg more furiously than in \"Old Licking.\" The peo ple were wont to meet in immense crowds, and became intensely excited under the declamatory harangues of wranglers, demagogues and stump orators. The inflammatory appeals of the party press of the country, addressed to the passions, superadded to the fanatical and exciting speeches of the heated partisans, and candidates for public offices, roused the people as they had never been roused before, and worked them up to fever heat, producing a state of wild delirium among them, hitherto unparalleled in the history of the country and never afterwards approached in infuriated fanaticism. The stormy passions of the masses were lashed into uncontrollable fury; often dis played an intensity of feeling wholly unknown be fore, and manifested a degree of extravagance and wildness in the discussion of political questions that was a marvel to the few sober-minded men of both parties, that remained in a measure unaffected in the midst of the frenzy that had seized upon the multitudes. These abnormal manifestations char acterized one portion of the people, while the other portion, little, if any less excited or delirious, erected their lofty hickory poles, surmounted them with huge hickory brooms, and displayed the living rooster in various ways and in every conceivable manner, as the representative of antagonism to the coon, while their speeches about equaled in defam- ation of character the ribaldry of the doggerels sung by the former. And all this frantic madness resulted from the determination of the party of the first part, to prevent the re-election of Martin Van Buren and Richard M. Johnson, and substitute for them General William H. Harrison and John Tyler \u2014 this and nothing more. The question was, shall we elect General Harrison or Martin Van Buren President? Licking county decided by about two hundred majority in favor of the latter. The great gathering of the during the year was in Newark, on the fourth of July, Thomas Corwin being the Whig orator of the occasion, and John Brough the Democratic. Sam. White and Joshua Mathiot were the chief local orators of the former, and B. B. Taylor and James Parker of the latter. The delirium manifested itself in the oft-repeated gathering together by the populace, in immense meetings, at distances so remote as to necessitate an absence of a number of days, to the partial neglect of their usual avocations. The further ir rational manifestations of the excited crowds while going to and returning from those monster meetings, as well as while present at them, con sisted of singing songs and rolling balls \u2014 of rid ing from place to place in canoes on wheels, and of hauling with oxen or horses, from town to town, miniature log cabins, erected upon wheels partially covered with coon-skins (the ridge-pole of the roof being generally embellished with one or more live coons), and to whose corners were clinging, by way of adornment, full grown states men, nibbling at corn-dodgers or sections of john ny-cake and sipping at a gourd of hard cider, and at intervals singing, on the highest attainable key, doggerel songs in the interest of \"Tippecanoe and Tyler too.\" A few of the trades and industries and arts were also represented in miniature, on wheels, at the great conventions, and temporarily operated, sometimes while in motion. Some large log cabins, built of heavy logs, and furnished with buckeye chairs, were built in which to hold neigh borhood meetings, and in front of which the trunk of the largest accessible buckeye tree was erected, surmounted with a cider-barrel and a gourd at tached. One of these log cabins, with the usual adjuncts, was erected in Newark and used for"], [262, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 254 many months for the practice of the oratory, the eloquence, the minstrelsy peculiar to that year. The Whig victory of 1840 was, in the opinion of its leaders, a crushing blow to the Democracy. So badly was the party defeated that it was doubtful if it ever again could rally, \"unless with a change of name or a change of principles.\" During the ad ministration under Van Buren, the country was plunged into one of its financial crises \u2014 its curren cy ten, fifteen, and sometimes twenty-five per cent. below par, and the laboring man had his wages cut down almost to a starving point. In May, 1837, less than three months after the administration commenced, every bank in the United States, with few exceptions, suspended specie payments, and refused to redeem its wild-cat issues of notes. Had the President been firm the banks would not have had the vantage ground. But the treasure of the people was locked up in bank vaults \u2014 the govern ment had nothing with which to pay its debts or its current expenses, and President Van Buren called Congress together in extraordinary session. Then the banks were masters of the situation, and the President had a stormy four years of office. General Harrison, who four years before had but seventy-three electoral votes for President, against one hundred and seventy-six for Van Buren, at the election of 1840 had two hundred and thirty-four electoral votes to sixty for Van Buren. The popular vote for Harrison and Tyler showed almost as overwheming a majority as that of the Electoral colleges. The leading and more think ing men of the party who achieved this unprece dented triumph were afraid they had an elephant on their hands that they could not manage. But the men who voted to make times better, who were promised \"two dollars a day and roast beef\" if Harrison was elected, and but \"six and one- fourth cents a day and a sheep's pluck\" under Van Buren, were jubilant. They demanded a universal rejoicing \u2014 a day of jubilee for the salvation of the country. In many places they did rejoice with bonfires, illuminations, the firing of cannon, and with other demonstrations of joy. In Newark the rejoicing was to be one that would astonish the natives, and it did astonish them \u2014 to be an illu- mination of the whole country, as far as the town could be seen, by a unique bonfire, and it was a unique one. Around the public square, in the center of the town, on each of the four streets, they planted innumerable barrels of tar, digging holes so as to cover one-third or one-half of the barrel. The heads were knocked in, and shavings and pieces of dry wood, all well smeared with tar, were placed on top. The whole county was ad- vised of the grand event to come off on a particu- lar night, which, after consulting the almanac, they found would be a dark one, without any moon. From all the country round \u2014 in wagons and bug- gies, on foot and on horseback \u2014 came the de- lighted Whigs, brimful of joy and expected satis- faction. The night was an excellent one to show off a bright light, for the almanac was correct \u2014 there was no moon. The fire was applied to the shavings, and soon a bright blaze of fire was around the square; the jubilant Whigs cheered, and all seemed happy. But their joy was transient. As soon as the shavings and light wood burned down to the tar the light was absorbed by a suffocating smoke, and the square and the whole town were enveloped in it. Efforts were made to rekindle the tar by the addition of more fuel, but as the pine wood and shavings burned out the smoke be- came greater than ever. The Whigs were crest- fallen; the Democrats who ventured out were elated. As if by a sudden impulse, every sup- porter of Van Buren that owned or could borrow a lantern of any kind put a lighted tallow candle in and went out to see what they called the \"gloomination.\" The fires had to be extinguished, and for days the smell of tar was in and around the town of Newark. The Whigs were the worst- bored men ever seen in that region. The mere mention of the grand illumination acted as quickly as the sight of a red shawl does on a mad bull, exciting them to rage. But in the end the tables were turned, the biters were bitten. The death of General Harrison, after being president one month, devolved the executive office on Vice-President Tyler. He was made the scape- goat for the violated promises of good times which came not. Ohio in 1840 elected Thomas Corwin over 1 Shannon for governor, by a clear majority of over I sixteen thousand votes, an immense majority in"], [263, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 255 that day when the vote of Ohio was much less than half that which is now annually given. In 1842 the same candidates for governor were again in the field, and Shannon beat Corwin by a plurality of nearly two thousand, and the Dem ocracy from, what Governor Wood called, \"be nighted Ashtabula to intelligent Hamilton county,\" were uproariously happy. During the contest they worked to \"right the wrongs of 1840 in 1842,\" and to their great surprise they were successful. Remembering the faux pas of the Whigs two years before, in their celebration at Newark, when their illumination was but a \"gloomination,\" the Lick ing county Democracy declared their intention of showing the silly Whigs how to do the thing right. In the same public square the Democratic leaders had collected a large quantity of dry elm logs, from ten to fifteen feet long. These they had split in long strips. Procuring the longest pole they could get, they fastened a couple of slips of light timber at a distance from the bottom suffi cient to allow the pyramid of elm sticks to reach it. Above they had empty tar barrels around the pole, the lower end resting on the intended pyramid. The barrels, as they were put on the pole, were filled with shavings, straw, etc., all well saturated with tar and turpentine \u2014 and then the pole, thus decorated, was, with much difficulty, raised to a perpendicular and the end firmly secured in the ground. The pyramid of dry elm was then made by placing the upper end of the sticks against the cross-pieces at the foot of the barrels, with barrels, shavings, and other combustibles placed in its center and between the sticks, so as easily to be fired. At the appointed hour, in the sight of thousands collected to see it, the mass was fired. Kike the evening of the Whig celebration, the night was a fine one. Not a breath of air was to be felt. In a few moments the fire found its way through the barrels, which acted as a chimney, and the flame shot upward, as a pillar of fire by night, until it almost seemed to reach the heavens. But the best laid plans \"o' mice and men gang aft aglee.\" Just as it reached the highest point a breeze struck it, and the column of fire seemed gently to bend, until it finally wrapped the cupola of the court house, then one of the most costly in the State. A panic swayed the crowd; for a moment men stood aghast, and a rush was made. The pyramid was torn down, and the pole with the barrels on it was promptly razed. The court house was saved, and with it, perhaps, other buildings, and that ended the Democratic illumination by bon-fire. If the Whigs, two years before, were chagrined at their failure to illuminate, the Democrats were doubly so in 1842 at their success. The one al most smothered the town in tar-smoke; the other came near burning down the town to make a light. Terms were finally made between the parties. Each was to ignore in speech any mention of the ill-success of the other. This manner of conducting a presidential cam paign continued many years after 1840, though, perhaps, few were characterized with such intense excitement, bitterness of feeling and universal inter est. Even yet the people are much given to bonfires and processions, cannon, music, pole-rais ing, etc., in the conduct of political campaigns; but it would seem as if they were growing less conservative in this respect, and more and more inclined to listen to speech-making, and to indulge in the quiet reading of newspapers, and the form ing of their opinions in less demonstrative and a more sober and sensible manner. The campaigns are being conducted more and more on the principle of appeal to the judgment and higher intellectual faculties, rather than the passions and prejudices. The advance in mail facilities, and the increase in post offices from time to time, well illustrates the growth of the county. During the first five years after the first settlement of the county, Zanesville was the nearest post office. Newark was then made a post town, and some years thereafter a post office was established in Granville. A post office was established in Utica about the year 181 5. A weekly mail, carried on horseback, supplied these offices. A post office was established in Hanover at Chester Wells, and another between Newark and Utica, called Newton Mills. These were the princi pal offices before 1825, except those at Johnstown, Vandorn's, and Homer, numbering eight in all, which were chiefly supplied by the two mail routes, one crossing the county east and west, the other"], [264, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 256 north and south, run by two-horse, and sometimes four-horse stages, twice a week. After 1828 came the ponderous, fast-going four-horse coach, running daily at about seven miles per hour. Afterwards came the packets, and the pony express \u2014 now the principal mails are carried daily or several times a day, in railroad cars moving at the rate of thirty miles an hour. The post offices now number thirty five in all, there being one or more in almost every township of the county, so that probably not a man in Licking county lives more than five miles from a post office. The prominent men of the county are thus men tioned by Hon. Isaac Smucker in his Centennial history; he forgets, in his modesty, to place his own honored name in the list: \" It may not be amiss to give the names of some of those who commenced their career here during the first half and finished it during the last half of the century. Conspicuous among this class were Captain Bradley Buckingham, David Moore, Isaac Stadden, Colonel Robert Davidson, Rees Darlington, Benjamin Briggs, Major John Stewart, Colonel W. W. Gault, John Cun ningham, esq., Stephen McDougal, Sereno Wright, Major Elisha Warren, Judge Bancroft, William Hull, John Van Bus kirk, Captain Samuel Elliott, William Gavitt, Captain Willarcl Warnlr, James Gillespie, James Holmes, Colonel William Spencer, Richard Lamson, Peter Schmucker, Amos H. Caffee and many others. \"To give a measure of completeness to this Centennial his tory of Licking county, I beg leave also to bring to notice some of the gentlemen who have most conspicuously identified them selves with our county during the latter half only of the Centen nial period now closing. Prominent among the list given under this head are Jonathan Taylor, Joshua Mathiot and Daniej Duncan, who were all elected to Congress, as well as to other positions of honor and responsibility. Another trio of this class consisted of Israel Dille, Dr. J. N. Wilson and Lucius Case, all men of intelligence, extensive information and talents, who were largely influential in giving direction to public senti ment. They were original thinkers, zealous investigators, en thusiastic students. The two first named pushed their investiga tions in the direction of philosophy and the natural sciences, with diligence and a good degree of success. The tastes of the latter led him to the study of jurisprudence and political economy; hence he became prominent as a lawyer, and as an active and influential debater in the Constitutional convention of 1851-52. Conspicuous also among our latter-half-century. men was he who was familiarly called Sam. White. He was an influential legislator for a time, and moreover attained to the highest reputation among us as a popular orator, and an un faltering friend of freedom! Colonel B. B. Taylor, too, for a brief time as senator and political orator, filled a large space in the public eye. James Parker and James R. Stanberry also obtained distinction as public speakers, not only at the bar and before political assemblies, but also as grave and dignified senators. Among others of our modern legislators were Samuel D. King, George H. Flood, P. N. O'Bannon, Daniel Duncan, W. B. Woods, Charles Follett, Willard Warner, Dr, Walter B. Morris, R. B. Truman, George B. Smythe, John F. Follett, C. B. Giffin, William Parr, William Bell, J. B. Jones, J. W. Owens, W. D.

C. McElroy, of Zanesville, a strong, vigorous and original thinker, and an extensive contributor to the best medical jour nals of Europe and America; and Dr. T. B.

They then gave notice to all concerned throughout Ohio and the adjoining States, that a commencement of the excavation would be made on the fourth of July, 1825. Samuel Forrer, of Dayton, was appointed princi pal acting engineer; John Forrer, local engineer on the Summit, and he immediately prepared a few rods of ground, where the line of the canal would pass through a field, for the public demonstration. The invited guests included many of the not ables of the State and nation, among whom were Governor De Witt Clinton, of New York; Messrs. Rathburn and Lord; General Edward King, of Chillicothe; General Sanderson, of Lancaster; Governor Morrow, of this State; Ex-Governor Worthington ; Hon. Thomas Ewing, who was the orator of the day, and many others. Governor Clinton was expected to throw out the first spade ful of earth. This gentleman had proven himself the great friend of internal improvements, having been the principal promoter in the building of the Erie canal in his own State. A correspondence between leading friends of the enterprise resulted in the appointment of a committee to carry out the wishes of the commis sioners. This committee consisted of Judge Wil son and Alexander Holmes, of Licking, and Judge Elnathan Schofield, one of the earliest surveyors in this section, and John Noble, of Fairfield county. This committee, at their first meeting, engaged Gottleib Steinman, a hotel keeper of Lancaster, to furnish a dinner, upon the ground, for the invited guests; and as many more as would \"We make of Nature's giant powers The slaves of human Art.\" \u2014 Whittier. A LARGE majority of the people of Ohio know but little at present about the great Ohio canal, and the interest taken in it at the commencement of the work. It was considered one of the greatest undertakings of the age, and indeed, was the begin ning of that grand series of internal improvements which has greatly assisted in placing Ohio among the foremost States of the Union. The following history of this great work is taken mostly from the writings of Colonel John Noble, one of the con tractors in the work, and from those of William Wing, esq., deceased. Mr. Wing was also a con tractor on the canal, and died in Columbus, Ohio, February 13, 1878, in his seventy-ninth year. . He was an honorary member of the Licking County Pioneer society, and contributed liberally to its historical records. He was well versed in the pioneer history of Central Ohio, and has left be hind him writings of much historical value. As the canal had its beginning in licking county, it is eminently proper that its history should appear in this work. Before the building of the canal this county had no outlet for produce, except by wagons to the lake, or by wagons to the Muskingum river, and thence by boat to New Orleans. The country was full of produce for which there was no market. Ham was worth three cents per pound; eggs, four cents per dozen; flour, one dollar per hundred; whiskey, twelve and a half cents per gallon, and other things proportionately cheap. The commissioners appointed by the legislature to carry on the work appointed Judge D. S. Bates, \u2014Whittier."], [266, "258 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. pay for a dinner ticket, at one dollar and fifty cents a ticket. This proved to be a losing business for Steinman. It happened to be wet two or three days before the Fourth, and as there were no houses near the site of the entertainment, rough booths were constructed in the woods; tables and seats were made of plank, hauled from saw-mills at a considerable distance from the place. All the fancy part of the dinner, including pastry, etc., were prepared at Lancaster, twenty-two miles south. The entire preparation was made under the most unfavorable circumstances. The roasts and broils were prepared on the ground. The Fourth opened fine and clear; the dinner was good, and enjoyed by all that partook; but of the thousands who at. tended, many, prepared for the emergency by bringing a hamper, of provisions with them. The ceremonies began according to programme. Governor Clinton received the spade, thrust it into the soil, and raised the first spadeful of earth, amid the most enthusiastic cheers of the assembled thousands. This earth was placed in what they called a canal wheelbarrow, and the spade was passed to Governor Morrow, a statesman and a farmer. He sank it to its full depth, and raised the second spadeful. Then commenced a strife as to who should raise the next. Captain Ned. King, com manding the infantry company present from Chilli cothe, raised the third; then some of the guests of Governor Clinton's company threw in some dirt, and the wheelbarrow being full, Captain King wheeled it to the bank. It is impossible to de scribe the scene of excitement and confusion that accompanied this ceremony. The people shouted themselves hoarse. The feeling was so great that tears fell from many eyes. The stand for the speaking was in the woods. The crowd was so great that one company of cavalry was formed in a hollow square, around the back and sides of the stand. The flies, after three days' rain, were so troublesome, that the horses kept up a constant stamping, much to the annoy ance of the crowd. Caleb Atwater, the noted antiquarian, was present, and made the following remark afterward at Lancaster: \"I suppose it was all right to have the horses in front of the speaker's stand, for they cannot read, and we can.\" Governor Clinton and friends, Governor Mor row, Messrs. Rathburn and Lord, with many others were invited to Lancaster, where they were handsomely entertained by the citizens. Rathburn and Lord were the men who negotiated the loan of four hundred thousand dollars for Ohio; and the Lancaster bank was the first to make terms with the fund commissioners to receive and dis burse the money. The wages for work on the canal were eight dollars for twenty-six working days, or thirty and three-fourth cents per day, from sunrise to sunset. The hands were fed well and lodged in shanties, and received their regular \"jiggers\" of whiskey the first four months. Micajah T. Williams and Alfred Kelley were the acting commissioners, and proved themselves faith ful public servants. They were often passing up and down the line, and saw the evil effects of the \"jigger\" of whiskey. They left notice at each con tract station that they would not pay estimates monthly if the contractors furnished whiskey on the work \u2014 an order that caused much grumbling among a certain class of the men, but it was promptly obeyed by the contractors. A jigger was small, not a gill in measure, but fifty or sixty men taking four of these per day \u2014 at sunrise, at ten o'clock, at noon, at four o'clock, and before supper \u2014 would exhaust a barrel of whiskey in four or five days. Men from Fairfield, Hocking, Gallia and Meigs counties, and all the country around, came to work on the canal. Farmers and their sons wanted to earn this amount of wages, as it was cash \u2014 a very scarce article \u2014 and they must have it to pay taxes and other cash expenses. Before the canal was finished south of the Sum mit, the north end from Dresden to Cleveland was in operation; and wheat sold on the canal at seventy five cents per bushel. Corn rose in proportion, and the enemies of the canal, all of whom were large land holders, or large tax payers, began to open their eyes. One of these, a Mr. Shoemaker, of Pickaway county, below Tarlton, was a rich land owner, and had opposed the building of the canal, as it would increase his tax and then be a failure. This gentleman, for such he was, said that his boys, with one yoke of oxen and a farm cart, hauled po tatoes to Circleville and sold them for forty cents"], [267, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 259 per bushel until they had more money than suf ficed to pay all his taxes for a year. This was an article for which, before this, there was no market, and he was now a convert to improvement. Wheat raised from twenty-five cents to one dollar per bushel before the canal was finished. The contracts for building the canal were made soon after breaking the ground at Licking Summit. The first at Newark embraced all the section from the point of breaking ground, south, including the embankment of the Licking Summit reservoir to the deep cut, so called, and there was one section at the south end of the cut let, about this time, to Colonel Noble. At these lettings, statements were posted up for the information of bidders, of the quantity and different kinds of work in each sec tion, and also their estimates of the value of doing the same. Bidders from New York were present, and obtained some of the heaviest jobs \u2014 as the reservoir job and some others. The price of exca vation and embankment was from nine to thirteen cents per cubic yard; grubbing and clearing, per chain, two to ten dollars, according to circum stances. But little masonry was let in this division ; and the work here was let about ten per cent, below the engineer's estimates. Colonel Noble probably took his contract on the engineer's estimates, as it was deemed necessary that that section should be finished, in order to afford drainage when the deep cut should be put under contract. It is said that the colonel was at considerable expense in procuring ma- chinery to pull down the large elm trees, of which there were many on the section, and that the at- tempt to get them out in that way was not a success. His contract, therefore, did not prove a profitable one. The next letting at Newark included the deep cut, so called, and the South Fork feeder. The length of this cut was about three miles. At the deepest place it was about thirty-four feet, descend- ing gradually in either direction to about eight feet at either end, so that it would average about twen- ty-four feet the whole length. It was divided into two sections, and the whole was let at fifteen cents per cubic yard; the north half to Scoville, Hatha- way & Co., of New York, and the south half to Osborn, Rathburn & Co., of Columbus. The first named party sub-let their job to Hampson & Parkinson, of Muskingum county, who carried it on for a time and abandonded it at very consider able loss, it is said. The other party, under the firm name of Osborn, Willliams & Co., prosecuted their work to final completion, and undertook the unfinished part of the north section; but they ob tained, at different times, of the commissioners, an advance on the price originally agreed upon, so that at the close they were paid about thirty cents a yard for the work. Probably the average was twenty-five cents per yard cost to the State. It is somewant singular, that on the highest part of the cut there was a swamp of a few acres, where the water stood in the spring of the year, and as it was raised by heavy rains, the water flowed from the swamp north to the waters of the Licking, and south to the tributaries of the Scioto. The feeder above mentioned, being mostly common work, was let at low rates, probably below the estimates. The next work was also let at Newark. It com- ' menced at the north end of Licking Summit, thence northward to Nashport, including all the heavy work, and the dam at the lower end of the Licking Narrows. The letting embraced some twelve to fifteen locks, two aqueducts and cul verts, with the usual excavation and embankment. The masonry of the locks was bid in at from two dollars to two dollars and fifty cents per perch of sixteen and one-half cubic feet, which included a lock finished, except the excavation of the pit and embankment around the lock. The other mason ry was let at proportionate rates, and the other work went very low. There was great competition. The next letting was at Irville, in Muskingum county; commencing at the north end of the above described work, extending north to Roscoe, upon which there was considerable heavy work let at about the same rates as above, competition being no less. The next work was let at Lancaster, commenc- ing at the south end of Colonel Noble's job, thence southward to Circleville. This included some heavy work, also. There were some twenty or twenty-five locks, a few culverts and aqueducts, a dam at Bloomfield, and about the usual amount of earth work. All were let at low prices; the first six locks south of Licking Summit at three dollars"], [268, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 260 three hundred and six miles long, exclusive of the lateral canal to Columbus, eleven miles, and the Dresden side cut, together with slack-water naviga tion to Zanesville, seventeen miles more, making in all three hundred and thirty-four miles, includ ing its various windings. It commences at Cleve land and passes up the Cuyahoga river to the old portage, between it and the Tuscarawas river; by the city of Akron and over to the Tuscarawas, down whose valley it follows to Massillon, Dover, New Philadelphia, Newcomerstown, Caldersburgh, Coshocton and Dresden, where it leaves the Tus carawas, or rather the Muskingum as the river is called below Coshocton, and takes a southwesterly direction, passing Nashport, and striking the Lick ing river just beyond the eastern line of Licking county, passing up that river to Newark; thence up the South fork to Hebron, Deep Cut, Baltimore and Carrol, reaching the Scioto river just within the limits of Pickaway county, eleven miles south of Columbus. From this point it follows the Scioto valley to the Ohio river, passing the towns of Bloomfield, Circleville, Westfall, Chillicothe and Piketon to Portsmouth. It is owned and con trolled by the State, and is under the immediate supervision of the board of public works, who appoint all its officers and have entire charge of all its affairs. It is divided into three divisions, each of which is in charge of a chief engineer, who looks after repairs and other matters and makes a yearly report to the board. Collectors are stationed at various places along the canal, whose business is to collect tolls and water rent. A specified amout of toll is paid by those who run the boats, both upon the boat and cargo, the rate depending upon the value or quality of the cargo. It'varies from two or three mills to two or three cents per mile. The boats are owned by private individ uals, who have the use of the canal by paying the tolls. Before the days of railroads these boats did a through business, and some of them were \"passenger packets,\" which were lightly and neatly built, and arranged for carrying passengers, and made much quicker time than the freight boats. Since the advent of railroads, however, this class of boats has, of course, disappeared, and those carrying freight now do only a local business, the railroads doing all through business. The boats and fifteen cents a perch; the face stone were hauled from the neighborhood of Lancaster, an average distance of eight miles. Lower down, about Carrol, Lockport and Winchester, the locks were about two dollars and fifty cents a perch. The light locks, just above the junction of the main canal with the Columbus feeder, were let at three dollars and twenty-five cents a perch. At these prices it required the closest economy to do the work without loss. Some of the jobs awarded were abandoned and afterwards re-let at better prices. The price of labor was very low. Wages did not rise above ten dollars per month for four or five years. There was no \"eight hour system;\" the men worked all day. Very few Irish or other foreigners had arrived at that time, and the work was mostly done by native Americans. It was a great undertaking for the State to build the canal; and although its working has never paid the interest on its cost, yet, it has, without doubt, paid for itself many times over by the in creased wealth it brought to the State, and the great increase in values of every marketable thing, cover ing a large extent of country. The Granville feeder extended from Licking Summit to Raccoon creek, at Paige's woollen fac tory, about a mile and a quarter southeast of Gran ville. In order to have navigation as near Gran ville as possible, the commissioners agreed to make the feeder navigable for boats as far as Paige's fac tory, provided the people of Granville would make it navigable from thence to the bridge at the Lan caster road. This they agreed to do. It involved considerable expense, as a dam, guard-lock, lift lock and about a half mile of canal had to be built to render it navigable. A warehouse was erected at the head of navi gation, and a boat built there by the Troy and Ohio line, under the superintendence of a Mr_ Wallace. This is believed to have been the first canal boat built south of Cleveland. The feeder was used for navigation until the Granville furnace was abandoned in 1838, since which it has become dilapidated and out of re pair. The \"Grand Canal,\" as it was first called, passes entirely across the State, connecting the waters of Lake Erie with those of the Ohio river. It is"], [269, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 26l will carry from fifty to eighty tons, and draw from two to three feet of water. Their principal busi ness now is to transport coal, wheat, building stone and any freight that does not require quick trans portation. In 1 86 1 the canal was leased to a company for ten years, and at the end of that time the lease was renewed for ten years, but the company aban doned the lease in 1878, the State taking posses- sion again in May, 1879. For several years prior to leasing it the canal had been a heavy yearly expense to the State, the receipts falling much be low the expenditures; since taking possession again in 1879, however, the receipts have largely exceeded the expenditures, and the State, probably for the first time in the history of this enterprise, is now making money out of it. CHAPTER XXXII. RAILROADS. Sandusky, Mansfield, and Newark\u2014 Central Ohio\u2014 Baltimore and Ohio \u2014 Pan Handle\u2014 The Straitsville Road \u2014 Ohio Central. ' ' The mothers ran out with theii children about, From every log cabin they hail ; The wood-chopper he stood delighted to see The law-makers ride on a rail. The horses and cattle, as onward we rattle, Were never so frightened before.\" THERE are four railroads centering in the city of Newark, but as three of them are at present con trolled by one corporation (the Baltimore & Ohio) the number is practically reduced to two \u2014 the Balti more & Ohio and the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati & St. Louis; the latter better known as the \"Pan Handle.\" Three of these roads were completed to Newark between the years 1852 and 1855; half a century after the town was laid out. The Sandusky, Mansfield & Newark railroad was the first one completed to Newark. A por tion of this road was one of the first built in Ohio \u2014 the northern portion. It extended, when completed, from Sandusky City to Newark, a dis tance of one hundred and sixteen and one-half miles. This road (now a part of the Baltimore & Ohio) has had more charters, amendments, con solidations, reorganizations and adjustments than any in Ohio. It probably never paid expenses, unless it does so under its present management. Very few roads running due north and south, as does this one, have paid for the building. The great travel and carrying business of this country seems to be east and west, and generally only roads built in conformity with this law, put money in the pockets of the stockholders. The germ of this road sprang into life between Monroeville and Sandusky City, and was chartered March 9, 1835, under the name of the Monroeville & Sandusky City railway. At that early day im mense freight wagons were doing the carying trade for the country, and Lake Erie was the great outlet for grain and produce for the interior of Ohio. Pork, wheat, whiskey, furs, peltry, and everything else then produced in Ohio, were wagoned to the lake and shipped on vessels for Buffalo and points further east. Portland (San dusky City) became a great market, or at least, a very important point for Ohio people, and a few enterprising men thought by building a railroad from this point south, they could get this entire freight business from their southern terminal point. When their road was first built wooden rails were used, and the cars were small box concerns, on wooden wheels, and were hauled by horses from Monroeville to Sandusky. It was not long, how ever, until steam-power superceded horse-power, but for a long time the road bed was \"wooden,' that is, the cars run on wooden rails upon which was fastened a piece of strap iron. On the twelfth of March, 1836, a charter was 7"], [270, "262 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. obtained for a road from Mansfield to New Haven. The building of this road interfered some what with the business of the first road, and yet was of but little value without the co-operation of the first; hence a plan of consolidation was soon agreed upon, the gap between New Haven and Monroeville filled, and the road became one con tinuous line from Mansfield to Sandusky City, a distance of fifty-four miles. It was then called the Mansfield & Sandusky City railroad. The Columbus & Lake Erie road was chartered March 12, 1845. This was Newark's first railroad, and extended from Newark to Mansfield, a dis tance of sixty-two and one-half miles, connecting there with the Mansfield & Sandusky City road, thus opening up direct communication with the lake. Another corporation, the Huron & Oxford road, extended from Huron to the line of the Monroe ville & Sandusky City road, a distance of eight miles, and was chartered March 12, 1845. Each of these companies had stock subscrip tions and executed separate mortgages. Novem ber 23, 1853, the three companies consolidated under the name of the Sandusky, Mansfield & Newark railroad company. The woorjen road-bed is thus described: \"The construction of the road-bed was solid, if a multi plicity of timbers could make it so. First a mud-sill was laid down lengthwise of the road; strong cross-ties were then spiked on this mud-sill; into these 'gains ' werecut, and these received the wooden rails, sawed to fit them. These rails were about five inches wide at the top, broadening at the bottom where they entered the gains, and were about seven inches high. On these the 'ribbon' was spiked, being a strip of hard wood, about two and a half inches wide, by one inch thick, and on this the strap-iron rail was laid. . Spikes were driven through the strap-rail and the ribbon, into the large wooden rail beneath; the heads of the spikes being sunken into 'eyes' in the strap rails, leaving a smooth surface for the wheels. This super structure required fully three times as much timber as the pres ent system of ties and iron rails.\" About a year before the consolidation of the three roads forming the Sandusky, Mansfield & Newark road, the Columbus & Lake Erie road was finished to Newark. This was one of the greatest events in the history of this city; second only to the opening of the canal. The building of this road had been agitated nearly twenty years. As early as 1834-5, meet- ings were held by the citizens for the purpose of organization, and to obtain a survey of the route. It was a mighty undertaking, however; the coun try was yet sparsely settled and the people too poor to engage in such an enterprise, and it was not until ten years later that a charter was ob tained, and nearly another decade before the road was finally finished for the passage of trains over the entire line. Under the corporate name of Sandusky, Mans field & Newark railroad, it was operated but a short time, with little better financial result than under the separate corporations, notwithstanding a new and consolidated mortgage was made and bonds issued. Proceedings were soon commenced in the Erie Common Pleas court, to bring all the creditors into court and sell the road to extinguish the several liabilities. It was found that the value of the road and property would pay but a small portion of the liabilities of the several corpora tions, and a plan of capitalization and reorganiza tion was proposed and submitted to the stock holders and creditors, for an adjustment of the stock and a compromise of the liabilities of the company. A large number of stockholders and creditors of the several companies had not converted their securities into the consolidated company, and some that had were unwilling to accept the terms of readjustment, and on the eighth of April, 1856, the legislature passed an act to .aid in carrying out this adjustment, entitled \"an act for the relief of the stockholders and creditors of the Sandusky, Mansfield & Newark railroad company.\" Under this act and by virtue of a decree of the court in the case referred to, the road and property were sold and the company reorganized; and un der the act of April 4, 1863, the directors of the old consolidated company conveyed, by deed, the franchise, or right to be a corporation, to the re organized company. A large majority of the stockholders and credit ors accepted the terms of the new arrangement and surrendered the old securities. By the terms of adjustment a large amount of the old stock and debts was sunk, and the re mainder passed into new hands. Since the reor ganization, the Huron branch, as it was called,"], [271, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 263 being the old Huron and Oxford road, has been abandoned and the rails removed. Up to the time of the transfer to the Baltimore & Ohio road, this road had not, probably, been able to pay a dividend to its stockholders; and often was not able to pay its interest promptly, but managed to maintain the road and rolling stock in good condition. It had always been a favorite project with this company to extend their line by building a road south from Newark into the coal region of Perry county, but nothing was done in that direction, and February 13, 1869, a con tract was entered into by and between the Sandu sky, Mansfield & Newark, the Ohio Central and the Baltimore &: Ohio railroads, whereby the first named came under the control of the last named, and is now operated by that extensive corporation. The second railroad that favored Newark with its presence, was the Central Ohio. It was not much behind the Sandusky, Mansfield & New ark, having been finished to Newark in 1854. The charter for the building of this road was granted February 8, 1847; to run from Columbus, Ohio, through Newark and Zanesville to such a point on the Ohio river as the directors might select. The work was commenced in June, 1850, on that por tion between Columbus and Newark, and rapidly pushed forward. Those were hard times, how ever, for building railroads; money was hard to get, and the new road labored continually under financial embarrassment; and before it could be finished and equipped, it was overtaken by insol vency. In May, 1859, it was placed in the hands of a receiver, and in that condition operated until its final sale and reorganization or capitalization in 1865. By the terms of reorganization concessions were made by all classes of creditors and stock holders, by which nearly four millions of dollars of stock and debt were sunk. The road runs in an easterly direction from Columbus to the Ohio river at Bellaire, a distance of one hundred and thirty-seven miles, thirty-three miles (that part between Newark and Columbus), of which is partly owned by the \" Pan Handle\" road, that company having purchased an undivided half in 1863, for seven hundred and seventy-five thou sand dollars. 1 There are five tunnels on this road, east of Zanesville, with an aggregate length of one thou sand eight hundred and seventy feet. November 21, 1866, the company reorganized, entered into a contract for operating the road, fix tures and equipment, with the Baltimore & Ohio railroad company, for a term of twenty years, sub ject to termination in five years at the option of either party upon notice; the Baltimore & Ohio, among other things, agreeing to pay for the first five years as rent, quarter-yearly, the balance of gross earnings and receipts from the road after deducting sixty-five per centum thereof, and sixty per centum after five years, agreeing and guarantee ing that the amount to be paid shall not be less than one hundred and sixty-six thousand dollars for each year. This contract went into effect De cember 1, 1866. The Baltimore & Ohio road which yet operates this Central Ohio, and also the Sandusky, Mans field & Newark, has grown from insignificant proportions to one of the largest trunk lines in the country. This road was commenced in 1830, its object being to open a line of communication with the west, and the undertaking was looked upon at that day as one of almost unparalleled magnitude. The following items in the early history of this road would, doubtless, cause a ripple of humor in the minds of some of the railroad kings of to-day. In July, 1832, the following appears in print: \"Many passengers and large quantities of freight pass daily on the railroad to and from Baltimore, to the Point of Rocks on the Potomac, at which latter place a new village is being buiit very rapidly. The entire journey 'out and home', one hundred and forty miles, is now made in seventeen continuous hours, giving ample time to view the Point of Rocks, one of the most agreeable excursions that can be found in the country, and on many accounts highly interesting.\" Securing control of the Central Ohio in 1S66, and of the Sandusky, Mansfield & Newark in 1869, its way to Lake Erie was open. Not satis fied with these acquisitions, wishing an outlet to Chicago and the great Northwest, and not being able to get control of any road in that direction, it boldly advanced the capital, purchased the right of way, and built a road to Chicago, from a point in northern Ohio on its line nearest to that piace. This it accomplished in 1873, pushing a road through in a bee line from Chicago Junction, in Huron county, Ohio, to Chicago. This accom-"], [272, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 264 plished, and it had a through line to Chicago from Baltimore and Washington, and was in a position to compete with the other large trunk lines of the country. The business on the Central Ohio and the Sandusky, Mansfield & Newark has largely increased since these roads passed under control of the Baltimore & Ohio. A single track carries the trains of this road and the Pan Handle between Newark and Columbus. The Pittsburgh, Columbus & Cincinnati railroad constitutes the line from Columbus, Ohio, to Pitts burgh, Pennsylvania, and was the third road to pass through Newark, following closely, however, the other two. It is familiarly known as the \"Pan Handle route\" \u2014 so called from the narrow neck, or section, of West Virginia extending up and along the Ohio river, across which the Pitts burgh & Steubenville road (being a part of this line) passes. The road runs in an eastwardly di rection from Columbus to Pittsburgh, one hun dred and ninety-three miles, and is the shortest and most direct line between these two cities. That part of the road lying in Ohio is one hundred and fifty miles long, from Columbus to Steuben ville. The Steubenville & Indiana railroad company was chartered February 24, 1848, and under its charter and amendments thereto commenced work in November, 185 1, on the eastern division, opening the road for traffic from Steubenville to Newark, in April, 1855. This line, with a branch from the main line to Cadiz, eight miles in length, constituted the road of the Steubenville & Indiana railroad company. The delay in building the road from Steubenville to Pittsburgh, the want of proper connections east or west, and the unfin ished and poorly equipped condition of the road, gave insufficient earnings to pay interest and cur rent expenses; the company became greatly em barrassed and fell in arrears to laborers and for supplies, and was annoyed and perplexed with suits and judgments which it was unable to fund or pay, and, finally, proceedings were commenced in the court of common pleas, of Harrison county, Ohio, for the foreclosure of mortgages and sale of the road, and Thomas L. Jewett was appointed receiver on the second day of September, 1859. On the first of October, 1864, the receiver, on be- half of the company, purchased an undivided half of that part of the Central Ohio between Newark and Columbus, as before stated, for seven hun dred and seventy-five thousand dollars, thus giv ing the company an independent outlet and direct communication with railroads running west from Columbus. Meantime the work on the Steubenville & Pittsburgh road was rapidly pushed forward to completion, and on the first of October, 1865, the receiver concluded an arrangement with the lessees of that road for operating the whole line from Columbus to Pittsburgh. The road received the name of Pittsburgh, Cincinnati & St. Louis, and December 28, 1867, it was reorganized under the name of the Pan Handle. Upon completion it was leased to the Pennsylvania railroad company, by which it is now operated. The construction and equipment of this road cost, in round num bers, twenty million dollars. This corporation has just now (December, 1880) completed a beautiful brick depot building and a freight house at New ark. The freight house is of brick and stone, is very large, and both buildings are very substantial. What is known as the Straitsville railroad, was projected as early as 1854. It was intended to be operated in connection with the Sandusky, Mans field & Newark road, to tap the coal-fields of Perry county. Moore & Company were the contractors, and the construction of the road-bed was pushed forward to completion, or nearly so. Some of the bridges were built and timber for many others purchased, when the enterprise was overtaken with financial disaster and the work sus pended. It remained in this condition nearly twenty years. Those who thought of the old road bed at all \u2014 and no doubt there were stockholders across whose minds flashed occasional recollections of money sunk therein \u2014 supposed the project abandoned forever. However, during the \"flush\" times succeeding the war, when a good many peo ple ran wild after the almighty dollar, a \"coal\" company was formed in Newark, at the head of which were J. L. Birkey, William Shields, Lewis Evans, and some other well-known active bus iness men. They \"purchased\" a large amount of coal lands in Perry county, borrowed money largely, and proposed making themselves and"], [273, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 265 everybody else rich in a few days \u2014 or years. In order to get transportation for the coal with which they proposed to supply the United States, they revivified and put new life into the old railroad project. With commendable perse verance and industry they completed this road to Straitsville about 1875, beginning the work prob ably in 1873, or just before the beginning of the great financial panic. When this great coal scheme burst, and scattered fragments like a bomb-shell, a good many people in Licking county were hurt, and the old wounds are not yet entirely healed. One good it accomplished, however, was the completion of the Straitsville road, thus enabling Newark to get cheaper coal. Soon after completion, this road passed into the hands of the Baltimore & Ohio company, which still continues to operate it. In 1870 a railroad was projected from Toledo to Pomeroy, on the Ohio. It was intended to tap the coal-fields in the southern part of the State. It was called the Atlantic & Lake Erie; General Thomas Ewing was president. It met the usual fate of new roads; struggling along about nine years, when (in 1879) it was sold for debt, and passed into new hands. During these years the road-bed had been mostly constructed, the work being pushed vigorously all along the line. At pres ent (December, 1880), the larger part of the road from Fostoria, south, is finished, so that construc tion trains are passing over it, and it is called by the new company \"The Ohio Central.\" It passes through the counties of Lucas, Wood, Seneca, Wyandot, Crawford, Marion, Morrow, Knox, Lick ing, Fairfield, Perry, Athens, and Meigs. Erom the south it enters Licking county near Licking Summit, passing north along the canal to within two or three miles of Newark, when it makes a bend west, passing through Granville, Alexandria and Johnstown, leaving the county at the north west corner. Its line is generally through a very rich farming country. CHAPTER XXXIII. AGRICULTURE.

The records of 1834 show that the former was treasurer then. Israel Dille, esq., delivered addresses at the fairs in 1833 and 1834. 1837. \u2014 The list of the premiums awarded at the fifth annual fair held on the ninth and tenth days of October, 1837, aggregated only ninety-nine dol lars and fifty cents. Five dollars was the largest premium awarded to any one person, very few receiving even that small sum, and all were paid in salt spoons, dessert spoons, tea spoons, sugar tongs, sauce ladles, cream ladles, butter knives and the like. Rev. William Wylie, Dr. John J. Brice, Colonel \"Henceforth to labor's chivalry Be knightly honors paid; For nobler than the sword's shall be The sickle's accolade. \"Lay all the bloom of gardens there And there the orchard fruits; Bring golden grain from sun and air, From earth her goodly roots.\" \u2014 Whittier. THE first Licking county agricultural society was formed in 1832. General Thomas W. Wilson was elected president, and Israel Dille, secretary. The society held a fair every year on some out-lots or on lands adjacent to Newark, the above named officers continuing to act as late as 1838, and probably later. The late General Lucius Smith and the late E. S. Woods served this first"], [274, "266 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. miums. Basil Beall, Horace Wolcott and T. Mor ris were the three lucky ones. Mr. Beall, for raising ninety-five bushels of* corn per acre; Mr. Wolcott, for raising thirty- nine and one-half bushels of wheat per acre; and Mr. Morris, for exhibiting the best bull. Interest in the society was evidently on the wane. The premiums were generally smaller than hereto fore, the aggregate of awards amounting to less in dollars or spoons than the previous year; and the list of premiums awarded was somewhat reduced in number. Mr. Dille, the secretary, in remarking officially upon the fair, admitted that the articles presented were not of so varied a character as at former exhibitions, yet he insisted \"that as a fair, it was very creditable to our county, and tended to prove that the influence of the society had been highly beneficial, and that the blight of the season had been baffled in some measure, by industry and skill.\" At the fair in 1838, it was resolved to hold a meet ing of the members of the Licking County Agricul tural society, at the court house, in Newark, on the first Monday of December next, to appoint delegates to meet at Columbus, with delegates from other counties in the State, for the purpose of forming a State agricultural society, a measure that had been recommended by the directors of the Licking county society, on the eighth of October, and which had met with a favorable response in many portions of the State. This meeting was held in pursuance of the foregoing resolution, on the day named, and Hon. Israel Dille, General Thomas W. Wilson, and Judge Levi J. Haughey were appointed to repre sent Licking county in the State convention at Co lumbus, held on the nineteenth and twentieth days of December. It was a numerous meeting, in which all sections of the State were well repre sented, and a State agricultural society was organ ized, in which the three above named delegates took an active part, Mr. Dille being appointed one of the vice-presidents, and a member of the exec- utive committee, and General Wilson and Judge Haughey were among those chosen directors. The instrumentality of the society in taking the preliminary steps looking to the establishment of a State agricultural society, was its principal achievement in 1838. Its revenues were small, James Parker, and Mr. H. S. Sprague, highly re spectable gentlemen, representing the clerical, medical, military, legal, and artisan-mercantile professions, were appointed a sort of a committee at large on miscellaneous articles, who reported in writing to the extent of two or three newspaper squares, that they had, \"in pursuance of the duty assigned them, examined all the articles coming within the range of their inspection, and asked leave to present to the favorable consideration of the society, and through it to the public the follow ing articles,\" to wit: A tin reflecter, made by Isaac Smucker, to whom was awarded a cream ladle val ued at one dollar and fifty cents; and to E. W. Phelps they awarded a salt spoon, worth a dollar, for a turning machine. The only other miscella neous article offered was a \"power press,\" made by E. S. Scripture, who, however, obtained no premium, but the committee spoke well of it as a \"simple, cheap, and durable machine, well adapted to the making of cider and cheese, and anything else in which the application of power or pressure is required.\" The committee recommended a discretionary premium, but the society awarded none, at least none appears in the list of premiums, which occupies half a column of the Licking Ohio Democrat. The editor of said paper (Mr. Clark Dunham), of date November 15, 1837, says \"the fair went off with its usual eclat, and that he was pleased to see that interest taken in the society, which the good it is annually accomplishing, ren ders it worthy of receiving. The society, during the five years in which it has been in operation, has exerted a very beneficial influence upon the farming interest, which may be seen in the improve ment in stock, particularly in cattle.\" Addresses were delivered at this fair by Hon. Israel Dille and by Robert H. Caffee, esq., a young lawyer who had just been admitted to the bar, son of the late Amos H. Caffee, esq., one of our most prom- inent citizens. The succeeding issue of the Dem- ocrat contains those addresses, Mr. Dille's occupy-^ ing more tnan four columns ot the paper, and Mr. Cafiee's more than two columns. Both addresses are well written and instructive. 1838. \u2014 The fair for 1838 was held November 1st, the premiums awarded amounting to eighty-six dollars, only three of them being five dollar pre-"], [275, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 267 Thirty-three persons present at that meeting hav ing manifested a wish to organize a county agri cultural society, it was on motion of David Smith, esq., resolved to appoint a committee of five gen tlemen to report a constitution and by-laws for the government of said society, about to be formed; whereupon. David Smith, esq., General Thomas W, Wilson, Henry C. Taylor, James H. Moore, and Major Elisha Warren were appointed said committee, who reported a constitution and by laws, which were adopted by the meeting. The organization of the society was then completed by the election of officers, Thomas W. Wilson being elected president; Henry C. Taylor, vice-presi dent; Israel Dille, secretary; E. S. Woods, treas urer, and Elisha Warren, P. N. O'Bannon, Benja min Turner, J. H. Moore and William S. Wright, were chosen directors. The fair was held October nth and 12th. Premiums to the amount of one hundred and fifty-eight dollars and fifty cents were awarded. Addresses were delivered by Israel Dille, esq., and by M. B. Bateham, esq., editor of the Ohio Culti vator, an agricultural paper published in Colum bus. The members of the society this year numbered one hundred and eighty-seven. James H. Moore was the representative to the State society. 1849. \u2014 The officers of the society in 1849 were Henry C. Taylor, esq., president; P. N. O'Bannon, vice-president; James H. Moore, secretary; H. S. Sprague, treasurer; Andrew Taylor, David Smith, W. S. Wright, J. M. Fleming, and V. B. Alsdorf, directors. Henry C. Taylor and James H. Moore, were chosen delegates to the State agricultural convention. The membership this year numbered one hundred and thirty, and paid two hundred and thirty-nine dollars and fifty cents in premiums. This year's fair was a great improvement on that of the preceding year. Its revenues, including a balance in the treasury for last year, of one hun dred and eighty-three dollars and forty-seven cents, amounted to five hundred and thirty-five dollars and ninety-five cents, and the expenditures footed up to three hundred and twenty-six dollars and thirty-five. cents. The Licking Herald said: \"The attendance was very large and that in every point of view was exceedingly gratifying, and that exceedingly small; the number of its members was small; its exhibitors were small in number; its pre miums were small in amount, and awarded to a small number of exhibitors; the attendants at its fairs were small in number; indeed, it was the \"day of small things\" with it from beginning to end; nevertheless it served a valuable purpose and made itself efficient for good as was manifest in our improved and constantly improving stock, and in the better culture of the farms of our county. How long the society continued to hold annual fairs after the one above named, held in 1838, it is impossible to state with certainty. But it is known that the annual fairs were omitted for a number of years before the organization of tbe present society, which has held its thirty-third annual fair, and which was established in 1848. In brief, the original so ciety of 1832 died some years before the organiza tion of the present very flourishing society, in 1848, but just when it \"ceased to be\" is not known; but it certainly was between the years 1838 and 1848. It had its day, served its generation well in a small way, accomplished some good, and died, probably a victim of the political tornado of 1840. The present Licking County Agricultural society was organized in 1848. The preliminary steps for its organization were taken at their monthly meet ing in January, 1848, by the Madison Township Farmers' club, which, on motion of James H. Moore, appointed a committee of three to prepare an address in favor of the encouragement of agri. culture by the establishment of a county agricult ural society. The committee, which consisted of Judge William O'Bannon, David Smith, esq., and the secretary of the club, Mr. B. F. Wheeler, acted promptly and their address was adopted by the club, and published in the Newark Advocate of February 5, 1848, accompanied by some favorable editorial remarks. The address concluded with a resolution calling upon the farmers of Licking county to meet on the ensuing fourth day of March, at the court house, in Newark, for the pur pose of forming themselves into an association for the advancement of the interests of agriculturalists in the county. The proposed meeting was held accordingly, its officers being General Jonathan Taylor, president; Judge O'Bannon, vice-presi dent; and Mr. William S. Wright, secretary."], [276, "268 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. its benefits could not fail to be seen and felt in all departments of agriculture and the mechanics arts.\" The fair was held on the third and fourth days of October. From this time forward the president of the society was usually the repre sentative in the State agricultural convention. 1850. \u2014 The officers of the society for 1850 were as follows: Henry C. Taylor, president; P. N. O'Bannon, vice-president; George F. Moore, secretary; H. S. Sprague, treasurer; William S. Wright, A. Taylor, William Barrick, David Smith, and T. S. O'Bannon, directors. The fair this year was held October thirtieth and thirty-first. Pro fessor Pratt, of Granville college, delivered an able and interesting address. The members num bered one hundred and fifty, and two hundred and ninety-one dollars were paid as premiums. Mr. George F. Moore represented the society in the annual meeting of the Ohio State board of agri culture this year. There was an increased interest manifested in the fair, the attendance being much larger than in any previous year. Professor Pratt's a ddress was published. State fairs were inaugu rated by the State board of agriculture this year. 1 85 1. \u2014 Henry C. Taylor was elected president of the society for 1851; P. N. O'Bannon, vice president; George F. Moore, secretary; H. S. Sprague, treasurer ; T. S. O'Bannon, W. S. Wright, David Smith, Andrew Taylor and William Barrick, directors. The secretary wrote to the Western Agriculturist that \"the fair went off well, one hundred cattle, near two hundred sheep and one hundred and sixty horses being exhibited.\" This. the fourth fair held by the society, was doubtless a greater success than those that preceded it. The members this year numbered two hundred and fifty-six, and the amount of premiums paid was two hundred and fifty-six dollars. The president represented the society this year in the State Ag ricultural convention. The fair was held October 16th and 17th. 1852. \u2014 For r852 the officers chosen were P. N. O'Bannon, president; William S. Wright, vice- president; George F. Moore, secretary; H. S. Sprague, treasurer, and T. S. O'Bannon, John Reed, Samuel Bowlsby, James A. Taylor and E. Follett, directors. The fair was more largely at- tended than ever before; the receipts were larger, also, and the entries numbered more than seven hundred, among them being one of the swine family that weighed nine hundred and ninety pounds. It was held October 14th and r5th. On the last day Hon. Isaac J. Allen, then of Mansfield, gave an admirable address, which, like that of Professor Pratt, was published in pamphlet form. William S. Wright was delegate in the State board meeting. 1853. \u2014 The officers in 1853 were William S. Wright, president; J. A. Tavlor, vice-president; G. F. Moore, secretary; H. S. Sprague, treasurer; William Barrick, Jonathan Smith, V. B. Alsdorf, J. H. Moore and H. B. McClelland, directors. Total number of members this year was three hundred and ninety-seven, and the treasurer re ported the receipts to be one thousand one hun dred and two dollars and forty-seven cents, and the expenditures nine hundred and ninety-two dollars and forty-seven cents, showing the profits to have been one hundred and ten dollars. The fair was held October 7th and 8th, and was eminently successful in both the number of entries and the excellence of articles and animals ex hibited. The best yield of corn on a single acre, reported this year, was one hundred and forty bushels, for which the first premium was awarded to Charles H. Coe. William S. Wright was the delegate to the State Agricultural convention. One of the most important events in the history of tbe society, during the year 1853, was the pur chase by it of a portion of the grounds they now own and occupy, including the part known as the \"Old Fort.\" The purchase first made was a tract of twelve and eighty-six one-hundredths acres, the deed for which, made by Henry Holler and wife, bears date December 13, 1853, the consideration being eight hundred and thirty-five dollars and ninety cents. Another purchase of twenty-nine and ninety-eight one-hundredths acres was made of Nathan H. Seymour, the deed bearing date December 22, 1853, the consideration being two thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight dollars. The money for paying for the foregoing tracts of land was principally raised by subscriptions ob tained from the people of the county at large. 1854. \u2014 The officers of the society in r854 were William S. Wright, president; Jonathan Smith,"], [277, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 269 vice-president; H. S. Sprague, treasurer. Eli B. Beckwith was elected secretary and served as such until May, when he resigned. E. Abbot and M. M. Munson served temporarily to the close of the year. Kinsey Hull, George F. Moore, E. Abbot, Jacob Winter, and P. N. O'Bannon, were elected directors. A very successful fair was held on the new fair grounds on the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth days of October, the premiums awarded amount ing to five hundred and seventy-seven dollars and twenty-five cents, the receipts from memberships and admissions being a little in excess of that sum. A rain on the two last days seriously affect ed the receipts, and impaired the usefulness of the fair, this year. The State fair, which was held on the grounds of the society the week after, also tended to diminish the number of attendants, as many of our people who attended only one fair, preferred to be present at the State fair, and many, also, who intended to be at both, were pre vented by the rain from being at the county fair. Hon. Samuel Sheliabarger was the orator of the society this year, and delivered an able address, which came out in pamphlet form. W. S. Wright was the delegate to the State board convention. The successful State fair held on our fair grounds this year was one of the important events of 1854. An addition of about four acres to the fair grounds of the society, as a gift virtually, from Mr. William S. Wright, the deed bearing date December 13, 1854, was a matter of no small importance to the society, and the generous act deserves honorable mention. Including this gift, the grounds of the society aggregated nearly forty-seven acres in 1854. In 1869, for the sum of two hundred and fifteen dollars, Abraham Lucas and wife conveyed a small parcel of land to the society for road purposes, the deed bearing date September fourteenth of said year; and on the twenty-third of April, 1870, Evan Jones and wife sold to the society about five and one-quarter acres of ground for the sum of thirteen hundred and sixty dollars, which, added to the previous purchases, not including the road way, made an aggregate of a fraction over fifty-two acres, which is the extent at present of the socie ty's domains, obtained at a cost of five thousand four hundred and nine dollars. The grounds are thought by some to be inadequate to the wants of the society, and a further addition to them is urged. The \"old fort,\" which is, in its entirety, within the grounds of the society, and outside of which, and nearly all around it, are the hundreds of sheds for the sheltering and safe keeping of the stock on exhibition at the fairs, is one of the most interest- ing and extensive of the works of the Mound Builders in the Ohio valley. A description of it will be found in the chapter on Newark township. 1855. \u2014 The following gentlemen composed the board of officers of the Licking County Agricul- tural society in 1855: Jonathan Smith, president; Thomas S. O'Bannon, vice-president; William M. Cunningham, treasurer; Thomas J. Davis, secre- tary; E. Abbott, Jacob Winter, David Smith, John Brumback, and William Alsdorf, directors. Fair was held September 25th, 26th, and 27th. Pre- miums were awarded to the amount of seven hun- dred and fifty dollars. Professor Armor delivered the address, which was well received, and a copy solicited for publication. The fair was successful. Ladies' riding match was one of the features of the fair of 1855. Thanks were voted to the Utica band, for services. The receipts from all sources amounted to two thousand six hundred and ten dollars. 1856. \u2014 The officers in 1856 were: Jonathan Smith, president; Thomas S. O'Bannon, vice- president; Thomas J. Davis, secretary; William M. Cunningham, treasurer; William Alsdorf, Joseph Pence, James Pittsford, John Brumback, and George W. Penny, directors. The fair was held on the eighth and ninth days of October, and was successful, the receipts amounting to nine hundred and seventy-four dollars and fifty cents. 1857. \u2014 In 1857 the officers were: Thomas S. O'Bannon, president: William Alsdorf, vice-presi- dent; T. J. Davis, secretary; William M. Cun- ningham, treasurer; Joseph Pence, James Pittsford, William Maholm, J. S. Griffith, and Daniel Gard- ner, directors. Fair was held on the seventh and eighth days of October. The receipts from all sources, reported by the treasurer, amounted to one thousand four hundred and sixty-four dollars and forty-two cents. 1858\u2014 The officers for 1858 were; William Als-"], [278, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 2 7\u00b0 dors, president; Joseph Pence, vice-president; William M. Cunningham, treasurer; Thomas J. Davis, secretary ; William Maholm, Jacob S. Grif fiths, William S. Wright, John A. Miller, and George J. Hagerty, directors. Fair was held Octo ber 6th and 7th. Eleven hundred and eighty eight membership tickets were sold. The total receipts from all sources during the fair amounted to two thousand one hundred and three dollars and seventy-five cents, and the secretary officially declared this fair the largest ever held in the county. 1862. \u2014 The following is the list of officers of the society for 1862, elected December 14, r86i, to-wit: President, James Pittsford; vice-president, David Smith; secretary, A. Adair; treasurer, T. J. Davis; directors, William Sherman, Willis Robbins, M. M. Munson, and James Larimore. Fair was held on the first, second and third days of October, with a fair attendance. 1863. \u2014 The officers for 1863, the election being held January 3d, of said year, were as follows : James Pittsford, president; David Smith, vice president; A.

M. Miller, president; Thomas W. Mont gomery, vice-president; J. F. Lingafelter, secretary; I. W. Bigelow, treasurer ; Andrew Weiant, Henry L.

Fair was held Sep tember 28th, 29th, 30th, and October 1st, and the receipts were six thousand six hundred and twenty eight dollars and thirty-five cents. Pursuant to a resolution of the society, Isaac Smucker prepared the foregoing outline history of the county agricultural societies. The following relating to the products of this county is taken from the State Agricultural Report for 1879, and from it may be gleaned some inter esting facts connected with that most important branch of industry : \"Wheat, thirty thousand nine hundred acres sown, produc ing four hundred and seventy thousand eight hundred and fifty one bushels, or about fifteen and one-fourth bushels to the acre. This is several bushels above the average in the State, showing this county to be somewhat superior for wheat culture. Rye, one thousand three hundred and forty-two acres sown, produc ing nineteen thousand and eighty-five bushels ; buckwheat, four hundred and ninety-three acres sown, product, five thou sand six hundred and eight bushels ; oats, eleven thousand six hundred and nine acres, product, three hundred and sixty-three thousand and sixty-two bushels ; barley, fifteen acres, product, four hundred and thirty-eight bushels; corn, fifty-five thousand four hundred and nineteen acres, product, two million three hundred and fifty-one thousand five hundred and fifty-one bushels ; timothy, thirty thousand eight hundred and sixty-five acres sown, product, forty-two thousand six hundred and eighty-five tons of hay ; clover, three thousand one hundred and forty-five acres, product, two thousand eight hundred and ninety-three tons of hay, and one thousand five hundred and eighty bushels of seed ; flax, two hundred and twenty-nine acres, product, two thousand four hundred and twenty-four bushels of seed ; potatoes, one thousand six hundred and sixty acres, product, one hundred and twenty-two thousand two hundred and forty-eight bushels. This is an average of nearly seventy-four bushel* to the acre \u2014 an average reached by but few counties in the State. Sweet potatoes, fourteen acres, pro duct, five hundred and twenty-three bushels; tobacco, two acres, product, one thousand nine hundred and seventy pounds; sorghum, one hundred and fifty-nine acres, product, two hun dred and forty-six pounds of sugar, and twenty thousand five hundred and forty-six gallons of syrup; maple sugar, nine thousand and twenty-one pounds, and thirteen thousand five hundred and eleven gallons of syrup ; hives of bees, three thou sand three hundred and eighty-two, product, forty-nine thou sand nine hundred and thirty-one pounds of honey. Only six counties in the State produce more honey than this. The total number of acres of land in the county is three hundred and seventy thousand six hundred and seventy-six, of which, one hundred and thirteen thousand eight hundred and three acres are cultivated, one hundred and seventy-eight thousand four hundred and thirty-eight pasture, seventy-four thousand nine hundred and sixty-nine wood-land, and three thousand four hundred and sixty-six uncultivated or waste land. It will be seen that the waste land in the county is much less than would be surmised, considering the large surface of hill, or upland ; in this, also, it compares favorably with any other in the State. \"In the production of butter it excels, the number of pounds being eight hundred and sixty thousand eight hundred and sixty-nine ; few counties in the State excel this amount. The production of cheese was six thousand nine hundred and ten pounds, which compares favorably with other counties of the State, outside of the Reserve. It is a fact worth noting that the production of butter in the State has been steadily increas ing for the last two decades ; having advanced from thirty-eight million four hundred and forty thousand four hundred and ninety-eight pounds in 1860, to fifty million three hundred and thirty-two thousand and twenty-three pounds in r878. \"Of live stock, this county contained \u2014 horses, eleven thou sand seven hundred and thirty-three, valued at six hundred and thirty-eight thousand eight hundred and eighty-three dollars ; cattle, twenty-seven thousand nine hundred and ninety-four, valued at five hundred and sixty-five thousand six hundred and seventy-seven dollars ; mules, one hundred and eighty, valued at ten thousand two hundred and ninety dollars ; hogs, thirty-three thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine, valued at mnetv-six thousand one hundred and eighty-one dollars ; sheep, two hun dred and nineteen thousand eight hundred and eighty-five. valued at five hundred and thirty-six thousand nine hundred and ninety-one dollars. In the raising of sheep and the pro duction of wool, this county largely excels ; indeed this may be said to be the \"banner'' wool county in the State. No other county can show a number of sheep equal to the above. Harrison comes the nearest, but falls more than twenty-five thousand short. Regarding the wool product, it was nine hun dred and seven thousand one hundred and eighty-four pounds, which is more by several hundred thousand pounds than most other counties, and excels Harrison, which stands second-best, by more than one hundred and sixty thousand pounds. The county had five hundred and twenty-two sheep killed by dogs, which is a large number, but less in proportion than some other counties. It is worthy of note that the number of sheep killed by dogs within the State has gradually decreased in the last decade. The destruction of sheep reached its height in 1869, when it appears that fifty-two thousand four hundred and eleven were killed ; in 1878 the number was only twenty-four thousand six hundred and eighty-four, or less than half."], [282, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 274 \"In horticulture, the county is not behind; indeed, in many productions of this character, it excels. The number of acres in orchards is six thousand nine hundred and thirty-three ; pro ducing six hundred and twenty thousand six hundred and forty two bushels of apples, forty-nine thousand two hundred and five bushels of peaches, and two thousand and sixteen bushels of pears! Few counties in the State produce in excess of the above figures, the larger majority falling much behind them. The grape and wine production is comparatively good, but this industry is yet evidently in its infancy.\" CHAPTER XXXIV. BENCH, BAR, PUBLIC BUILDINGS.

FOR judicial and other purposes, the territory now forming Licking county, belonged to Wash ington county from 1788 to 1 798; from 1798 to 1800 it was part of Ross county, and from 1800 to 1808, a part of Fairfield; since the latter date it has had a separate existence as a county. It will be observed that the county seats have been Mari etta, Chillicothe, Lancaster and Newark, respec tively. For eleven years (from 1788 to 1799) the citizens of the county and State were under the first grade of territorial government; from 1799 to 1803, a period of four years, they were under the second grade of territorial government, and from 1803 to the present time, under a State government. Under the first grade of territorial government, this territory had no representation in legislature (there being no legislature,) or Congress; under the second grade there was a legislature, only one branch of which was elected by the peo ple; and a delegate in congress elected by this legislature, who, however, had not the right to vote on questions before that body. Since 1803, the people of this county, in common with those of other counties, have enjoyed all the rights and privileges of a free and independent people, with representatives in both branches of the legislature, and of Congress, of their own selection. Prior to 1808, all business connected with the court, was transacted at Chillicothe and Lancaster, but in this year the county of Licking was organ ized with the following as its first judicial and county officers: William Wilson, president judge of common pleas court; Alexander Holmes, Tim othy Rose and James Taylor, associate judges; Samuel Bancroft, clerk of court; John Stadden, sheriff; Elias Gilman, treasurer; Archibald Wilson, Elisha Wells and Israel Wells, commissioners; John Stadden, collector of taxes; Elias Gilman, commissioners' clerk ; Archibald Wilson, jr., asses sor of Licking township; Jeremiah Munson, asses sor of Granville township. The first court was held in the house of Levi Hays four miles west of Newark, and two miles east of Granville. There not being room in the house, the grand jury held its inquest under a tree. During the year a board of commissioners consist ing of James Dunlap, Isaac Cook and James Armstrong, selected Newark as the permanent county seat. At that date this county contained but the two townships above named. The Newark bar and bench have been honored by many men of talent. Among the first of these was William Wilson, above mentioned as the first president judge. He was a New Englander, educated at Dartmouth college, and settled at Chillicothe as an attorney. He remained on the"], [283, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 275 bench until 1823, when he was elected to Congress and served four years, and until his death in 1827. Alexander Holmes, another of the county's honored officers and pioneers, came here in 1802, from Brooke county, Virginia. He followed sur veying several years, surveying much in the State for the general government, as well as the larger part of Licking county; he also made the first complete survey of the ancient works in the vicinity of Newark. He held the position of associate judge from 1808 until 18 12, and was again elected in 1823, serving until 1828. In this capacity he was upright, intelligent, incorruptible. He was a man of considerable natural ability, and identified himself with the interests and early history of this county. Samuel Bancroft, the first clerk, afterward be came associate judge, serving from 1824 to 1845. He was born in Granville, Massachusetts, in t778; was well educated, and spent the earlier years of his life in teaching. In 1806, he came to this county, settling in Granville township, where, in 1807, he married Miss Clarissa Rose, this being the first marriage solemnized in that township. He was in the war of 18 12, as a private soldier, and was surrendered by General Hull. He was a jus tice of the peace eighteen years; a judge twenty one years, and was a faithful, efficient officer. He died January 22, 1870, in his ninety -second year; his great longevity being due to his regular and temperate habits of living, rather than his consti tution or physical strength. James Taylor was born in Pennsylvania, in 1753, and after his marriage in 1780, he moved to western Virginia. In 1782 he was in the William son expedition against the Moravian Indians on the Tuscarawas, and had the honor of voting, with seventeen others, against the murder of their In dian captives, but without avail. Judge Taylor served as associate judge only from 1808 to 1809. He had served his country during the Revolution ary war, and was a man of character and intelli gence. His death took place in 1844, at the ad vanced age of ninety-one years. Timothy Rose was one of the original Granville colony of 1S05, a few of whom now survive. He was an associate judge from 1S08 to 1S13, when he died. Judge Rose was a high-toned, in- tellectual and intelligent gentleman, and a man os high character, of sound judgment, and undoubted patriotism. He served in the Revolutionary war and distinguished himself as an officer, at the storming of a British redoubt, at the surrender of Cornwallis, at Yorktown in 1781. Probably more prominent than any other man at the Licking county bar, was Hon. William Stan berry. He fought his battle of life in the days of \"Tom\" Corwin, \"Tom\" Ewing, and other such intellectual giants as Ohio delights to honor and remember. He was born August 10, 1788, in Essex county, New Jersey. His most valuable inheritance was a sound and vigorous constitution, a commanding presence and a high order of talents. He had fair early educational opportunities, and im proved them faithfully; he also had superior ad vantages as a law student in the office of Judge Pendleton, of New York city, of which he availed himself. Attendance on the courts of the city, in which the attorneys were such men as Thomas Addis Emmet, Aaron Burr, Alexander Hamilton, Daniel D. Tompkins and Martin VanBuren, and where men of the distinguished ability of DeWitt Clinton occupied judicial seats, afforded him facilities for improvement which he greatly prized and studi ously heeded. Highly beneficial to him, also, were the literary clubs of that day, where his associates were James K. Paulding, Julian C. Verplanck, Washington Irying, and other contemporary celeb rities. His participation in the discussion of po litical questions, when quite young, tended to develope his oratorical powers, and his early efforts as a public speaker gave promise of future emi nence as a popular orator. His pursuit of knowl edge was most ardent and persevering, and he ulti mately acquired a large fund of information in literature, belles letters and the classics. In 1S09, Mr. Stanberry located in Newark, re maining here until his death, a period of sixty-four years. He became distinguished as a successful criminal lawyer, and was generally retained in im portant criminal cases in this and adjoining coun ties which composed his \"circuit.\" He was in the habit, as were other lawyers, of traveling with the court, which in those early days was on wheels, as"], [284, "276 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. it were, and went about through the woods dis pensing justice. Under these circumstances he frequently appeared in Mt. Vernon, Mansfield and other frontier towns, where he found plenty of clients. His successful argument in behalf of David Shaver, his defence of Peter Dimond, charged with murder, and his great speech in a case involv ing the question of conflicting jurisdiction between the National and State governments, in relation to the Wyandot reservation on the Sandusky plains, were among his most celebrated exhibitions of forensic power. His oratorical efforts were usu ally characterized by argumentation, sometimes by invective, and uniformly by declamation and flu ency, and often by much power and eloquence. Mr. Stanberry also practiced several years in the Federal courts, with such men as Henry Clay, James Ross, Henay Baldwin, Philip Doddridge, John C. Wright, Judge Burnet, Charles Hammond, Benjamin Tappan, Edward King, Thomas Ewing, Thomas Corwin, and others alike eminent at the bar. Mr. Stanberry was the last survivor of all these early time lawyers. All those mentioned, and others who \"rode the circuit\" and practiced with him in the early courts, including Mr. Merwin, Major Munson, General Beecher, Judge Sherman, General Goddard, Hocking H. Hunter, General Herrick, Wyllis Silliman, Orris Parrish, Judge Ir win, Judge Harper, Samuel W. Culbertson, and Judge Searle \u2014 all are dead. He was elected to the senate of Ohio in 1824, and served two sessions in that body. In 1827, he was elected to Congress, to serve out the unex pired term of Judgs Wilson, deceased. In 1828, he was re-elected, and again in 1830, making five years' service in that body, during which he prom inently identified himself with many measures of public interest, chief of which was the law grant ing half a million acres of public lands to aid in the prosecution of the canal interests of the State. He died in January, 1873, aged eighty-five years. Colonel B. B. Taylor was for a time a member of the bar of this county. He came to Newark in his youth, studied law, and was for some years a practicing lawyer in the city; but his taste for politics and literature led him into other channels, and prevented his success at the bar. He was, at different times, editor of a magazine in Columbus, published by Samuel Medary; the Kentucky States- man, published at Lexington, Kentucky; a paper in Missouri, another in Portland, Oregon, and probably others. His last removal was to Mexico, Missouri, where he settled for the purpose of re- suming the practice of law, but before getting fair- ly established he died, January 27, 1877, in his sixty-eighth year. Amos H. Caffee was born in Bucks county, Pennsylvania, in 1790, where he remained until he reached manhood. The west, at that time present- ing a field of great promise of reward to the indus- trious, energetic and enterprising, he decided to make the then rising State of Ohio his future home. After spending some months in the effort to find a suitable location, he was directed by a train of favorable circumstances to Newark, where he settled in November, 181 1, and where he was an honored citizen more than fifty years. Mr. Caffee, being a young man of more than ordinary intellectual endowments and correctness of de- portment, soon attracted attention, and was, by common consent, assigned a prominent part in all educational and other movements, having for their objects the improvement and elevation of the peo- ple, and the advancement of the interests of the town. As a reward for his superiority he was fre- quently favored with positions of trust and respon- sibility. He long held the offices of mayor, post- master, and clerk of the several courts of the county, always discharging with fidelity and honor the duties of his positions. He died at the age of seventy-two years. Hon. Corrington W. Searle came to Newark from the Wyoming valley in Pennsylvania, where he was born, near the close of the last century. He was a respectable member of the Licking county bar, and as early as 1824 was prosecuting attorney, and served until 1832. Aftei that he was for a time associated with Judge Wyllis Silli- man, in the practice of law. In 1836 he was elected judge of the court of common pleas, and remained on the bench until 1843. Judge Searle was a good lawyer, and discharged the duties of judge with credit and honor to himself. After his retirement from the bench he removed to Zanes- ville, where he died a number of years ago, and"], [285, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 277 where several of his children are at present living. Samuel M. Browning was one of Newark's law yers of fifty years ago. He was scholarly and accomplished, genial and studious. In 1833 ne was elected mayor of Newark, and again in 1836, but resigned the office before his term expired, and removed to Mount Vernon. Colonel James Parker came to Newark as a merchant from Amboy, New Jersey, in 1829, and soon after commenced the study of law, and in due time entered upon its practice. In 1834 he was elected a member of the council, and became prosecuting attorney in 1836, in which office he served four years. From 1842 to 1844 he was Slate senator. He afterwards removed to Cincin nati, where he was elected a judge of the court of common pleas, and where he died some years after the expiration of his term of service on the bench. Hon. George H. Flood came from Zanesville, of which place he was a native, to Newark in 1837, to practice law. In 1838 and again in r839 he was elected a member of the State legislature, in which body he became an active and prominent member. Towards the close of President Van Buren's term of office he appointed Mr. Flood charge d'affaires to the Republic of Texas, where he died not long after. Hon. Samuel White was one of our earlier law yers, and a full biographical sketch of him is given in the chapter on the Welsh Hills settlement. Daniel Humphrey was also one of the early lawyers of Licking county. The various offices he held are set forth in our chapters on county offi cers, and on city officers. He died many years ago. Hon. Joshua Mathiot was a prominent member of the Licking county bar. He was a native of Connellsville, Fayette county, Pennsylvania, and came to Newark, Ohio, about the year 1820, be fore he had fully reached manhood, and when it was yet a small village. Joshua Mathiot w-as am bitious, and availed himself of every opportunity to acquire an education suitable and requisite for the profession of the law. Having acquired that, he entered the law office of General Samuel Her rick, of Zanesville, and after pursuing his law studies for several years, he was admitted to the bar, and soon succeeded in acquiring an extensive 8 law practice. He was elected prosecuting attorney of the county in 1832, and served until 1836. In 1834 he was elected mayor of Newark. Hon. Joshua Mathiot was for a time associated with his father-in-law, Samuel W. Culbertson, esq., of Zanes ville, in the practice of law, and afterwards with Judge Buckingham, who had been a law student in his office. Samuel White, esq., had also studied law in his office. He also entered into politics with a good deal of energy, and was elected a member of Congress in 1840, the district being composed of the counties of Muskingum and Licking. Hon. Joshua Mathiot died suddenly, in 1849, when he had barely reached the \"noon of life,\" leaving his widow and several children, one of whom was the wife of Rev. Dr. Cuyler, of Brook lyn, to mourn the loss of one who had been pre eminently faithful and devoted as husband and father. He was a man of correct deportment, and exemplary in all the relations of life, always giving the weight of his influence on the side of philan thropy, good morals, temperance, and the institu tions of Christianity. In 1822 the first Presbyterian church, of Newark, organized a Sunday-school, and the records show that Joshua Mathiot was chosen one of its man agers. The church was generously supported by him, and educational enterprises and temperance or ganizations were liberally upheld and sustained by him. The many admirable traits of character he possessed secured him numerous and warm friends. His circle of friends and acquaintances was large, and they were as warm in their attachment and de votion, as they were numerous. It may be safely said that we have had but few men among us who more largely enjoyed the public confidence than Colonel Joshua Mathiot. Lucius Case was born in Connecticut, November 8, 1813. He spent his youth and early manhood in his native State, where he received a common school education. He, however, completed his education at the Wesleyan university, at Middle town, and adopted the legal profession as his per manent pursuit. He studied law with Judge Phelps, of Hartford, finishing with Judge Finch, of Delaware, Ohio, whose office he entered in 1834. He settled first in Hocking county, but came to"], [286, "278 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. In 1840, his health having failed, he abandoned the active practice of his profession, and sought relief by travel; visiting the entire region from New York to New Orleans. He became familiar with the geology of the whole country, and knew the rivers, watersheds, and the resources in min eral wealth of the Mississippi valley, from its mouth to the copper mines of Lake Superior. Possessed as he was of rare accomplishments, he was, withal, very communicative, and, there fore, an instructive and valuable companion. Pos sessing those qualities, one of his rare intelligence and suavity of manner could not fail to be most attractive as a conversationalist, and most charm ing in social intercourse. Mr. Dille was, for a number of years, a popular lecturer on geology. He was also one of the vice presidents of the Union Academy of Arts and Sciences, at Washington city, and contributed a paper on the cosmogony of Moses, which was published, and attracted very considerable atten tion, especially from the clergy. He also excelled as a newspaper writer, as a pamphleteer, and as a contributor to the magazines and quarterly re views. After the commencement of the war of the Re bellion, he went to Washington, and became con nected with the internal revenue office, then in Jts infancy, where he remained until his death, which occurred at his home, in Washington city, after a very brief illness, on January 10, 1874, in the seventy-second year of his age. Mr. Dille was always full of benevolent schemes for the benefit of society, and looking out for the interests of the future. At his very last visit to his old home in Newark, an incident occurred which illustrates this trait in his character. He was met by a deputation of citizens with an address of gratitude for something that he had done thirty or forty years before. It seems that when Newark was a small village, he was chosen its mayor; and in pursuance of his usual dispo sition to look after the interests of the future he undertook to beautify what is now known as Court House square. He graded the grounds, filled up the depressions, and planted it around with elms. His work made, perhaps, little show at the time, but the years moved along, and the Newark in 1841, where he continued in successful practice until his death, which occurred July 23, 1864, while in the prime of life. He was a mem ber of the Constitutional convention of 1850, and participated actively in the debates of that body. He was a man of vigorous intellect, improved by education and select reading. Of the later members of the bar of Newark, who have more recently passed from the stage of action, perhaps none were more prominent than Judge Israel Dille and S. D. King. The former was born at Dille's bottom (so called on account of his father's ownership) in August, 1802, on the Ohio river, in what was then the Northwest Terri tory, now Belmont county, Ohio. While still an infant, his father removing to Cuyahoga county, he was transported thence across what was then an almost unbroken, trackless forest, in the arms of his mother, who made the entire journey on horse back. His only opportunity for education was the few books which formed the library of his father, among which was a work on astronomy, which was his special study and delight, and which created that taste for astronomy and meteorology which he evinced in after life. When about fifteen, he en tered school at Washington, Pennsylvania, where some of the friends of the family lived. About 1825, he was a teacher at Somerset, Perry county, Ohio, and at the same time a law student with the late Hocking H. Hunter, of Lancaster, Ohio, to whom he went at intervals for recitation. After his admission to the bar, he settled at Newark, and very soon attracted attention as a lawyer of great ability, and won the respect and friendship of such men as Thomas Ewing, Hocking H. Hunter, and William Stanberry, by whom he was regarded as a peer, and with whom he argued many impor tant law cases. He was untiring in the acquisition of legal lore, indefatigable in the pursuit of knowl. edge, laborious as a student of science, philoso. phy, and literature; geology, mineralogy, belles lettres and speculative philosophy were his favor ite studies. By diligence and laborious investiga tion he acquired such a fund of information as is possessed by comparatively few men. So exten sive and diversified were his general information and knowledge that he had few equals."], [287, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 279 trees grew, till now they are the beauty and glory of the place, and the citizens who are enjoying the benefits of his beneficent labors, may well hold him in grateful remembrance. S. D. King was a native of Berkeley county, now West Virginia, but came to Ohio in early life, com pleting his education at the Ohio university. After graduating, he studied law, was admitted to the bar, and located in Newark for the practice of his profession, about fifty-two years ago. He soon attained to a position of prominence as a lawyer, and had an extensive and lucrative practice, which he retained through a period of at least one full generation. His conspicuously successful career brought him wealth, honors, and friends. He had but little ambition for public life, and, therefore, seldom sought the suffrages of his fellow citizens; he, however, sometimes accepted positions that gave him opportunities to aid in promoting edu cational and Christian interests; he also served as prosecuting attorney, and as a member of the State legislature. His influence was always in favor of the right as he saw it. He outlived all his cotemporaries and died April 20, 1880, at the ripe age of eighty years. Several other men of eminent ability have been, and some are yet, connected with the Newark bar, whose biographies will be found elsewhere in this work. The older members of the present bar of New ark are Messrs. George B. Smythe, C. H. Kibler, James R. Stanbery, H. D. Sprague, Jerome Buck ingham, Charles Follett and Gibson Atherton. The younger members who are coming upon the stage of action and whose full success is yet to be determined by the future, are Joel Dennis, J. B. Jones, John D. Jones, B. G. Smythe, Jesse Flory, James W. Owens, John 'H. James, D. A. Allen, John M. Swartz, J. R. Davies, Judge S. M. Hunter, William A. King, George Grasser, James Lingafelter, W. Taylor, C. Norpel, C. Follett, jr., E. M. P. Brister, L. P. Coman, William Baker, A. B. Barrick, Perry Veach, Clark Barrows, J. E. Law head, Thomas Thornton, George P. Webb, Theo dore Kemp, Charles F. Bryan and L B. Harris. Little need be said of the building in which these men fought their battles, so far as this county is concerned. All the court houses \u2014 four in num- ber \u2014 have occupied the public square. The first one stood a little north of the present building; was built of logs, and when first erected the floor was mother earth, either bare or covered with saw dust. It was a square pen, one or two stories in height (statements differing regarding this), the seats were slabs or puncheons laid upon blocks of wood. It was in perfect keeping with the cabins of the settlers, and was erected in 1809 or 1810, serving all the purposes of a court house until about 1815, when another was. erected. This one was stylish, comparatively; being built of brick, two stories in height, thirty or forty feet square, surmounted with a roof which sloped from either side to the center, upon which rested the square cupola. The upper part of this building was oc cupied as a court room, and the lower part for offices, there being an office in each corner. This building stood about where the present one stands, as did also the one which immediately succeeded it. About 1832 it became necessary to erect a new one. The old one was not only too small for the accom modation of the increased business, but it had been poorly constructed and was beginning to decay; it was, therefore, taken down, and another brick structure erected in its place, which, however, was but little improvement upon the old one except that it was larger. It consisted of two stories and a basement, and was built something after the style of the old court house in Richland county, and shows that certain ideas of architecture for court houses prevailed at that time. When the building had been put up ready for the roof, in stead of putting on the roof in the ordinary way, another partial \u2014 wooden \u2014 story was added, with ends jutting out over the main building, these ends being supported by stone pillars. This was sup posed to add greatly to the architectural beauty of the building. The pillars, and the part resting on them, were wholly and entirely useless \u2014 not probably even answering the purpose for which they were designed, that of architectural finish. The pillars in the case of the Newark court house were on the east and west ends. This building was destroyed by fire in 1874; about the time it was desirable to have a new one. The present building was begun in 1876, and cost, with furniture, about one hundred and ninety"], [288, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 28o thousand dollars. It was fire-proof except the upper portion. In March, 1879, the upper part caught fire, probably from a defective flue from the heat ing apparatus, and was destroyed ; burning down to the second story, where the fire was extinguished. In this fire the records in the offices of the recorder and auditor suffered greatly by fire and water. The part destroyed was rebuilt at a cost of forty or fifty thousand dollars. It is a beautiful structure, and looks as if it might stand the ravages of time a few centuries.

The first jail has been mentioned in the early history of the town. It stood on the south side of the public square, and Adam Hatfield, one of the first mail carriers, was probably the first jailor. The second jail was erected on a lot immediately in rear of the Park house, on East Main street. It was a square brick building, two stories in height, and very homely in appearance. About 1840 it was abandoned for the present building, which stands on Canal street, south side, between First and Second. It is a brick, two-story building, about thirty by forty feet in size, with a one-story wing on the east side, occupied by the jailor. Among the public buildings may, perhaps, be considered the old market-house, which stood facing the square, directly in West Main street where it enters the square. It was erected about 1827 or r828, and stood upon posts, the lower part being occupied for a market, and the upper part as a place of public worship, and for other public gatherings. Some of the early schools were also taught here. It was used until the pres ent one, corner of Fourth and Main, was erected, in 1839 or 1840. One of the most important public buildings in the county is the infirmary, located in Union town ship, eight miles from Newark, and about three miles south of Granville. The first Licking county poor-house, consisting of a hewn log building, was erected nearly upon the site of the present one, December 13, 1838, the first superin tendent being Trueman B. French, and the first inmate admitted, Samuel Thrall, of Granville township. In 1862, the old log structure was cleared off and a brick building substituted, form ing one portion of the present main building. Since the first, the farm has also been extended, and now consists of two hundred and twenty-six acres, nearly an acre of which is built over. Mr. William Beaumont, the efficient superintendent, comes from Alexandria, and took the office Febru ary 2, 1880. The main building is one hundred by forty feet, two stories and a basement, though showing three stories to the public road. On the first floor is the superintendent's office, a dining room for the female inmates, excellent kitchens, society."], [289, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 28l cellars, drying and ironing rooms. On the second floor are the superintendent's sleeping apartments; the male patients' dining room, capable of seating sixty persons; spacious sitting rooms for men; a tailoring and clothing department ; a dispensary, suitably appointed for the visiting physician, Dr. S. S. Richards, from Kirkersville ; the superinten dent's private office, and a suitable meeting room for the infirmary directors. The whole of the third story is devoted to sleeping apartments. The hospital and infirmary building is a sub stantial brick, two stories and a basement, eighty by sixty feet, and is occupied in part by children, who have their own separate dining room and sleeping apartments. The \"idiot ward\" is also in this building. Around these two structures clus ter some fifteen or twenty smaller buildings, occu pied as shoe shop, bake house, wash house, store house, slaughter house, winter and spring milk houses, smoke house, ice house, wood house, hog houses, stables, barns, etc. Neat flower and veg etable gardens are attached, and are skilfully tilled. The farm consists of two hundred and twenty acres under a high state of cultivation, having yielded this year eight hundred and five bushels of wheat, eight hundred bushels of corn, seventy tons of hay, two thousand bushels of po tatoes, besides pasturing and feeding twenty-two cows, four horses and fifty hogs. There are two orchatds, one quite young; the yield of fruit is satisfactory. The directors are James Miller, of Newark, elected in 1879; S. C. Williams, of Pat askala, elected in 1877; and R. D. Horton, of St. Louisville, elected in 1878. The project of establishing a \"Home for the Friendless\" in the county has been inaugurated, and it is believed will soon be pushed to comple tion. It entered into the mind of Mr. Lucius Humphrey, one of the philanthropic citizens of the county, to signalize the close of his life by generously donating a tract of ten acres of land, situated within the corporate limits of Columbus, to this noble purpose. The liberal donor of the munificent gift selected Judges Buckingham and Follett and Hon. Isaac Smucker as trustees to carry his benevolent purpose into effect, who promptly accepted the trust and entered into the possession of the property. In pursuance of the provisions of the trust deed and of law, a board of trustees, composed of Messrs. Enoch Wilson, David Winegarner and John H. Franklin, has been appointed by the court, who have organized to execute the trust. The land has been conveyed to the county commissioners, who will proceed to sell it and apply the proceeds to the establishment and perpetuation of a children's home, as provided for by Mr. Humphrey, under the direction and su perintendence of the recently appointed board of trustees."], [290, "CHAPTER XXXV.

Honorable W. D.

From the title page of his history of the Pan Handle coun ties of West Virginia, it appears that he had asso ciated with him Messrs. G. G. Nichols and A. G. Sprankle. The work is very large, consisting of nearly five hundred large pages, is well got up, and its production involved a large amount of labor. Pamphleteers. \u2014 Near the close of Rev. Thomas D. Baird's ministry in the First Presbyte rian church, of Newark, which terminated in 1820, he wrote a pamphlet of a somewhat controversial nature on the subject of church music, maintain ing the right and the propriety of the members of the congregation, but who were not in communion with the church, but were of good moral character, to not only participate therein, but to lead in it if they had inclination and capacities fitting them for the positions. Hon. Jacob Winter wrote a pamphlet of seven pages, double columns, entitled \"A History of the Disciple Churches in Licking County, Ohio.\" It appeared as No. 4, in the series of pioneer pam phlets issued by the Licking County Pioneer His torical and Antiquarian society, and was published in 1870.

Mr. Park is a native of Union township, and spent forty years of his life within its limits, but at the time of writing the foregoing pamphlets, was a resi dent of Marshall, Illinois. The pamphlets were printed in Terre Haute, Indiana. Captain Joseph M. Scott wrote a pamphlet of eleven double column pages, with the title \"Our Early Times \u2014 Historical sketch of St. Albans"], [297, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 289 Township.\" It was published in Newark (Clark &: King, printers), in 1873, and is No. 8 of the pio neer series. It was first read at a pioneer meeting held in Alexandria, and its publication requested. Rev William Bower is the author of a pamphlet with the following title: \"Sermon preached in the First Presbyterian church, Newark, Ohio, Sunday, September 19, 1875, in memory of the Rev. Henry Martyn Hervey, late pastor of said church, by Rev. William Bower.\" It is a pamphlet of twenty five pages, and was printed in Granville.

One of his earliest in point of time, was published anonymously in Columbus, Ohio, its title being \"An appeal to Liquor Makers \u2014 Liquor Venders \u2014 and Liquor Drinkers.\" It was a pamphlet of sixteen pages. Another of his pamphlets was entitled \"History of the Welsh Settlements in Licking County, Ohio \u2014 the Characteristics of our Welsh Pioneers \u2014 their Church History, with Biographical Sketches of our Leading Welshmen; Read at the Licking County Pioneer Meeting, April 7, 1869.\" It was a twenty two page, double column pamphlet, and is No. 2 of the pioneer series. Still another of Mr. Smucker's pamphlets gives \"An account of the celebration of American In dependence, at Clay Lick, by the Licking County Pioneers, together with an address by Dr. Coulter, on early times in the Clay Lick Settlements ; Also Historical Sketches of the Townships of Licking, Bowling Green, Franklin, and Hopewell.\" This is a pamphlet of thirty-six double column pages, bear ing the imprint of Clark & King, Newark, Ohio, and is No. 3 in the pioneer series. Mr. Smucker is also the author of pioneer pamphlet No. 7, entitled, \"Our Pioneers: Being Biographical Sketches of Captain Elias Hughes, John Ratliff, Benjamin Green, Richard Pitzer, John VanBuskirk, Isaac and John Stadden, and Captain Samuel Elliott, with Brief Notices of the Pioneers of 1801 and 1802; Also a Paper on the Pioneer Women of the West, by Rev. Mrs. C. Springer; Concluding with a Poem, entitled, The Pioneers of Licking, by A. B. Clark, Esq.\" This is a pamphlet of thirty-three pages, double col umns, printed in 1872 by Clark and King, New ark, Ohio. This prolific pamphleteer is likewise the author of \"Licking County's Gallant Soldiers, who died in Defence of our Glorious Union and of Hu man Freedom.\" It is a pamphlet of twenty eight pages, and was prepared for and published by the Licking County Soldiers' Monumental association ; Clark & Underwood, printers. Isaac Smucker was also the author of the \"Cen tennial History of Licking County, Ohio,\" which is a pamphlet of eighty pages. Small editions of four pamphlets by the same author were circulated, the matter appearing orig inally in the report of the Ohio secretary of state for the years i?>-]6- -]-]-\u25a0]?, and '79. Their titles were as follows: \"A Brief History of the Terri tory Northwest of the River Ohio ;\" \"Ohio's Pre historic Races and Pre-territorial History ;\"\" His tory of our Moravian Missions, and Memorial Sketches of our Missionaries;\" \"Ohio Pioneer History \u2014 Cresap and Logan, Crawford's Cam paign, and a Brief Biographical Sketch of Captain Cresap, Logan and Colonel Crawford.\" The first named was a pamphlet of twenty-five pages, the second of thirty-four pages, the next of thirty-two pages, and the fourth of twenty-four pages. It may be observed also that Mr. Smucker was the writer of the historical matter, to the extent of twen pages, contained in the neat and well-gotten up pamphlet entitled, \"Premium List and Regulations for the Thirty-third Annual Fair of the Licking County Agricultural Society, held on the Fair Grounds in 1880,\" and which is transferred to this volume.

Licking County as an Ancient Battle Ground\u2014 Military Works of the Mound-Builders \u2014 Soldiers of the Revolution Who Settled in the County\u2014 Troubles With the Indians\u2014 The War of 1812 and its Sur- viving Veterans\u2014 The Mexican War and a List of the Survivors. of the Survivors. TF a battle has ever been fought within the \u00b1 limits of Licking county, the fact is unknown to modern chroniclers; hence its military history will not embrace a picture of armed hosts in deadly conflict upon its soil, but must tell of her sons who went forth at the call of their country when im periled, first, by an Indian foe; second, by the arrogance of Britain; third, by the aggressions of the Spanish race in the land of the Aztecs; and, lastly, by the power of a slave oligarchy, in an attempt to sever the union of the States. Notwithstanding the absence of written records to sustain the belief of battles and sieges in Lick ing county, the silent monuments that are every where spread before our wondering eyes throughout the county \u2014 like the everlasting rocks that point the geologist to the past history of the globe \u2014 here present analogous marks, and a base for reasoning into the objects and designs of a great labyrinth of earthworks left by pre-historic man. That a people more advanced in civilization, and more numerous than the Indian aborigines found here by our pioneers, once inhabited Licking county, hardly admits of a doubt. Whence they came and whither they went remains a mystery, but their monuments are left to tell us, not only of religious ceremonies and athletic sports, but of the art of war and the strategy of defence. The well preserved mounds in the Cherry valley mark plainly the fact of religious and defensive works combined \u2014 one to defend the other, and the nu merous mounds found upon high hills warrant the assumption of a line of signal stations to warn the inhabitants of the valleys of an approaching foe. Can it be that these people, becoming very numerous, living in affluence upon the golden riches of the soil, vain in their superiority of know ledge, bigoted in their religious superstitions, effeminate and weakened in long security, have met the same fate as declining Rome, when bar barians of athletic proportions and warlike prowess swept down from the north, laying vandal hands upon accumulations of art gathered in past cen turies? The people were almost annihilated, per haps a remnant driven off far to the south; their works, all that could be destroyed, were destroyed, and the country allowed to grow up again in its primitive wildness, furnishing hunting grounds for the American Indian, who delights in savage life and the excitement of the chase. They in turn are now driven out, and the power ful Anglo-Saxon lays claim to the domain, giving to us Licking county of 1880, with her well-tilled farms, her cities and towns, her railroads and tele graphs, her schools and churches. We can imagine, notwithstanding the absence of written records, that Licking county in the past has been truly a great battle-ground, wherein a numerous people struggled for the defence of their firesides, and at last yielded to a race superior in warlike prowess. But it is with the written record we have to deal in these pages, which will cover the Indian wars, the War of 181 2, the Mexican war, and the war of the great Rebellion, wherein Licking county contributed her full share in the glory and success which followed the American arms. The Revolution had ended before the first per- r5T"], [300, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 292 manent settlement was made in Ohio, hence there were no contributions from this territory to the ranks of the patriots of those days. Many Re volutionary soldiers, however, emigrated to Lick ing county, and went earnestly at work to conquer the wilderness as they had conquered a political independence for the enjoyment of future genera tions. Can one imagine a grander work for the good of mankind than was accomplished by the sacrifices of these men? After a struggle of seven years with a powerful nation, impoverished and poor, ex cepting in the glad consciousness of having given to America independence and liberty, they turned their faces westward to build up an empire that is now a marvel in the eyes of the whole world. A wilderness of savage Indians and wild animals were conquered to make way for grain fields, gardens, cities and towns all now connected in a labyrinth of steel rails for transportation and electric wires for the communication of intelligence. Would that these pages could present in letters of gold the names of the Revolutionary patriots who contributed so much to make Licking county what it is, but it has been impossible to procure a full list ! Among the number may be mentioned : Thomas Seymour, who was born in Virginia in 1756. He came to Licking county in 1803, and settled in Madison township. He died in 1831, aged seventy-five years. John Larabee settled in Madison township about the year 1801, and died February 6, 1846, aged eighty-six years. John Edwards came from Brooke county, Vir ginia, and settled in the South Fork valley in Sept ember, 1 80 1. He was engaged as a spy for some years, on the frontiers of Virginia. Jonathan Benjamin settled on Ramp creek in the spring of 1802. He had passed through the old French and Indian wars, and also through the Revolution. He died in 184T at the advanced age of one hundred and three years. Evan Humphry settled in Newton township about the year 1805. He served in the Revolu tionary war, and was one of the \"forlorn hope\" at the storming of Stony Point in 1779, by General Wayne. Zachariah Albaugh was a Revolutionary soldier, and settled in Newton township. He died No vember 9, 1859, over a hundred years of age. Benjamin Green came from Maryland, and settled in Madison township in 1800. He died in 1835, aged seventy-six years. Captain Archibald Wilson received a commis sion as a lieutenant of militia of the county of Dunmore, Virginia, issued by the committee of safety for the colony of Virginia, dated at Williams burgh, January 20, 1776. He had previously \u2014 in 1774 \u2014 served in Lord Dunmore's expedition. In 1777 he was appointed captain, and served in this rank until the close of the war. His principal ser vice was in keeping the Tories in check in Virginia. Benjamin Wilson served as a lieutenant on Lord Dunmore's staff in 1774, in his expedition into the Northwest Territory, and as captain, early in the Revolution, mostly on the frontier against the Indians. He received a commission as colonel in 1781. Judge James Taylor, who was born in Pennsyl vania in 1753, was a soldier in the Revolutionary war. He was in the Williamson expedition against the Moravian Indians, and was one of seventeen who voted against the murder of the captives. Judge Taykrdied in 1844, aged ninety-one years Judge Timothy Rose served as an officer in the Revolution, and distinguished himself in the storming of a British redoubt at the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown. Captain Samuel Elliott, who settled in Licking county as early as 1800, was a Revolutionary sol dier. He died in 1831 at the age of eighty years. Of the Indian war but little can be said, as the first settlement in Licking county was made after the Greenville treaty, and our pioneers were not molested by the savages of the forest within the limits of the county. During the war of 181 2, however, when the British and the Indians com bined for the subjugation of the Northwest Terri tory, many of Licking county's hardy pioneers marched away to the north and took part in the operations of the army about Detroit early in the war. The Indians had nearly all disappeared at the time of the settlement of the county. Occasion ally a stray red man made his appearance, as a \"tramp\" would now-a-days, asking for food and"], [301, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 293 shelter and looking sadly at the encroachments of the whites upon his wild hunting grounds \u2014 per haps lingering near some hallowed spot where his fathers had been laid away, consecrated in his voy age to the happy hunting grounds. Previous to the year 1800 there were several Indian villages within the present limits of Lick ing county. One near Johnstown, called Raccoon town. One on the Bowling Green, five miles east of Newark, and a temporary village on the Shaw nee run. The Shawnee, Delaware and Wyandot tribes occupied the territory now embracing Licking county, and relinquished their claims by the treaty of Fort Mclntosh, in the year 1785. One night in April, 1800, two Indians stole the horses of Hughes and Ratliff from a little en closure near their cabins. Missing them in the morning, they started off, well armed, in pursuit, accompanied by a man named Bland. They fol lowed the trail in a northern direction all day, and at night camped in the woods. At the grey of morning, they came upon the Indians, who were asleep and unconscious of danger. Concealing themselves behind the trees, they waited until the Indians awakened, and were commencing prepara tions for their journey. They drew their rifles to shoot, and just at that moment one of the Indians discovered them, and instinctively clapping his hand on his breast, as if to ward off the fated blow, exclaimed in tones of affright: \"Me bad Indian, me no do so more!\" The appeal was in vain; the smoke curled from the glistening barrels, the re- port rang in the morning air, and the poor Indians fell dead. They returned to their cabins with the horses and \"plunder\" taken from the Indians, and swore mutual secrecy for this violation of law. Hughes had been bred in the hot-bed of Indian warfare; the Indians having murdered a young woman to whom he was attached, and subse- quently his father. The return of peace did not mitigate his hatred of the race. One evening, some time after, Hughes was quietly sitting in his cabin, when he was startled by the entrance of two powerful and well-armed savages. His wife stepped aside and privately sent for Ratliff, whose cabin was near. Presently Ratliff, who had made a detour, entered with his rifle in an opposite direction, as if he had been hunting. He found Hughes talking with the In dians about the murder. Hughes had his toma hawk and knife in his belt, but he dare not reach for his rifle that hung from the cabin wall. There all the long night sat the parties mutually fear ing each other, but neither summoning courage to stir. When morning dawned the Indians left, shaking hands and bidding farewell, but in their retreat were cautious not to be shot in ambush by the hardy borderers. Hughes died near Utica, in March, 1845, at an advanced age, and was buried with military honors. His early life had been one of much adventure; he was, it is supposed, the last survivor of the bloody battle of Point Pleasant. Henry Smith, the father of Esquire David Smith, of Madison township, was formerly a resi dent of Virginia. He lived for several years at Kanawha, and participated in several frontier ad ventures. He was with Major McCollough at the siege of Fort Wheeling, and there fought against the Indians. He emigrated to Licking county in 1804, and died in 1845. John Van Buskirk, who settled in Licking county in 1800, served many years as a spy be tween the Ohio and Tuscarawas rivers for the pro tection of the frontier settlements. The War of 181 2. \u2014 Licking county was rapidly filling up with settlers from the eastern States when war was declared against Great Britain in T812, and the young men were called upon to drop their axes and go forth to protect the fron tiers against the wily savage and his British master. As sparsely settled as was Licking county that day, she contributed at least four companies under the leadership of Captains Rose, Davidson, Sut ton and Spencer, marching away to the northwest. There was also a company of cavalry recruited by Captain Bradley Buckingham, but he did not go out with it. First Lieutenant Jehu Sutton com manded the company during its active service. The hostile position of the Indians and the grow ing difficulties with Great Britain, led Governor Meigs, of Ohio, to enroll three regiments of volun teers to rendezvous at Dayton, in the spring of 181 2. Lewis Cass was chosen colonel of the third regiment, and he was joined by the Licking 9"], [302, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 294 wrote a letter to the governor speaking of his per sonal dislike to Munson, but said for the good of the service, he recommended his promotion. It is related that one of the Munsons, at the sur render, was asked by the British general the use made of the large drum carried by the Yankee boys, when Munson replied \u2014 \"that is a bass drum, you d d old fool.\" Captain Simeon Wright settled in St. Albans township in 1816. He was the son of Simeon Wright, sr., who fought under Stark at Bennington, and Ethan Allen at Ticonderoga. Captain Wright belonged to the Thirtieth United States infantry, and took part in several engagements in the war of 181 2. For a time he was in General Wade Hampton's command, and accompanied the expe dition to Montreal. He was the ranking officer in Fort Brown during the siege of Plattsburgh, where, after two days fighting, General Macomb repulsed the British under Provost. He had command at the mouth of Otter creek, repulsing the British fleet in its attempt to burn our shipping at that point. In the spring of 1813, with eight men, he captured two hundred stand of arms that had been distributed among the Canadian militia near Mon treal. Captain Wright, in person, took as prisoner of war, Captain McGilvery of the British army, while scouting on the Canada line, in 18 14. He was under General Wilkinson at the battle of La cole Mill, where, with sixty men, he defended an important field-piece with a loss of twenty killed and wounded. For this heroic and skillful service he was brevetted a major. Major Wright met with an accidental death in this county in 1833. Archibald Wilson, jr., was an officer in the war of 1 81 2, and served on General Gaine's staff. He was a brother of Enoch Wilson of Newark. Captain John Spencer raised a company in Lick ing county for the war of 1812. He was surren dered by Hull at Detroit, and thus became a pa roled prisoner of war. This would have been a sufficient excuse for Captain Spencer to have remained at home, but when the northwest frontier was menaced in 1813, his patriotism led him to recruit another company, which he led north to join the forces of General Harrison. He devel oped a high order of patriotism, bravery, and soldier-like qualities during the war, and in civil county volunteers at Findlay. The route was through the almost trackless wilderness and swamps of the northwest. The troops reached Detroit in July; war with Great Britain having meanwhile been declared. On Tuly nth they crossed into Canada, Colonel Cass claiming the honor of being the first man, who, in the war of 1812, stepped in arms upon British soil. He also commanded, in a skirmish on the seventeenth, in which the first blood was shed; the British being driven from a bridge across Aux Canarde river. The Licking volunteers were included in the surrender of General Hull; and Colonel Cass was so stung with mortification, it is said, that he would not deliver his sword, but broke the blade and threw it away. The Ohio troops were dis missed on their parole not to serve again until they were exchanged. Colonel Cass was exchanged in January, 1813, and about the same time was com missioned as a colonel in the regular army. Hull's surrender occurred on the sixteenth day of August, 18 1 2, and, as stated before, the Ohio troops having been paroled, they returned to their homes as best they could. Of those who were conspicuous from Licking county, in this war, may be mentioned: Major Jeremiah R. Munson, who was elected major of Colonel Lewis Cass' Third Ohio regiment. He was a man of fine soldierly bearing and attain ments. He was surrendered with the army under Hull, at Detroit, but afterwards entered the service. While near Detroit he was accidentally shot by David Messenger, and so severely wounded that he barely survived the journey home. There existed among the officers of the Third regiment an ill-feeling towards Colonel Cass, by reason of an imaginary or real belief in his partial ity, or his disposition to court favors from the government authorities, to the detriment of the officers of the regiment. Major Munson shared this dislike with his brother officers, and there ex isted a coolness between the major and the col onel during their term of service, but it can be said to the credit of Colonel Cass, and as evidence of the appreciated worth of Major Munson, that when Cass was solicited by Governor Meigs to recommend some worthy officers for promotion, he"], [303, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 295 life commanded the highest esteem and confidence of his fellow citizens, in evidence of which, he was placed in some military or civil position during most of the period of his life in Licking county. Of the survivors of that war who now reside in Licking county the writer has been unable to pro cure a full list. Among the number, however, may be mentioned \u2014 Peter L. Dean, who resides in Newark, and is the father of Major A. J. Dean. He enlisted in Captain Joel Harrison's rifle company of New Jersey militia, September i, 1814, and was dis charged November 9th of the same year. John Wolever, of Granville township, enlisted September 5, 1814, in Captain F. Donleavy's com pany of Colonel Freelingheysen's New Jersey militia, and was discharged in December the same year. George W. Loar now lives in the southeastern part of the county, and is eighty-seven years of age. He went out from Muskingum county in the war of 1 81 2, and enlisted April 15, 18 13, in Cap tain Joseph Karns' company A, Colonel James Paul's Twenty-seventh regiment. The regiment marched to Seneca and there built a fort; thence they marched to Lower Sandusky. He was eight days with Perry on the lakes, and was in the ibattle of the Thames. After wintering at Detroit he was discharged April 15, 1814. Jacob Bush, who resides in Newark, at the advanced age of ninety-four years, enlisted at Lancaster, Ohio, in Lieutenant Collins' de tachment, and was assigned to Captain C. A. Trimble's company, of the Nineteenth United States infantry. He marched via Franklinton, Newark and Upper Sandusky to Lower Sandusky, and afterwards to Buffalo, where he joined General Scott's army. He was engaged in the battles of Lundy's Lane and Chippewa Lake, and was wounded in the former battle. He took part in the siege of Erie for thirty-seven days, and was discharged at that place February 18, 181 5. Mr. Bush came to Newark about the year 1825, and drove coach for Willard Warner for many years. David Messenger, who now resides at Utica, at an advanced age, volunteered in 18 12 with Cap tain John Spencer, and went out from Licking county to join Colonel Cass' regiment. They marched to the Maumee rapids, and thence to Detroit, where he was included in Hull's surren der. He was in no general engagement, but in several skirmishes with the enemy. John Wagy, who now resides near Kirkersville, at the advanced age of ninety-one years, went out in the war of 1812 in Captain Peter Lamb's com pany, and served under General Harrison. He acted as teamster upon one occasion and hauled cannon balls two days. The Wyandot Indians were friendly toward the United States at that time, and acted in conjunction with the Govern ment forces. They were called the \"pet\" Indians by the soldiers. Mr. Wagy has a vivid recollection of the early days in Licking county. He settled on Licking creek, in Harrison township, in 181 5, and visited Newark when it contained but five or six houses, one of which, used as a hotel, stood near the present court house square, and had flung to the breeze on the corner of the building an old muslin sign, inscribed thereon the brief but pointed word, \"Inn.\" He first saw the \"old fort\" in 1815, and says that it has changed but little in its appearance since that year. The old settlers in those days rode on horseback to Zanesville to mill; but they deny emphatically the charge of carrying a large stone in one end of the bag to balance the grist. Mr. Wagy reared a family of fifteen children, eight boys and seven girls, and is now living in that ripe old age, fruitful in its past with events covering sixty-five years of the coun ty's history. Abram P. Westbrook, the oldest veteran of the War of 18 1 2, died in Newark, October 10, 1880. One of the city papers gives this obituary notice : The decease of probably the most aged man in Licking county occurred at his residence on Granville street, in Newark, on Sunday, tenth inst. , after a protracted illness of several months. Mr. Abram P. Westbrook, the subject of this brief sketch, was a native of Luzerne county, Pennsylvania, and was born Sep tember 2, 1778, making him, at the time of his death, one hun dred and two years one month and eight days old. He was a soldier in the war of 1812, being at the time a resident of Vir ginia. Mr. Westbrook lived many years in Zanesville, and lived forty-one years in Newark. He came here in 1839, and has lived a quiet, upright life, sustaining a good reputation for industry and integrity. Mr. Westbrook was a member of the Methodist church most of his life. He was unobtrusive, unpre tentious in his intercourse with his fellow men, and had acquired a good degree of intelligence and infoimation. His wife died meny years ago, but a number of his children survive him.

The company was stationed at Camargo for some five months, then ordered to garrison Marin, where, in connection with Captain Mickum's com pany, of Columbus, and Captain Julian's, of Lan caster stood the siege of General Urea, February 23d to the 25th, 1847, with eighteen hundred lancers, also with the regiment in the fight at San Francisco, February 26, 1847, then took up the line of forced march and reported to General Tay lor, at Ague Nueva, beyond the defile of Augos tena, then back to Beuna Vista, and joined the command of General Wool and encamped on the battle ground of Beuna Vista until the seventeenth of May, 1847, when the regiment was ordered to report at New Orleans for muster out \u2014 which dated June 23, 1847. In the campaign, two died of disease, Robert Wilkins and Harvey Courson \u2014 two wounded at San Francisco \u2014 John Colvin and Jackson King, and one taken prisoner \u2014 Patrick McLaughlin. The second company was enlisted by Captain John R. Duncan, as cavalry, in May, 1847, with David A. B. Moore, as first lieutenant, Will iam P. Morrison as second lieutenant and Ben jamin Wilson as third lieutenant. They were known as \"Duncan's Mounted Rangers,\" one of sev eral independent companies organized at that time in the State. They numbered one hundred men besides the officers, and nearly every member fur nished his own horse. The company left Newark with considerable enthusiasm, on the twenty seventh of May, 1847, riding all the way to Cin cinnati. Here they went aboard the steamer \"Star Spangled Banner,\" and in the latter part of June arrived in New Orleans. They spent about a week in this city, and celebrated the Fourth of July, and then boarded the steamer \"Mary Kings land\" and proceeded by the gulf of Mexico to the mouth of the Rio Grande, thence to Carmargo, and were stationed the whole of their term of service at Seralvo, on the Rio Grande route, doing escort and guard duty, and, on several occasions, while bearing the mail and dispatches, under escort, in detachments, had sharp passes with rov ing bands of guerillas. This company was funeral services were conducted by Rev. E. I. Jones, of the Congregational chureh, on Tuesday, twelfth instant, and many friends followed the remains to Cedar Hill cemetery. Stephen C. Smith, a native of New Jersey, served as adjutant in Colonel Cass' regiment in the war of 1 8 1 2. He represented Licking county in the State legislature in 1826-27. Samuel Bancroft, who was born in Massachusetts, in 1778, and died in 1870, was also a soldier in the war of 1812. Of those whose ashes repose in our cemeteries may be mentioned James Smith, Jacob Little, Alexander Cochran, Moses Moore, Fred Salliday, David Moore, William Home, James Taylor, John Henry, Amos Halliday, Jacob Overturf, S. G. Hamilton, sr., William Francis, James McCadden, Meredith Darlington, Isaac Conrad, and Jesse Smith. The descendants of these patriots now residing in Licking county point with pride to the achieve ments of their fathers, who took such a creditable part in the establishment of the \"second indepen dence of America,\" and, in the language of \"Loss ing:\" \"The events of that war did secure the far more important advantage of the positive and permanent independence of the United States, for which our people, with arms and diplomacy, had contended for many years in vain.

Isaac Vanatta, now well known in Newark, was accidentally wounded at Walnut Springs, near Monterey, in December, 1847. While Vanatta and \"Gus\" Stewart were watering their horses in the spring Stewart's carbine was accidentally dis charged, and the ball and buck-shot entered Va natta's shoulder, causing a very dangerous wound, which confined him in the hospital for six weeks and reduced his weight from two hundred to one hundred and twenty-five pounds. He now draws a pension from the general government on account of his disability. The third company was recruited in August, 1847, by Captain Richard Stadden, with Andrew J. Spencer as first lieutenant, Hugh W. Morehead as second lieutenant, and Andrew J. Bartley as third lieutenant. It was mustered in at Camp Wool, near Cincinnati, and made company B, of the Fifth Ohio volunteer infantry, aud operated on the Vera Cruz route. The company was stationed at Puebla the most of its term of service, and was mustered out at Cincinnati in October, 1848. Private Palmer, of Jacksontown, died on the Gulf, and John Stasel and Jacob Veach were delegated by the officers to encase him in a United States blanket, and with proper ceremony he was deposited in the Gulf of Mexico. Those known to be living at this date, October 7, 1880, of the first company are as follows: COMMISSIONED OFFICER. Lieutenant James H. Smith, Newark, Ohio. NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS. Sergeant Edwin Williams, Homer, Ohio. Sergeant Richard Parr, Danville, Iowa. Corporal Jacob H. Scott, Newark, Ohio. PRIVATES. George Downs, Newark, Ohio. Manly McMullin, Utica, Ohio.

McMullen. Major David A. B. Moore. Lieutenant William R. Morrison. John L. Smith. John A. Vance. Thomas Wiley. The survivors point with satisfaction to the splendid acquisition of territory which was among the results of the termination of that war. The immense mineral resources of the Rocky mount ains and Pacific States, which since then have been discovered and developed, have added untold wealth to the Republic; and although during that war fears were entertained that the acquisition of territory would largely increase the slave power in the country, we now behold the whole vast ex panse consigned forever to the labor of the free man."], [306, "CHAPTER XXXVIII.

In the language of an able writer of that day: \"The cannon which bombarded Sumter awoke strange echoes, and touched forgotten chords in the American heart. American loyalty leaped into instant life and stood radiant and ready for the fierce encounter. From one end of the land to the other \u2014 in the crowded streets of cities and in the solitude of the country, wherever the splendor of the stars and stripes, the glittering emblems of our country's glory, meets the eye came forth shouts of devotion and pledges of aid, which give sure guarantees for the perpetuity of American freedom.' \" Licking county shared this outburst of loyalty, and party lines for the time were swept aside. Her people arose above all sectional differences, and the language of Reid, in his admirable history of \"Ohio in the War,\" will apply to the people of Licking county : \"They counted their sons and sent them forth. They fol lowed them to the camps. They saw them waste in inaction and die of disease. Then they saw them led by incompetents to needless slaughter. Stricken with anguish, they still main tained their unshaken purpose. They numbered the people again and sent out fresh thousands. They followed them with generous gifts. They cared for the stricken families, and made desolate lives beautiful with the sweet charities of a gracious Christianity. They infused a religious zeal into the contest. They held their soldiers to be soldiers in a holy war; they truly believed that through battle and siege and reverse, God was waiting in His own good time to give them the victory. They saw the struggle broadening in its purposes as in its theater. They did not shrink while unseen hands were guiding them to ends they knew not of. After a season the war came very near to each one of them. Almost every family had in it one dead for the holy cause; by almost every hearthstone rose lamenta tion and the sound of weeping for those that were not.\" The duty of the historian, however, would fall short of its accomplishment did not he reveal, im partially and with candor, the fact that, notwith standing the first outburst of patriotism, a large portion of the people of Licking county grew faint THE events of this great war have passed into history. The youthful student in our public schools, born since its close, is bewildered with the recital of its gigantic proportions. The son listens with wonderment at the tale of bloody strife, from the lips of the surviving father. The mother nar rates the anguish and long years of anxiety suffered in those dark days. All are familiar, through written records and word of mouth, with the causes which led to that strife, its fierce continu ance, its glorious termination, and the fruits left for the enjoyment of coming generations. The causes of the war are briefly stated as fol lows by Ridpath, in his common school history: ' ' The most general cause of the civil war in the United States was the different construction put upon the constitution by the people of the North and the South. One party held that the union of the States is indissoluble ; that the States are sub ordinate to the central government ; that the acts of Congress are binding on the States, and that all attempts at nullification and disunion are disloyal and treasonable. The other party held that the national constitution is a compact between sover eign States; that for certain reasons the union can be dissolved; that the sovereignty of the nation belongs to the individual States; that a State may annul an act of Congress; that the highest allegiance of the citizen is due to his own State, and that nullification and disunion are justifiable and honorable. \"A second cause of the war was the different system of labor in the north and the south. In the north, laborers were freemen; in the south they were slaves. In the south the the ory was that capital should own labor; in the north that both capital and labor were free. The north hated slavery; the south fostered it.\" This difference of opinion led to the formation of two great political parties. There was a diver sity of opinion in the north, as well as in the country at large; but when the south took desper ate and active measures to dissolve the Union, all"], [307, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 299 of heart when actual warfare stared them in the face, and withdrew the sympathy and encourage ment that had followed their sons to the field. A larger portion blindly heeded the dictation of par tisan leaders, and allowed party fealty to warp their earlier convictions of duty to their country. Many were outspoken in their opposition to the govern ment in its efforts to suppress the Rebellion. They discouraged enlistments, encouraged desertions, and in their general bearing seemed cast down by Union victories, and correspondently elated by Union de feats. But when the final victory crowned the Union arms, and the supremacy of the Government was completely established, these men acquiesced in the general result, glad that the war was over and that their wavering and unstable convictions, all torn up by conflicting partisan elements during four long years, could now settle into that peaceful calm so acceptable to all citizens. The federal enrollment of men in Licking county, subject to military duty for the years 1863 and 1864 was four thousand eight hundred and eighty. She furnished three thousand one hundred and sixty volunteers, who were mustered into the service of the United States for duty outside the State, besides the most of three hundred and sixty eight men who were drafted, and four hundred and four, men who served within the State, in the de fence of Cincinnati, making a grand total of three thousand nine hundred and thirty-two, being over eighty per cent, of the whole number of her inhab itants capable of bearing arms, and making an army of soldiers greater than that of Washington when he crossed the Delaware. The numbers may be briefly stated in tabular form as follows: tween the Ohio river and the Gulf of Mexico, and from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic. Licking county's participation in that war was eloquently pictured in the oration of Judge Samuel M. Hunter, delivered on decoration day, 1880, at Cedar Hill cemetery. He said: \"How well do we remember when Captain McDougal's com pany of the old Third Ohio, the first gift of Licking county to the Union, marched down Third street that chill April day, nineteen years ago ! Sumter had been fired upon, and the rebel lion had been inaugurated. Who does not remember the solemn faces and streaming eyes of the people, as that little column filed down the street to take their place in the army of the Union? I see before me to-day faces and forms who were in that devoted band. It was they who were plunging into the great unknown ; it was they who enlisted under the banner of a nation which had long been unused to war. They were the first, \u2014 but they were quickly followed by the other companies and regiments, which marched down the same street, and took their places in the army of the Union, \u2014 some to the east, some to the west, but all with their faces to the south, and their homes behind them. \"There were boyish faces and forms in those ranks; but the years roll on, and those who were boys then, are men of middle age now. They were leaving family, friends and comforts. Their one thought was of home \u2014 their one impulse to battle for. and save the Union. And so the long months and years of that dark time went by. Call on call was made for fresh sacrifices, and fresh lives to offer up upon the altar of our country. The young lads who watched McDougal's company march away, grew up and themselves took their places in the army of the Union ; until ere the war was over, Licking county herself had placed a small army in the field. ' ' And wherever the soldiers of Licking county have marched, wherever they have camped, and wherever they have fought, her sons have been in the foremost line of battle, their arms have held up the flag of the Union the highest, and their names to-day are inscribed among the brightest on their country's roll of honor. Her sons have fought, and their blood has been poured out on nearly a hundred battle-fields, from the Potomac to the Rio Grande. And in all that struggle, this county has never been called upon to blush for their honor, nor to share in their dishonor. Her sons have felt the scorching fires of Ma nasses; they joined in the wild cry of victory at Fort Donel son; they helped win and wear the laurels at the siege of Vicksburgh, they stood the brunt of battle under the low spread ing branches of the forest of Shiloh ; they fought among the clouds at Lookout Mountain ; they pined and wasted in the prisons of the South ; their blood has dampened the soil all. over Virginia, and with Sherman, they \" marched down to the sea.\" And when her ragged and decimated companies and regiments came back to her, their honor was only second to the honor of those who left their bones on the field where they fell.\" In the following pages a brief historical sketch of the companies that were wholly recruited in the county is given, together with a copy of the or iginal muster-in rolls. Volunteers in 1861 ..... 1307 Volunteers in 1862 ..... 970 Recruits to the close of the war . . . 392 National guards, one hundred days' service . 491 Drafted men in 1862 ..... 361 Drafted men in 1864 .... 7 \"Squirrel Hunters,\" defence of Cincinnati . . 404 Total 3932 Many natives of Licking county enlisted in other counties and in other States who are not embraced in the above estimates.

When, the war broke out the Newark Wide awakes almost to a man enlisted in the service of their country, and marched away under their gal lant leader \u2014 Captain McDougal. It was a notice able coincidence that the officers of the Wide awakes became the officers of old company H of the Third Ohio volunteers, the first of Licking county's spontaneous and generous contributions to the grand army of the Union. Upon one occasion the citizens gave a supper and ball in honor of the Wide-awakes. Captain McDougal was called upon for a speech, and his only response was that he could not make a speech, but he knew how to command a company of Wide-awakes. Future events proved his quali fications as a commander when he led the boys through the fiery ordeal at Perryville, and gave his own life blood in defence of his country. Company H, Third Ohio Infantry. \u2014 This was the first company organized in Licking county for the war of the Rebellion and its ranks were speedily filled in response to the first call of the President for volunteers. The people of Newark well remember the wild excitement created in our streets when the dread news came of the first shot fired upon our flag at Sumter. Patriotism arose to fever heat ; the young men quickly enrolled their names and prepared to march speedily away to the defence of their coun try; the beating of drums on the public square was heard day after day, and name after name was inscribed upon Licking's first muster roll. The company was recruited by Captain Leon idas McDougal. Leroy S. Bell was commissioned first lieutenant and Frank P. Dale second lieuten ant. It was mustered in the service of the United States with the Third Ohio infantry for three months service, on the twenty-seventh of April, 1 86 1, and went into camp, first at Columbus, and afterwards at Camp Dennison, near Cincinnati, where it drilled constantly during the month of May. Before orders were received for the field its three months term of enlistment had expired, and the men enthusiastically re-enlisted for three years. The regiment was re-organized on the twelfth day The history of the companies must necessarily be the same as that of the military career of the regiments to which they were attached, and the writer has largely drawn from the admirable ac counts given of Ohio regiments in the book entitled \"Ohio in the War.\" The copies of the muster rolls are taken from those on file in the adjutant general's office in Co lumbus. There may be clerical errors in the copy as well as in the original, which will be readily de tected by those readers who are amiliar with the names and dates of enrollment. The additions of recruits and the casualties are not given, as it would be impossible to do so within the limits of this work. Following the list of companies mention is made of the detachments and recruits that went into other organizations, also other matters of interest pertaining to the military history and present mili tary spirit of the county. It will not be out of place to mention here the valuable services rendered by the \"Military Com mittee of Licking county\" \u2014 Joseph White, Michael Morath, Colonel Andrew Legg, Dr. John N. Wil son, and Noah Wilkins. The successful progress of enlistments, the care of the sick and wounded at home and in hospital, and the aid given to soldiers' families are largely due to the energy, capacity, and patriotism of these gentlemen. Too much cannot be said to the praise of the noble women of Licking county in their patriotic and Christian work for the cause. They forwarded great supplies of sanitary goods to the camps and hospitals in the field, and they soothed the sorrows of the widows and orphans at home. Wide-awake Company. \u2014 During the excitement of the presidential campaign of 1860 semi-military organizations were formed all over the country, bear ing the name of \"Wide-awakes.\" A Wide-awake company was organized in Newark, composed of young men enthused with the wide-spread presenti ment of a coming storm and a determination to maintain with the sword the result of the ballot. The company was commanded by Captain Leonidas McDougal, and met for drill in the upper story of the building on Third street, lately occupied by the American printing establishment. The members"], [309, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. of June, and soon after was armed and equipped for the field. On the twentieth it was ordered to Grafton, Virginia, then the seat of war, and on the twenty-second crossed the Ohio river in time to claim the honor of being the first three years' regi ment to leave the State. The regiment reported to General McClellan at Grafton and was assigned to General Schleich's brigade, consisting of the Fourth and Ninth Ohio infantry and Loomis' Mich igan battery. It soon proceeded to Clarksburgh, where camp equipage was supplied and prepa rations made for an active campaign. From Clarksburgh it advanced with the army to Buckhannon, Virginia, and was at Rich Mountain in July. It continued to operate in West Virginia through the summer and fall months, having fre quent skirmishes with the enemy. In October Captain McDougal in command of two companies scouted the country as far as Mar shall, the rebels having deserted their camps at Big Springs. At this time the first campaign of the company ended; a campaign of peculiar hardships to the new soldier, filled as it was with hard marches through the mud, amid pelting rain storms severe drilling and some fighting. In November the regiment moved down the Ohio river to Louis ville and encamped near the city. It was here assigned to General O. H. Mitchell's division of the army of the Ohio. In December it marched for Elizabethtown, Kentucky, and went into winter quarters at Bacon creek, or Camp Jefferson, as it was styled. In February, 1862, the regiment broke camp and marched over roads deep with mire through Bowling Green, and were the first troops to reach the vicinity of Nashville after the surrender of Fort Donelson. From Nashville the Third Ohio moved southward with General Mitchell's column and participated in the brilliant campaign which resulted in the capture of Murfreesborough, the occupation of Shelbyville and other Tennessee towns. It also took part in the sudden descent of the Union troops into the heart of the south in the vicinity of Huntsville and Decatur. At Bridge port the regiment charged under the impetuous Mitchell, and drove the enemy across the bridge. During the summer of 1862, Company H. passed a season of comparative inactivity. Hunts- ville was the rendezvous of the regiment, from which point detachments were sent out on scout ing and foraging duty. In August company H., with its regiment, joined in the race northward after Bragg. The march to Louisville was one of extreme severity; the weather was hot; thick, stifling dust covered the roads; the water courses were dried up, and the soldiers endured peculiar hardships and privations. The wary enemy evaded blows at every piont. Murfreesborough, Nashville and Bowling Green were passed, and on the twenty-fifth of Septem ber the old Third Ohio again entered Louisville. After a few days' rest the army again moved south ward until the bloody battle ground was reached. Here the Third Ohio bore a conspicuous part. In the beginning of the action it took position in an open field on the right of the Perrysville road. The rebel attack was fierce and deadly, but not withstanding its exposure the Third stood its ground, and returned volley for volley until over one-third its number had fallen dead or wounded. It was here that the gallant Captain McDougal fell, facing the foe, and Company H lost a loved and brave commander. Captain Leonidas Mc- Dougal was the son of Stephen McDougal, esq., an old resident of Newark, and the brother of Mrs. Luke K. Warner. His memory will ever be cherished by warm friends in Newark, who will always remember his admirable traits of character, his generous and chivalrous impulses, and his in tense patriotism which led him to take the first step and lead the first band of volunteers from Licking county in that memorable war. His re mains were brought from the battle-field, and interred in Cedar Hill cemetery. After the battle of Perryville the regiment moved in pursuit of Bragg as far as Crab Orchard, Kentucky, and then once more marched to Nashville. The battle of Stone River followed late in De cember, in which the Third Ohio bore a conspicuous part, losing heavily in the overwhelming tide of battle on the first day. On the second day it was posted on the extreme left, and at the last of the battle advanced in a double quick movement, cap turing the rebel line of works with many prisoners. The regiment rested in camp until April, 1863,"], [310, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. when it was detached to take part in the celebrated raid into Alabama, under Colonel Streight. The command was mostly mounted, and penetrated into the heart of the confederacy. It destroyed immense stores and munitions of war, but was so close pressed by overwhelming numbers that most of the command was finally captured near Rome, Georgia, but not until it had fought desperately with severe loss. The men were taken to Belle Isle and Libby Prison near Richmond, where they suffered all the horrors of prison life until May, 1863. The men were paroled, but the officers, includ ing the chaplain and surgeons, were retained and incarcerated in Libby Prison. Here the daring Colonel Streight made his escape, and after many days and nights of wandering found his way into the Union lines. After its exchange the Third Ohio performed duty in Ohio in quelling disloyal uprisings at home. It also entered in the pursuit of John Morgan. In August, it was ordered to Nashville, and served in Tennessee and northern Georgia until the expiration of its term of service. The officers of the Third Ohio being retained in prison, no effort was made to re-enlist the regiment as vet erans, therefore at the end of its first three years' term, June 23, 1864, the men were mustered out. However, many of its members re-enlisted in other regiments, and served gallantly to the close of the war. Nineteen men of company H, during its term of service, laid down their lives in defence of the country. Sixteen of the number now rest in Cedar Hill cemetery, who died during and since the war.

It moved to Camp Dennison and was mustered into the service for three years, on the twenty-eighth of June, 1 86 1. The regiment left Camp Dennison July 6th, and reached the seat of war on the four teenth. The battle of Scary Creek was fought on the seventeenth of July, with a loss of five killed and thirty wounded in the regiment. In a few days the regiment entered Charleston, West Vir ginia, and from that place it moved to Gauley bridge. On the thirteenth of August, eight companies marched to Camp Piatt, thence to Clarksburgh, West Virginia, and were assigned to General Ben ham's brigade. They then proceeded southward engaging in numerous skirmishes, but finally join ing the other two companies on the sixteenth of October. After several attempts to engage in bat tle, the Twelfth was transfered to General Cox's brigade, December 10th, and went into winter quarters at Charleston. On the third of May, 1862, the company left Charleston and joined Scammon's brigade. It was ordered to the army of the Potomac August 15th, and arrived at Alexandria on the twenty- fourth. In the meantime, Captain Legg had re- signed, June 20, 1862. The regiment met the enemy at Bull Run bridge, August 27th, and was defeated with a loss of nine killed and sixty-eight wounded. On the seventh of September, the company advanced into Maryland, and on the fourteenth it engaged in the battle of South Moun- tain, taking part in three bayonet charges, and with the regiment captured three battle flags, a large number of small arms and over two hundred prisoners, with a loss of sixteen killed and ninety- one wounded. On the seventeenth, the Twelfth was engaged at Antietam with a considerable loss. After the battle it marched for West Virginia, via Hagerstown and Hancock, Maryland, but on arriving at Hancock it moved into Pennsylvania to work against Stewart's cavalry. Stewart having retreated, the Twelfth returned to Hancock and arrived at Clarksburgh, West Virginia, October 16th. On the fourth of December the company marched to Fayette Court House, West Virginia, and went into winter quarters. Here it was assigned to the Second brigade, Third division, Eighth army corps. The brigade, under Colonel White, repulsed the ene- my's attack on Fayette Court House, May 19, 1863. The Twelfth marched against the enemy at Piney creek on the thirteenth of July, but the rebels re- treated and the regiment returned to Fayette Court House. On the seventeenth, the brigade was or- dered to Ohio to assist in capturing John Morgan, and after guarding fords for several days it returned to Fayette Court House. On the fourth of No- vember the Twelfth marched against Lewisburgh, but was unsuccessful. On the ninth of December, however, it made another move on Lewisburgh, as a diversion for General Averill, with a slight loss. The company left Fayette Court House on the third of May, T864, and marched to Cloyd's moun- tain, where it engaged in battle. The fight lasted over an hour, and the regiment lost eleven killed and sixty-eight wounded. Surgeon Graham and nineteen men, who were on the field taking care of the wounded, fell into the enemy's hands. The Twelfth marched northward, and on the nineteenth reached Blue Sulphur Springs. Remaining there a few days, it moved on to Staunton and joined"], [312, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 3\u00b04 the forces under Hunter. On the seventeenth of June the company went to Lynchburgh, and met the enemy in force a few miles from the city. The Twelfth and Ninety-first Ohio regiments charged the enemy and drove them back in disorder. The regiment captured a number of prisoners and lost eight killed and eleven wounded.

Company D, Twenty-second Ohio Volunteer Infantry. \u2014 Company D, of the Twenty -second Ohio infantry, was recruited in the western part of the county, by Captain Homer Thrall, and mustered into the service November 5, 1S61. It was as signed to a regiment raised for service in General Fremont's department in Missouri, and was first designated as the Thirteenth Missouri infantry, although officered by Ohio men, and its ranks filled up mostly by enlistments from the Buckeye State. However, on the seventh of July, 1862, the Secretary of War, recognizing the absurdity of designating the regiment by an erroneous title, issued an order transferring the Thirteenth Mis souri regiment to the State of Ohio, to be named the Twenty-second Ohio infantry. On the twenty sixth of January, 1862, the regiment was ordered to go to Cairo, Illinois, and report to Brigadier General Grant, then commanding that district. At Cairo it was met by orders to proceed to Smithland, Kentucky, and report to Colonel Lan- man, but on its arrival at Smithland orders came to make preparations to support a cavalry recon noissance then in progress toward Fort Henry. This was on the thirty-first of January. After reaching Fort Henry it was found that General Grant was in possession of that fort, and was busily engaged in preparing for an attack on Fort Donelson. The next move was to Clarksville, thence to Pittsburgh Landing, where the company arrived on the twentieth of March. The battle of Shiloh was commenced on the sixth of April, 1862, and lasted two days, during which time the regi- ment lost in killed and wounded eighty-nine offi- cers and men. The battle of Shiloh was succeeded by the advance on Corinth, which ended about the twenty-sixth of May, 1862. On the third of October rebel generals Price and Van Dorn attempted to take Corinth, but were defeated by Major General Rosecrans, then commanding the national forces. Nothing of im portance occurred until the twenty-ninth of May, 1863, when the regiment was ordered to move to Memphis, and on arriving there found prepara tions being made to move towards Vicksburgh. On the first of June the regiment embarked on transports for Haine's Bluff, on the Yazoo river. In that place it was engaged in throwing up earthworks until July 16th, when orders were re ceived to report at Helena, Arkansas. General Steele was at this point organizing the army of the Arkansas. The Twenty-second Ohio was made part of this organization, and left Helena for Lit tle Rock on the thirteenth of August, 1863. The company had remained in Little Rock a little over a month when orders were issued for the regiment to go to Brownsville, Arkansas, to assist in guard ing the railroad beteen Little Rock and Duvall's Bluff. Nearly one year was consumed in this duty, and during this time nothing of importance took place, with the exception of occasional pur suits after guerillas. In February, 1864, one hundred and five offi cers and men of the regiment re-enlisted as vet erans. On the twenty-sixth of October, 1864, the regi ment received orders to go to Camp Dennison, Ohio, at which place, on the eighteenth of No vember, it was mustered out of service, complet ing its term of three years. The company had lost twenty men in battle and hospital during its term of service. muster in roll of company d, twenty-second REGIMENT OHIO volunteer infantry.

Company C,Twenty-seventh Ohio Volunteer Infantry. \u2014 This company was recruited in the summer of 186 1 by Captain Edwin Nichols, and was mustered into the service in August. George B. Upham, of Newark, was commissioned first lieuten ant, and Jonathan Rees, of Newark, second lieu tenant. The first move was toward St. Louis, Missouri, near which city efforts were made to perfect the men in drill and discipline. In September the regiment moved, by steamer, to St. Charles, and thence to Mexico, Missouri. Soon after this, orders were received to march to the relief of Colonel Mulligan, at Lexington. In October the company joined General Fre mont; then moving on Springfield; but General Hunter appeared on the scene of action, so the regiment was ordered to Sedalia. In February, 1862, the regiment proceeded to St. Louis, where it arrived, after a severe march, on the twentieth, and the next day it moved down the river and landed at Commerce. In the organization of the army of the Missis sippi, the Twenty-seventh was assigned to the First brigade, First division. In March the army moved upon New Madrid, the Twenty-Seventh being in the advance. After a successful battle, the regiment proceeded to Pitts burgh Landing, and moved on Corinth, forming the left of Halleck's army. This was about the first of May, 1862. Fuller's brigade, or as it was often called, the Ohio brigade, had occupied Iuka, but in Septem-"], [315, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 3\u00b07 on the twenty-eighth of May, and lost heavily, both officers and men. On the twenty-second of July, before Atlanta, the regiment fought one of its most severe battles. Two miles southeast of Atlanta, near where they fell, rest the heroes of the Twenty seventh who were killed upon that field. In Au gust the regiment was sent to Marietta, where it re mained until the fall of Atlanta. The regiment pursued Hood northward, and, after returning, marched with Sherman to the sea, skirmishing near Savannah with slight loss. At Cheraw, South Carolina, the Twenty-seventh was the first regiment to enter the town, skirmish ing with the rebel cavalry. The regiment then moved toward Washington, and in July, 1865, was ordered to Camp Dennison, when the members re ceived their final payment and discharge. Com pany C had lost ten men in the service, and many more were disabled by wounds received in battle. Lieutenant George B. Upham died in Missouri early in the war, and his loss was deeply deplored by his comrades in arms as well as by many warm friends at home. Captain Nichols was promoted to major and lieutenant colonel before the close of the war, and Lieutenant Rees was promoted to a captaincy. William E.

But they had scarcely reached Corinth when General Price attacked the small force left at Iuka, and took possession of the place. The Ohio brigade was a part of the force sent to re-capture the town, which it reached on the nineteenth of September. In a short time it returned to Corinth, and encamped near the town. Van Dorn made a vigorous attack on the Ohio brigade, but was repulsed. In this en gagement the regiment lost about sixty men. After returning to Corinth the regiment received two hundred recruits \u2014 a very timely addition, as the Twenty-seventh was much reduced in number. On the first of November, the Ohio brigade marched toward Grand Junction to join Grant's army, and with that army marched to Oxford, Mississippi. The brigade was afterward ordered to Jackson, Tennessee, to assist in driving back the rebels. After considerable marching, the bri gade encountered Forrest at Parker's cross-roads, and took an active part in the engagement at that place. The regiment was attached to General Dodge's command and moved eastward with him through Iuka and Tuscumbia valley. The Ohio brigade was ordered to Memphis, and remained some time in that place performing garrison duty. In October, 1863, the brigade left Memphis and moved to Iuka. In the march from Iuka the Twenty-seventh was in the advance brigade, and moved from eighteen to twenty miles per day, and encamped at night a short distance in advance of the main column. General Dodge finally halted at Pulaski, but the Ohio brigade marched about fifteen miles south of that place. Here the troops were employed in building bridges and fortifica tions. When this work was about completed, the Twenty-seventh re-enlisted as veterans and were furloughed to their homes. Soon after their return to the field, the Ohio brigade marched against Decatur and captured it. While at Decatur the Ohio brigade was discontinued, and the Twenty seventh and Thirty-ninth Ohio, Sixty-fourth Illinois, and Eighteenth Missouri constituted the First bri gade of the Fourth division, Sixteenth army corps. On the first of May, 1864, the Fourth division moved from Decatur and joined the main army at Chattanooga. The regiment was engaged with Hood's corps"], [316, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 3\u00b0\u00a7 MalenderB. Steadman, July 18, 1861. Oscar Sheppard, July 18, 1861. Thomas Spellman, July 18, 1861.

On the twenty-seventh of September, with the regi ment, it received marching orders and reported to Brigadier General O. M. Mitchell, at Cincinnati. The regiment moved on to Camp Dick Robinson, Kentucky, October 2d, and there went through with a regular course of drill, which rendered it more efficient. The company remained here until the twelfth of December, when it moved to Somer set, and on the nineteenth of January, 1862, it marched to the assistance of General Thomas at the battle of Mill Springs, but, on account of bad roads, it arrived too late to take part in the engage ment. Here the regiment was assigned to the First brigade, First division, Army of the Ohio. Preparations were made to follow the retreating rebels, but the plans were changed, and the troops moved to Louisville. The regiment embarked on the steamer Magnolia, and proceeded down the Ohio and up the Cumberland, landing at Nash ville. Owing to the inconveniences to which the men were subjected, much sickness ensued, so that on disembarking less than one-half were fit for duty. After a short rest, however, the health of the men improved greatly, and the regiment moved southward with Buell's army. The regiment ad vanced with the army toward Corinth, and during the march was engaged frequently in skirmishing with the rebels. After the evacuation of the city it marched in pursuit of the rebels about forty miles, and then returned and went into camp near Corinth. On the twenty-second of June the regi ment marched toward Iuka, and on the twenty sixth continued the march toward Tuscumbia. Here the fourth of July was celebrated.

The regiment was divided into detachments, and two companies were sent to Decatur, and one company was sent to Trinity. On the nineteenth the brigade marched for Huntsville by way of Decatur, arriving at the latter place on the twenty second. After the brigade had crossed the Ten nessee river a messenger arrived with the informa tion that the detachment at Trinity had been attacked by a large force of mounted rebels. The rebels were repulsed, but one-half of the detach ment was killed or wounded. The regiment moved with the army to Huntsville, and thence to Dech erd, Tennessee. At the battle of Perryville the regiment was under fire, but was not actively en gaged. After the battle the march was continued to Nashville, and from this point the army moved toward Murfreesborough. In the battle of Stone River the Thirty-first acquitted itself nobly. On the twenty-third of June, 1863, the regiment started on the Tullahoma campaign. On the twenty-sixth it was engaged at Hoover's Gap, where, in connection with the Seventeenth Ohio, it carried a position defended by two rebel brigades. The regiment took part in the battle at Chickamauga, and suffered severely. The next engagement was at Brown's Ferry. About this time the regiment re-enlisted and received a furlough for thirty days. After returning to the field, with an increase in number, the regiment marched on the Atlanta campaign. On the fourteenth of May, 1864, it was engagad in an assault upon the enemy's line in front of Resaca, and lost heavily. After the fall of Atlanta the regiment marched in pursuit of Hood, but the chase was soon abandoned. The Thirty-first moved with Sherman's army toward the sea, leaving Atlanta on the sixteenth of November. Nothing of importance occurred until the works around Savannah were reached. After the surren der of the city the regiment remained in camp until the twentieth of February, 1865, when it moved on the campaign of the Carolinas. After this the regiment moved to Washington city and participated in the grand review. It was then transferred to Louisville, Kentucky, where it was mustered out on the twentieth of July, 1865. Captain Putnam resigned on the first of Febru ary, 1863. John H. McCune and Eli Wilkins, of 10 Newark, were promoted to captains and com manded the company during its most brilliant ca reer. Captain McCune was on staff duty most of the time and was eminently qualified for that branch of the service. Samuel S. Southard, of New ark, was promoted to first lieutenant and served to the close of the war. Anson B. White and Charles Babbitt, two Newark boys, also held commissions as second lieutenants. The company lost, during its term of service, thirty-one men in battle and hospital. FIRST MUSTER IN ROLL OF COMPANY C, THIRTY- FIRST OHIO VOLUNTEER INFANTRY. COMMISSIONED OFFICERS. Captain John H.

On Saturday, April 5th, companies B and K were on picket. During the night the enemy was feeling the Federal lines, and at daylight his col umns were seen deploying in the distance. At sunrise a rebel cavalry officer rode up within thirty yards of the picket line; checking his horse with apparent composure, inquired: \"Are these Union pickets?\" He was told they were, and or dered to halt, but turning his horse rode for the woods, when the unerring rifle of Sergeant Glenn sped a ball through the officer's brain. Before the sun had set on that day Sergeant Glenn also lay stark and stiff on the bloody field. The Forty-sixth Ohio stood the impetuous charge of the rebel hosts on that bright Sunday morning, and met with a loss of two hundred and eighty killed and wounded. The regiment remained upon the battle-field until the twenty-seventh of April, when it moved with the army upon Corinth. In November the regiment started on a cam paign through the interior of Mississippi, under General Grant. In June, 1863, the Forty-sixth participated in the siege of Vicksburgh. On the fourth of July, after the surrender, the regiment moved toward Jackson, and in the evening halted in the vicinity of Big Black river. Companies E and K were ordered forward to the ford at Birdsong's ferry, but they had been there only a short time when it was discovered that the enemy was on the opposite bank. After several days fighting, the enemy was forced to evacuate the city, and the regiment returned to Big Black and went into camp. On the tenth of October, the regiment, with the Fifteenth corps, under General Sherman, embarked for Memphis, and from there it marched to the re lief of Chattanooga. At the battle of Mission Ridge the regiment was engaged, with a heavy loss in killed and wounded.

Crow, and was mustered in with the regiment on the six teenth of October, 1861. It left Camp Chase for the field February 18, 1862, and was attached to General Sherman's division at Paducah, Ken tucky. The Forty-sixth was one of the advance regiments up the Tennessee to the famous battle-"], [319, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 3\" Resaca, where it was actively engaged for three days, but with slight loss. The regiment then moved on to Dallas. On the twenty-seventh of May the rebels made an attack on our forces, but were repulsed. In the battle ' of New Hope Church, which occurred about the first of June, the Forty-sixth formed a conspicuous part, the ene my being defeated. On the ninth of June, the brigade accompanied General Garrard's cavalry to the vicinity of Kenesaw, at which place severe skirmishing was engaged in, with considerable loss on both sides. The regiment arrived in the vicin ity of Atlanta on the evening of the twentieth, and at that place was engaged in skirmishing until the twenty-second. At Ezra church the regiment was again engaged. On the third of August the brig ade took up an advanced position, and the Forty sixth, with details from other regiments, was ordered to drive in or to capture the enemy's out posts. The contest was severe, but it resulted in the capture of about one hundred prisoners. From this time the regiment was constantly engaged in fighting until the twenty-sixth, when it took part in Sherman's flank movement to Jonesborough. On the second of September, the regiment was again engaged, and captured the enemy's fortified skirmish line. The regiment followed Hardee's retreating army and halted near Lovejoy's station. A hand-to-hand conflict followed, but finally the enemy was forced to retire, and the Forty-sixth captured about fifty prisoners. The regiment par ticipated in the campaign against Hood in Georgia and Alabama, and returned to Atlanta on the fifth of November. It next proceeded to Savannah. Nothing extraordinary occurred until in the vicin ity of Griswoldsville, when the brigade was ordered to move toward Macon. The advance soon came upon General Kilpatrick, who was engaging Wheel er's cavalry. An infantry skirmish line soon dis persed the cavalry and the brigade moved on. On the tenth of January, 1865, the regiment embarked on a steamer for Beaufort, South Carolina. On the twenty-seventh, it marched to Bentonville, thence to Raleigh, when the news of the surrender of Lee's army was received, and shortly after, at the same point, General Johnston surrendered to General Sherman. The regiment then proceeded to Louisville, Kentucky, where it was paid off and mustered out on the twenty-second of July, 1865. This regiment was famous for its righting quali ties during the war, and under the leadership of the gallant Colonel Walcutt made a record, during its term of service, that will adorn the brightest pages of history. Captain Crow resigned early in the war, and the company was commanded by other officers during its active service. The records show a loss of killed among the Licking volunteers in this company of four men, but the loss must have been greater, considering the many engagements in which it participated.

HISTORY OF THE WAR CONTINUED. \"Dixie Land\" had turned against the flag they had sworn to support. Charles R. Woods realized this as the accepted time to act in the defence of his country. He called upon the young men of his native county to follow him to the field. A local pride favored the project of organizing a county regi ment. It was sometimes called a \"family regi ment.\" Two brothers were made colonel and lieutenant colonel; a brother-in-law was made ma jor, and another brother-in-law made adjutant. The venerable Ezekiel S. Woods was called the \"Father of the Regiment.\" The adopted children in this grand old regiment soon learned in the field to honor, obey and respect the heads of the famity. The Seventy-sixth regiment Ohio volunteer in fantry was organized for three years' service, in THIS regiment was familiarly known as the \"Licking County Regiment.\" In the field it was poetically termed the \"Licking Volunteers;\" earn ing its title from the fact that it never turned its back to the foe, and all through its long and event ful service fortunately shared with the winning side many of the grandest victories of the war. The war had assumed such gigantic proportions when the President called for \"five hundred thousand more,\" it became evident that Licking county must yield more of her sons, not in squads, not in com panies, but a regiment of men must go forth to attest her patriotism and fidelity to the Union.

William Beaumont, commissioned a second lieutenant January 17, 1862, resigned February 7, 1862, not having the required number of recruits. Charles R. Woods, captain in the Ninth United States infantry, was detached from the regular army, appointed colonel October 7, 1861, and placed in command of the Forty-fourth regiment Ohio in fantry October 12, i86r. He served about one month in western Virginia, and returned to Camp Sherman, Ohio, to complete the organization of the Seventy-sixth Regiment. William B. Woods was commissioned lieutenant colonel November 4, 1861, and commenced the work of organizing and drilling the new regiment at Camp Sherman. Willard Warner was commissioned major of the regiment December 28, 1861. Charles R. Pierce was appointed surgeon Janu ary 9, T862, and Thomas B. Hood, assistant sur geon November 6, 1861. Henry D. Wright, appointed first lieutenant in Seventy-fifth regiment Ohio volunteer infantry, Sep tember 18, 1 86 1, was transferred to the seventy sixth regiment and appointed quartermaster Octo ber 14, 1861. Jerome N. Rappleyea was discharged from the Ninth United States infantry and commissioned first lieutenant November 25, 1861, and appointed adjutant of the Seventy-sixth regiment December 24, 1861. Rev. John W. McCarty was appointed chaplain of the regiment December 16, 1861. During the organization of the regiment the men were daily drilled in squad, company and battalion drill, and in the duties of the sentinel and soldier. Through the military knowledge and experience of Colonel Woods, and the efficiency and energy of Lieutenant Colonel Woods, both officers and men made rapid advancement. The men were first armed with the French musket, which was after- ward exchanged for the Springfield rifled musket. The regiment left Newark for the field on the ninth of February, 1862, and within six days was in line of battle, at Fort Donelson. Here it did effective service. At a critical moment when the enemy attempted to break our lines, the officers and men behaved gallantly under the first fire. On the sixth of April the regiment made a forced march from Adamsville \u2014 where it occupied a posi tion on the right of General Grant's army, in Wal lace's division \u2014 to the battle-field of Shiloh. On the seventh it participated in that sanguinary en gagement from early morn until the enemy were in full retreat at night. During the siege at Corinth the regiment occupied a position in the grand re serve and performed good service. On one occa sion it made a gallant charge and drove a rebel outpost from its position. After the evacuation of Corinth the regiment moved to Memphis, thence by river to Helena, where it joined General Curtis' army of the southwest. In August, 1862, it formed part of an expedition down the river to Vicksburgh, under the command of Colonel Woods, and sur prised the Thirty-first Louisiana regiment at Milli ken's Bend, capturing its camp with forty prisoners. It also captured Haine's Bluff, on the Yazoo river, taking four siege guns, two field pieces, and a large amount of ammunition. The rebel steamer Fair play, with six thousand stand of new arms, was also captured by the expedition under Colonel Woods. In October the regiment moved from Helena to St. Genevieve, Missouri, and thence to Pilot Knob, where the health of the men was re cuperated. The loss up to this time, by disease and death, had been heavy. In December the Seventy-sixth formed a part of General Sherman's expedition against Vicksburgh, being assigned to Hovey's brigade, of Steele's division, and it partic ipated in that disastrous attack at Chickasaw Bayou. The depression among the men occasioned by this failure was soon dissipated by the glorious victory at Arkansas Post in January, 1863, where the Seventy-sixth bore a conspicuous part. In the charge on the enemy's rifle-pits at that place, the officers and men of the regiment behaved most gallantly, holding their ground against the concen trated fire of three rebel regiments and two pieces of artillery, and not being properly supported, the"], [323, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 3iS regiment only held its ground at the point of the bayonet. The brave Captain Thaddeus Lemert fell here, together with many gallant men. In February, 1863, the Ohio legislature passed a joint resolution tendering thanks to the Seventy-sixth regiment, with others, for gallantry and good con duct at the capture of Arkansas Post. The regiment again moved down the Mississippi river to Young's point, and joined Grant's army in its operations about Vicksburgh, working vigorous ly on the canal across the isthmus. In April it took part in the expedition down Deer creek, and routed the enemy under Colonel Ferguson, return ing to the river with large supplies of forage, horses, and mules. In May the Seventy-sixth moved with the Fifteenth corps, commanded by General Sherman, around to the rear of Vicks burgh, skirmished at Fourteen Mile creek, and struck Jackson, the capital of Mississippi, on the fifteenth of May. Here it performed quick and effective work in destroying the railroad and bridge across Pearl river. From thence, with rapid marches, the army closed around the doomed city of Vicksburgh, the Seventy-sixth occupying a posi tion on the extreme right, next the river. For forty-six days it skirmished and besieged, burrowed and mined through the intricate approaches to that stronghold, and at last rejoiced in the victory on Independence Day, when oui flag was proudly flung out over that last barrier to the Gulf. But the pleasures of a release from protracted siege operations were not to be long enjoyed ; anticipa tions of rest and quiet in camp were cast aside to face the stern duty in the field. The sun that set on that glorious day of victory, rose to find the regiment faced about and tramping through dust and heat towards the rebel chieftain Johnson, who had hung on our rear. Rapid strides and hard knocks drove him into the capital \u2014 Jackson \u2014 and a steady hammering drove him thence and scattered his forces towards the center of the confederacy. The commercial gateway to the gulf was now open; then followed rest to the army until Septem ber, when, breaking camp at Black river, it moved to another field yet contested \u2014 that of Rosecrans', in Tennessee. The regiment moved by river to Memphis, thence by land through Tennessee and northern Georgia, in time to join Hooker in his memorable fight above the clouds. Lookout Moun tain swept at its summit, Mission Ridge was next in the path of the victorious army, and again the flag fluttered in triumph there, gathering a perfect har vest of prisoners in its wake. The high pitch of an imus wrought by these victories impelled the men to intrepid daring. At Ringgold, on the twenty seventh of November, they scaled the rocky face of Taylor's Ridge, in the face of a scathing fire in front and flank, but the Seventy-sixth faltered not until led by Lieutenant Colonel Warner to the crest of the \"hill. But many brave men had fallen, \u2014 the gallant Captain French, Lieutenant Wall, Lieutenant Miller, and Lieutenant Lemert \u2014 fell facing the foe ; Lieutenant Metzgar and Captain Blackburn were wounded. Seven men were shot down in succession while carrying the flag. Cap tain Wherle lost sixteen men out of twenty in his company. It has been said that General Grant remonstrated with Hooker for sending men against such odds, and Hooker replied; \"Those Ohio boys were too impetuous to hold back.\" The Seventy-sixth was temporarily in Hooker's com mand at this time. In January, 1864, the regi ment went into winter quarters at Paint Rock, Ala bama, and soon after re-enlisted as veterans, and proceeded to Ohio on veteran furlough. Many hearts fluttered with pride among that great con course of people who beheld that column of com panies march down the main street of Newark \u2014 three hundred war-bronzed veterans in all of the nine hundred that marched away two short years before. The mass soon lost its cohesive qualities in that circle of friends \u2014 dissolved and drifted to the old firesides again, where a long time the acant space had held sway; but there were many absent ones who would never return until the last bugle reveille called them to an eternal abode, where war is known no more. The regiment re turned to its camp at Paint Rock in March. In May it broke camp again and marched to Chatta nooga, and entered into General Sherman's Atlanta campaign. On the fourteenth it charged the rebel .works at Resaca, and held the position until the evacuation; thence moved with the army, and, at Dallas, on the twenty-eighth, repulsed a desperate charge of the enemy. Here the regiment reserved its fire until the enemy approached within a few"], [324, "316 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. yards, when it opened a deadly volley of musketry, driving back the rebel columns with fearful loss. In June it moved forward and occupied a posi tion in the front line at Kenesaw Mountain, where, on the twenty-second, its skirmishers took part in the disastrous charge of that day. When the rebels again evacuated, the regiment moved through Marietta, crossed the Chattahoochie river, and pushed up within four miles of Atlanta. On the twenty-second of July, when Hood swept round the flank and rear of McPherson, the Seventy-sixth occupied a position on the extreme right, with the division commanded by General Charles R. Woods. The rebel columns poured through a gap to the left, in full view, and pushed back the Union troops of a brigade that held the works on the crest of the hill, capturing a four-gun twenty-pound Parrot battery. It was at this critical moment that General Woods was ordered to pass his division to the left and charge the victorious rebel lines, and retake the lost works and guns. The enemy formed on the reverse side of the works, and awaited the attack of General Woods. Without faltering the line of blue swept grandly up the hill slope, under a galling fire, nor stopped until its colors were planted and the enemy hurled back. The battery was retaken and the works secured, when quickly the division turned again to occupy the old position and prevent a flank movement; the rebel line had about as quickly formed, and, pushing parallel with General Woods, delivered a volley when on the move; a return volley sent them reeling back \u2014 the old po sition was secured and the battle was over. Lieu tenant Steffa, a gallant young officer of the regi ment, was killed during this movement. Lieuten ant Arnold, in Captain Miller's company was very severely wounded. The regiment moved the next morning to the left, and again made a night march to the extreme right, to the west of Atlanta. Here on the twenty eighth, the enemy attacked the whole line of the Fifteenth corps, and was repulsed with fearful loss. The Seventy-sixth occupied an important position in an angel of the line, and with fixed bayonets withstood the brunt of the attack for four hours. One thousand of the rebel dead were found in front of the Fifteenth corps. Siege oper- ations were then continued until the twenty-fifth of August, when the regiment took part in the grand flank movement to the south which resulted in the capture of Atlanta. It struck the Montgomery railroad, and twisted its track for miles, then marched across Flint river and faced the enemy at Jonesborough. On the thirty-first the rebels charg ed the lines and were repulsed,\u2014 the Seventy-sixth meeting them in open field. After the evacuation of Jonesborough, the regiment followed the enemy to Lovejoy station, where the campaign ended, and on the eighth of September it went into camp at East point. When Hood moved north and threat ened Sherman's line of communications, the Seven ty-sixth moved with the corps through Resaca and Snake Creek gap, and skirmished with the enemy at Ship's gap. Here, on the sixteenth of October, it captured two companies of a South Carolina regiment, and this practically ended its participa tion in the battles of the West. The Seventy-sixth marched with Serman to the sea, she men enjoying a continuous picnic all the way. When Savannah was taken it performed provost guard duty in the city until the ninth of January, 1865, when it started on the march through the Carolinas. It skirmished at Columbia and performed guard duty in that city four days. It participated in the last battle of the war, at Bentonville. After Johnson's surrender it marched through Richmond to Wash ington, and took part in the grand review, then moved to Louisville for muster out. The men were discharged at Columbus on the twenty-fourth of July, four hundred and thirty-three in number. This regiment participated in forty-four battles, moved nine thousand six hundred and twenty-five miles on foot, by rail and water, and passed through eleven rebellious States. Two hundred and forty one men were wounded in battle, three hundred and fifty-one died on the field and in hospital, two hundred and twenty-two carry scars as evidence of their struggle with the enemy, and two hundred and eighty-two yet carry the seeds of disease con tracted in the line of duty.

In a short time the regiment received marching orders, and proceeded to Lexington, Kentucky. On its arrival at that place rumors of a rebel advance via Cumberland Gap caused the transfer of about ten thousand troops to Richmond, Kentucky. On the twenty-ninth of August the brigade of General Manson, then five miles south of Rich mond, had an encounter with Kirby Smith's ad vance. They remained all night on the field, con fident of success; but it was not so decreed. Blind to danger and bold to rashness, our troops not only stood their ground, but advanced to meet certain defeat and almost certain death. The next morning the rebel army made an attack. After some skirmishing, our troops were driven headlong from their position. One hundred and twenty men of the Ninety-fifth, and a majority of the line offi cers, deeming themselves the only representatives of the State on the field, stood their ground until completely surrounded, when they were compelled to surrender. In this battle eight men were killed, forty seven wounded and six hundred captured. Among the wounded were Major Jefferson Brumback and Captain David Thomas, of Newark. The loss of the other regiments engaged was about two hun dred and fifty killed and eight hundred wounded. The regiment after being paroled was regularly ex changed in November, 1862, when it was re-organ ized and recruited to nearly its original strength. On the twenty-fifth of May, 1863, the regiment was ordered to Memphis, at which place a division was organized for service at Vicksburgh. It took part in the siege and assaults until a few days before the capture of the city. The Ninety-fifth aided in the capture of Jackson, Mississippi, and also in the operations around the Big Black river, where it captured a battery of four guns and sixty rebel gunners. After the fall of Jackson the Fifteenth corps, to which the Nine ty-fifth was attached, marched with General Sher man to the relief of Chattanooga. During the winter the Ninety-fifth was assigned to the Six teenth corps, with which it served until the end of the war. Early in June, 1864, an expedition, composed of three brigades of infantry, a division of cavalry and a strong force of artillery, under the command of General Sturgis, undertook to strike the Mobile & Ohio road near Tupelo. Memories of the Rich mond disaster yet lingered in the minds of the men, and it was with forebodings they pursued their march. They arrived at Guntown on the tenth of June, and at once engaged with the enemy, but were defeated. The regiment went into the fight with nineteen commissioned officers and three hundred muskes, and returned to Memphis with nine officers and about one hundred and fifty men. In July, the Ninety-fifth, in company with Major General A. J. Smith, again set out from Memphis for the purpose of retrieving the former disaster. The rebels under D. N. Lee and Forrest, attacked them, but were defeated with heavy loss. Owing to a rumored movement of General Price, a division \u2014 in which the Ninety-fifth served \u2014 was placed under command of General Mower,"], [336, "328 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. for operations in Arkansas. But on arriving at Little Rock it was found that Price had marched to Missouri. Mower pursued until Rosecrans turned back the head of the rebel column, and it fin illy disappeared in the wilds of Arkansas, The regiment then proceeded to Nashville, Ten nessee, where the enemy was encountered, and skirmishing was engaged in for several- days. The cloud that for two years rested on this regiment sailed away, and success was met with on every side. The regiment then joined General Canby's forces at New Orleans, where it arrived in March, 1865. Early in April the Ninety-fifth began a northward march. On the nineteenth of August, 1865, it was mustered out of the service. The rolls disclosed the fact that of one thousand and eighty-five officers and men composing this regiment, five hundred and twenty eight were killed in battle, or died of wounds or disease in the service.

After Longstreet was forced to retire, it returned to Chattanooga, and eight miles south of that place went into winter quarters. The Atlanta campaign opened May 7, 1S64. The One Hundred and Thirteenth took an active part in all the operations around Atlanta, and was almost always under fire. In the battle of Kenesaw, the regiment formed the first line of assault, and consequently lost heavily. After the fall of Atlanta the regiment was sent to Chattanooga; from that place it marched southward, and joined Sherman in his \"march to the sea.\" With one exception, the march of the One Hundred and Thirteenth was unbroken until it reached the defenses of Savan nah. After the evacuation of the city it camped on the Savannah river until a crossing was ef ected, when the One Hundred and Thirteenth found itself on South Carolina soil. The regiment was severely engaged at Benton ville, fighting hand-to-hand. After the surrender of Johnson it moved via Richmond, Virginia, to Washington city, then proceeded to Louisville, Kentucky, where it was mustered out on the sixth of July, 1865. Twenty-five Licking county boys lost their lives while serving in this company. Company F, One Hundred and Thirteenth Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry. \u2014 Cap tain ' Levi T Nichols, of Newark, and Lieu tenant Nelson Durant, of Hartford, recruited this company for the One Hundred and Thirteenth regiment, all from Licking county, excepting about twenty men who were enlisted in Franklin. The career of this company is almost a repetition of that of company D in the same regiment. Cap tain Nichols served until the close of the war. Lieutenant Durant, after being promoted to a captaincy, was honorably discharged in Novem ber, 1864. The company lost seventeen men in the service, who were from Licking county.

First Lieutenant Frederick A. Eno, August 20. Second Lieutenant Charles Sinnet, August 20. On the twenty-seventh of December, company D, together with the regiment, was ordered to Louisville. The order was unexpected, as the or- ganization was incomplete; but in two hours after its reception the One Hundred and Thirteenth was on its way, finely equipped. On January 13, 1863, Captain Munson resigned his commission, and the command of the boys of company D devolved upon other officers during their term of service. The same month the regi- ment moved from Louisville to Mouldraugh's Hill, but returned again in a short time, and embarked for Nashville. The regiment then moved to Franklin, having been assigned to General C. C. Gilbert's division, and took part in several expedi- tions against the enemy. The command formed the right wing of the army of the Cumberland, and entered upon the Tullahoma campaign, but was not in an engage- ment. It participated in the Chattanooga cam- paign as a part of the reserve corps. The One Hundred and Thirteenth bore a dis- tinguished part in the battle of Chickamauga, be- ing brought into action on the second day, at a most critical point and moment. The loss was heavy in the regiment; being one hundred and thirty-eight officers and men out of three hundred and eighty-two that went into action. At the battle of Mission Ridge the division was detached from the Fourteenth corps, and formed a part of General Sherman's force. The regiment moved to the relief of Knoxville, and endured all the sufferings and trials of that campaign."], [338, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 33\u00b0 NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS.

One Hundred and Thirty-fifth Ohio Na. tional Guard. \u2014 Six companies, under command of Captains W. A. McKee, U, S, Westbrook, L. J. Johnson, John H. Baird, John L. Francis and Lieu- tenant John C. Hancock, were recruited in Licking county for this regiment, to serve one hundred days, and on the eleventh of May, 1 864, left for Cumber- land, Maryland, with the regiment eight hundred and fifty strong. They were soon ordered to Martins- burgh, & the companies were stationed along the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, with headquarters at Martinsburgh. On the morning of the third of July orders were received to abandon Martinsburgh, but the order failed to reach the companies at North Mountain; and after fighting five hours against three thousand rebels, with five pieces of ar- tillery, they surrendered. The men were taken to Andersonville, and the officers to Macon \u2014 after- ward to Columbia. Only about one half of those that were captured lived to return to their homes. Captain John L. Francis, of company F, died in prison at Columbia, South Carolina, December 4, 1864. The remainder of the regiment that es- caped capture moved in the direction of Maryland Heights and encamped near that place until the sixth of July, when it moved to John Brown's school-house and was engaged in skirmishing, with a loss of five killed, ten wounded, and twenty- seven missing. After this the regiment was engaged in guarding artillery on the heights, and remained on duty there until it was mustered out, which was on the first of September, 1864. During its short but eventful term of service the mortality of this regiment exceeded, with one ex- ception, that of any other band of men who went forth from Licking county. Eighty-eight men were lost on the field and in prison. Companies F and B alone lost seventy-two men, nearly all of whom were starved to death in the Andersonville prison pens. The survivors to-day are the sternest adhe rents to the cause for which their comrades died that can be found in our midst, and no political demagogy can swerve them from voting in the fut ure as they shot in the past. Of the field and staff officers in this regiment who went out from Licking county may be men tioned Andrew Legg, colonel; David Thomas, jr., major ; David H. Gregory, assistant surgeon ; and Charles T Dickinson, adjutant."], [340, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 332 Lewis C. Marsh, Mav 2. William T. O'Bannon, May 2. William O'Bannon, May 2.

Company D, First Ohio Volunteer Cavalry. \u2014 Company D was recruited in the latter part of the summer of 1861 by Captain David A. B. Moore, and was mustered into the service on the fifth of October, 1861. It being the first organi zation of its class raised in the county, there was at once manifested a great desire to join its ranks. About the first of December the regiment pro ceeded by rail and steamboat to Louisville, Ken tucky, where it remained until the sixteenth of January, during which time the \u25a0 colonel \u2014 O. P. Ransom \u2014 resigned his commission. Orders were received to join General Thomas at Somerset. After four days' marching the regiment reached Lebanon, Kentucky, where it went into camp. The victory of Mill Springs had been achieved a few days before. On the twelfth of February Lieutenant Colonel T. C. H. Smith also resigned his commission. His place was filled, however, by Colonel Minor Milli kin, who commanded this famous cavalry regiment during most of its brilliant career. The regiment arrived at Nashville, Tennessee, on the sixth of March, and there lay in camp until the fourteenth. It then marched through to the Tennessee river with General Thomas' division, and arrived at Pittsburgh Landing just after the battle of that name had ceased. It took part in the advance upon Corinth, having frequent skir mishes with the enemy, with, however, but slight loss. On the twelfth of June, 1862, the First returned to Corinth, where it remained for about a week. On 'the seventeenth it moved eastward to guard the line of the Mobile & Charleston railroad. Com panies L and M, under command of Captain Pal ten, were stationed at Bear creek, near Iuka. Com panies B, D, G and H, under Colonel Millikin, were stationed at Tuscumbia, the headquarters of General Thomas. The remainder of the regi ment, under Captain Eggleston, proceeded further east to Courtland. A detachment from Tuscumbia, under the command of Captain Emery, had a severe engagement with the rebels about the first of July. On the twenty-fifth of July Courtland was attacked by a large force of rebel cavalry under General Anderson. Two companies of the Tenth Kentucky infantry, and companies E and K of the First Ohio cavalry engaged in this battle, but were defeated. The remnants of the detatchment reached Decatur on the twenty-sixth, from which place they march ed through to Athens, Alabama, rejoining the regi ment on the thirtieth of July."], [345, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 337 On the seventeenth of August, Colonel Millikin, with six companies moved to McMinnville, while the other four, under Captain Patten, were sent on a scout to Fayetteville. On their return they were assigned to duty at General Crittenden's headquar ters. Colonel Millikin, with the First battalion, marched through to Louisville, and on the second day of October left that place and engaged in battle near Shepherdstown, capturing twenty-five prisoners. Major Laughlin's detatchment left Louisville on the second of October, and met the enemy nine miles from Bardstown, where a lively battle ensued, with a loss of twenty-five killed and wounded. The next service of the First cavalry was in the advance of our forces, under General Rosecrans, on Murfreesborough, Tennessee. On the twenty-seventh of December the regi ment had a skirmish at Triune, and on the twenty ninth encountered and defeated Whai ton's brigade of rebel cavalry. In this battle of Stone River, Colonel Minor Millikin was killed. His death was keenly felt by all who knew him, and was mourned by his comrades as the brave mourn for the brave. Major David A. B. Moore, of Newark, was also killed in this battle, and old company D lost a beloved commander, and the country lost a patriotic defender. After the death of Colonel Millikin the com mand of the regiment devolved upon Major Laugh lin. On the first of July, 1863, the regiment entered Tullahoma, and after heavy skirmishing commenced its march over the Cumberland moun tains, encamping the following month near Steven son, Alabama. The regiment was at this time under command of Lieutenant Colonel Cupp. On the nineteenth of September it arrived on the Chickamauga battle-field. After a very severe contest, the battle ended, but not without the loss of its brave commander, Lieutenant Colonel Cupp, who was universally beloved. The command now devolved upon Major T. J. Patten, under whom the First calvary fell back into Chattanooga. On the twenty-sixth of September, General Cr.i.ik's division, of which the First cavalry formed a part, was dispatched to guard the Tennessee liver from Chattanooga to Washington, in east Tennessee. The First was stationed at the latter place. On the first of October the rebel General Wheeler, with eight thousand cavalry, broke through General Crook's lines. A severe engage ment followed, in which our forces were defeated. General Crook hastily gathered up his scattered command and at once set out in pursuit of the rebels, who were advancing rapidly over the moun tains towards McMinnville, and so vigorous was the chase that the rebels dared not stay in one place long enough to effect any damage. The regiment proceeded to march toward Chatt anooga, arriving there on the twenty-second of November. On the evening of the same day, General Sherman having already moved his forces across the river above the town., the First Ohio, and five other cavalry regiments under Colonel Long, crossed over and made a raid in rear of Bragg's position, which, for its brilliant success, is unsurpassed in the annals of the cavalry. About this time Colonel B. B. Eggleston return ed from recruiting service in Ohio, and assumed command of the regiment. January r, 1864, Col onel Eggleston moved the regiment to Pulaski, Tennessee, and from that place they proceeded to Ohio to spend the thirty days furlough, to which all veterans were entitled. On the first of April the First cavalry was again re-united at Nashville, Tennesee, recruited to full ranks. On the twenty-second of May, together with the Third and Fourth Ohio cavalry, under their old commander Colonel Long, it started to join the advancing column of Sherman, then near Rome, Georgia. On the twenty-nineth the regiment participated in a severe engagement at Moulton, resulting in the complete defeat of General Roddy, who had attacked Long's brigade. The regiment joined the main army near Allatoona, on the sixth of June, and remained with it until after the fall of Atlanta. In front of Kenesaw the First cavalry had frequent and severe skirmishing, in which it lost about thirty men. The regiment accompanied General Kilpat rick in his raid around Atlanta. When surrounded by the enemy the First particularly distinguished itself by holding in check for some time a force 1"], [346, "338 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. from Cleburne's rebei infantry division, with a loss of fifty men. Among the killed was Captain Will- iam H. Scott, of company D. Scott was another of Newark's sons. He entered the service as a private soldier, but rapidly advanced through the ranks of second and first lieutenant to a captain- cy on account of his skill and daring as a soldier. At Lovejoy station he and five others charged a rebel battery \u2014 Scott with a hatchet, no other imple- ment being at hand. They took the battery, but were completely surrounded by the rebels, and were obliged to cut their way out with their sabres. Scott was fatally wounded by a shell exploding and killing his horse. A comrade took him from the field when he died. Colonel Eli Long was severely wounded in this battle. The regiment then went into camp near Atlanta. When General Hood attempted to cut Sherman's communications the First cavalry followed in pur- suit. On the seventeenth of November the regi- ment arrived at Louisville, and on the twenty- eighth of December left that place to join the cavalry corps on the Tennessee. James W. Kirkendall, of this county, was about this time, January 6, 1865, promoted to a captaincy and commanded the company until the final mus- ter out. During the month of February, 1865, the First Ohio was transferred from the Second brigade, Second division, and brigaded with the Seventh Ohio and Fifth Iowa, forming the Second brigade, Fourth division, which was placed under the com- mand of Brevet Brigadier General A. J. Alexander. On the twenty-second of April Macon was en- tered, where the force heard of the surrender of Lee. The regiment then garrisoned Georgia and South Carolina, until the thirteenth of September, when it was mustered out, paid off, and discharged at Columbus, Ohio, on the twenty-eighth of Sep- tember, 1865. The company had lost seventeen men in battle and hospital during its term of service. MUSTER IN ROLL OF COMPANY D, FIRST OHIO VOL- UNTEER CAVALRY.

The first move was toward Nashville, Tennessee, thence to Murfrees borough, at which place and vicinity it remained until the army of the Cumberland opened the campaign against General Bragg at Tullahoma. During this campaign, the Tenth cavalry was en gaged wherever duty called, performing a vast amount of marching and fighting, and vanquishing such rebel cavalry as it met. At the battle of Chickamauga, the main portion of the regiment was engaged in guarding commu nications in the rear. After the battle the Tenth was ordered up the Sequatchie valley, and while at this place a portion of the regiment was detailed to accompany a detachment of the Fifteenth Penn sylvania cavalry on a scout into east Tennessee. This detachment was absent from the regiment about three months, and during that time was al most daily engaged with the enemy. At one time the detachment defeated a force of five hundred rebels. The regiment then marched to Ringgold, Georgia, and was at once attached to the Second brigade, Third -division cavalry corps. At the bat tle of Resaca the Tenth, under Colonel Smith, fought valiantly, but with considerable loss. The regiment was actively engaged in all of Kilpatrick's movements during Sherman's Atlanta campaign. The great \"march to the sea\" was inaugurated. This promised serious work for the cavalry. The ene my was first encountered at Jonesville, Georgia, and from that place to Savannah scarcely a day passed without encounters with the rebels. The victory at Lovejoy's station was mainly due to a general charge by the entire division of cavalry. Bear Creek station was next the scene of action, in which battle the Tenth was successful. According to instructions from General Sherman, the regi ment moved on to Macon, and at that place engaged in battle. General Kilpatrick fought his command to within a mile of the city, and under the fire of thirteen pieces of artillery, the Tenth Ohio, led by Captain Hofford, charged the work with drawn sabres, and never halted until the fort was entered and two pieces of artillery were cap tured, but not without heavy loss. Captain J. Hofford was taken prisoner. The enemy was also encountered at Griswoldsville, Gordon and Mill edgeville. When the capital of the State fell into the hands of the national army, Kilpatrick was or dered to move his command and assist in rescuing our prisoners, then in stockades between Millen and Augusta. Kilpatrick proceeded to cross the Oconee river, and move on the Augusta road, by way of the Ogechee shoals. Arriving at the shoals, Captain Estes, with a detachment of the Tenth, left the command and marched rapidly in the direction of Waynesborough, but reaching that place too late to rescue our prisoners, as they had been removed to some point south. The command then withdrew in the direction of Louis ville, Georgia, closely followed by Wheeler, with whom several conflicts occurred, our troops always repulsing their attacks. After a few days' rest at Louisville, orders were received from General Sherman to move toward Augusta. A short distance from Louisville the regiment encountered the rebel cavalry; attacked and drove it in the direction of Waynesborough. The next siege occurred on the first of December, 1864. The national force numbered but five thousand six hundred, while the rebel cavalry numbered from ten to twelve thousand. The Second division moved out in advance. The men of the Ninety second Illinois, on foot, with their Spencer seven shooters, made directly for the barricades, while the Tenth, with drawn sabres, charged on the flanks. The advance squadron of the Tenth was led by Captain Samuel Norton, of company D, who was killed at the head of his column while encourag ing his men to deeds of daring. The enemy was completely routed and driven"], [348, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 34Q eight miles. The loss on both sides was severe. After this engagement the cavalry followed the army on its march to the coast. On reaching the Gulf railroad, Kilpatrick was ordered to cross the Ogechee river and try to communicate with our fleet from Kilkenny bluff. This was accomplished by Captain Estes and Captain Day of the Tenth Ohio cavalry. Colonel Smith, the commander of the Tenth, during the greater part of the time the regiment was in service, was on duty as brigade commander, and although greatly enfeebled by ill health, remained with his command until it reached Cartersville, Georgia, when he was com pelled to leave for home. The regiment participated in the last campaign of the war through the Carolinas, frequently rout ing the enemy and invariably repulsing his attacks. It was finally mustered out at Lexington, North Carolina, on the twenty-fourth of July, 1865, and the men returned to Camp Cleveland for final dis charge and payment. Captain Thayer, who re cruited the first company and was consequently senior captain, was soon promoted to major. Company A had lost five men by death in action and hospital, and its loss in wounded was severe. MUSTER IN ROLL OF COMPANY A, TENTH OHIO VOL- UNTEER CAVALRY. COMMISSIONED OFFICERS.

Stevenson, of the regu- lar army, opened a recruiting office in Newark in the summer of 1861, to procure enlistments for the Eighteenth United States regulars \u2014 a new regi- ment then organizing under Colonel Carrington. Lieutenant Stevenson was assisted by Wilbur F. Arnold and James D. Wallace, two prominent young men of Newark who had patriotically enlist- ed in the Regular service. About eighty men were recruited, from Licking county and forwarded, in detachments, to the gen- eral rendezvous of the regiment at Columbus. The company entered the field the following fall, and did active and efficient service during the war It was engaged in the battles at and near Lebanon, Mill Spring, Somerset, and Louisville, Kentucky. Also at Fort Donelson, Nashville, Shiloh, Corinth, Iuka, Perryville, Stone River, and Mission Ridge. It fought all through the Atlanta campaign, and was with Thomas' army at Franklin, Columbia, and Nashville. Lieutenant Stevenson became quarter master of the regiment, and died in Kentucky during the winter of 1861-62. Lieutenant Wilbur F. Arnold was first quarter- master sergeant and subsequently promoted to sec *ond and first lieutenant. He served gallantly all through the war, and at its close was assigned to duty at Harrisburgh, Pennsylvania, as disbursing officer. He afterwards was ordered on duty in Texas, where he died of disease. Lieutenant Arnold was a young man of high scholarly attain- ments, and although physically disabled, his pat riotism led him to persevere in being accepted into the regular army. The country thus gained the services of a competent and gallant officer. His death, in the morning of a promising manhood, was deeply deplored by his army associates as well as by a host of warm friends at home. Sergeant James D. Wallace recruited most of the men for this company, and being a good drill officer he brought the recruits to a high state of. discipline and efficiency before they entered the field. He was soon promoted to sergeant major of the Second battalion, in consideration of his efficiency as a drill sergeant. Seventeen Licking county men died while serv ing in this company, and many were wounded during the active and dangerous service which fell to the lot of the Eighteenth regulars. As stated in a preceding chapter, many Lick ing county men, not included in the lists herein given, enlisted in companies and regiments in other counties and States. Quite a large detachment of colored men enlisted in the One Hundred and Twenty-seventh Ohio infantry, afterwards known as the Fifth Colored United States infantry. These men saw very severe service under General Butler, near Petersburgh, Virginia, and a number of Newark boys were killed and wounded. De tachments and enlistments from Licking county not heretofore mentioned, entered the following organizations: Seventeenth Ohio volunteer in fantry, One Hundred and Forty-second Ohio national guards, Forty-fifth Ohio volunteer in fantry, Sixth United States cavalry, First Nebraska infantry. Thirtieth Ohio volunteer infantry, Eleventh Ohio volunteer infantry, Twenty-fourth Iowa infantry, Second Ohio heavy artillery, Fourth Ohio cavalry, Eighty-seventh Ohio volunteer in fantry, One Hundred and Ninety-fourth Ohio volunteer infantry, Fifteenth Ohio volunteer in fantry, One Hundred and Twenty-ninth Ohio volunteer infantry, Twenty-first Ohio volunteer in fantry, Twenty-eighth Iowa infantry, Thirty-second Ohio volunteer infantry, Sixth Ohio volunteer in fantry, Ninth Ohio volunteer cavalry, First Iowa cavalry, Seventy-eighth Ohio volunteer infantry, Sixty-First New York infantry, Eleventh Pennsyl vania cavalry, Fourth Iowa infantry, Fourth Ohio 12"], [350, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 342 volunteer infantry, Sixth Ohio volunteer cavalry, One Hundred and Eighty-ninth Ohio volunteer in fantry, Forty-fifth Illinois infantry, Twenty-fourth Ohio volunteer infantry, One Hundred and Twenty-first Ohio volunteer infantry, Thirteenth Ohio volunteer infantry, First United States engi neers, Ninety-third Illinois infantry, One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Ohio volunteer infantry, First United States cavalry, Seventeenth Illinois in fantry, and Eleventh Ohio volunteer cavalry. Many entered the United States navy, the gun boat service, and the United States signal corps. The list would notvbe complete of those who responded to their country's call without making special mention of the band of men who hastily threw aside pressing business engagements at home and entered upon a short term of service when the tide of battle rolled up close to their Ohio fire sides. These men were styled \"Squirrel Hunters,\" they provided themselves with rifles and regular hunting accoutrements, marching forth without uniform or tactics. When Cincinnati was threatened in September, 1862, by the rebel General Kirby Smith, Governor Tod called upon the State to furnish instantly, for a short term of service, all companies or squads of men and individuals who would volunteer for the defence of the State. \"Throughout the interior church and fire bells rang, mounted men galloped through neighborhoods to spread the alarm; there was a hasty cleaning of rifles and moulding of bullets, and filling of powder horns, and mustering at the villages; and every city bound train ran burdened with the gathering host.\" Licking county furnished four hundred and four men for this service, embracing those from all the different walks of life; merchants, clerks, lawyers, and farmers who were tied to such occupations as to prevent them from entering into a longer service. They went to Cincinnati and crossed over into, Kentucky, performing garrison duty in the long line of works which had been thrown up for the pro tection of Cincinnati. After the threatened danger had passed they returned to their homes; and their services were recognized by the whole people of Ohio, and by the Governor who caused to be issued lithograhpic discharges, signed, sealed and deliver ed to the \"Squirrel Hunters.\" CHAPTER XLI.

The soldier was fearful, too, lest the dearly bought laurels he had won would be lost sight of in the busy scenes of varied peaceful avocations' which had since led the country to such prosperity. He became anxious that his sons should enjoy the same blessings after the actors in that epoch had passed away. To secure these blessings to posterity, and to IN 1877 the soldiers of Licking county \u2014 surviv- ors of the late war \u2014 organized a military society and inaugurated the grand movement of soldiers' re -unions, which was so .successfully conducted in the years following throughout the State and in other parts of the country. There seemed to be a prevailing relaxation of interest in the cause which led these men to war seventeen years before. In fact the political aspect of the country warranted the belief that the grand principles so nobly sus-"], [351, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 343 form a more perfect fellowship among comrades then living, a series of re-unions were inaugurated and societies were organized to carry these plans into execution. Another object in view was the revival of the custom of paying respect to the memory of the dead by annual tributes of flowers. This custom had not been observed in Newark since the war, and it became painful to the old soldier in witness ing the continued indifference of citizens to the performance of that duty. With what success the soldiers' society attained these ends can be drawn from a perusal of the reports given of the grand re-union and the observance of Decoration day in the years following its organization. In November, 1877, the society of the soldiers and sailors of Licking county was organized by the election of the following officers: Lieutenant Colonel Joseph C.

He took part in the following named battles: Perryville, Re saca, Dallas, Buzzard's Roost, Rome, Georgia, Franklin, Chattanooga, Chickamauga, Kenesaw Mountain, Peach Tree Creek, Jonesborough, and the capture of Atlanta. He served with his regiment from its muster in till the capture of Atlanta, where he was taken sick and sent with a number of others to Nash ville, and was detailed in the Government printing office till the end of the war. On the seventh day of August, 187 1, he enlisted for the regular army, and was assigned to company K, Seventh United States infantry, stationed at Fort Shaw, Montana Territory. After a short stay at the fort, his company and company B of the same regiment were sent out on an expedition, and when returning were caught in a terrible snow storm, the mercury falling from zero to forty-five degrees below, the result of which was that his feet were so badly frozen that'they had to be am putated two and one-half inches above the ankle. There are few soldiers who have had so many nar row escapes, and yet he is alive and well. Gran ville, Ohio. David Davis, private company D, Seventy-sixth regiment Ohio infantry.

In the winter and spring of 1878, active prepara tions were made for holding a general State re union in Newark under the auspices of the soldiers society. At a meeting held by the officers of the society, January 23d, the president, after consultation with the other officers, appointed the following general committees for the purpose of arranging for a general soldiers' re-union the coming summer. Upon motion, it was resolved that the Re-union be held at the \"Old Fort,\" near Newark, on Mon day, July 2 2d, the anniversary of the death of General McPherson :"], [367, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 359 General Committee of Five. \u2014 i. General Charles R. Woods, on general arrangements. 2. Dr. W. B. Chambers, on finance. 3. Captain Jonathan Rees, on correspondence. 4. Lieutenant S. S. Wells, on banquet. 5. Lieutenant Colonel Charles H. Kibler, on reception. The above to act as chairmen of sub-commit tees: 1. The committee of arrangements will make general arrangements, attend to decorations, ar range order of parade, and attend to such other appropriate duties as will further the success of the re-union. 2. The committee on finance will solicit sub scriptions of money, and pay the same over to the treasurer, for the purpose of defraying the neces sary expenses of the re-union. 3. The committee on correspondence will send invitations, advertise the re-union, and keep records of the proceedings. 4. The banquet committee will solicit contribu tions of eatables, and arrange the banquet. 5. The reception committee will receive, enter tain and direct visitors, and provide places for them during their sojourn in the city. The county committees (at least one in each township), will rally members and visitors to attend the re-union, and will attend to such other neces sary work as will further the success of the re union. In addition to the foregoing committees, the chairmen of the township committees were author ized to appoint a committee of ladies in their respective townships, to solicit cooked provisions, and to arrange and superintend a table set apart and marked for each township. General Woods, chairman of the committee of general arrangements, published an address in the county papers, calling upon the people to contrib ute from their abundance for the occasion, that all soldiers might be furnished a free dinner. The secretary also prepared, and sent to the township committees, subscription books, for the purpose of collecting money for defraying the ex penses of the re-union. The officers of the society met with all the com mittees and took part in the proceedings. To the correspondence committee was assigned the first important duties to be performed; and the chairman, with the assistance of the secretary, opened up an extensive correspondence with the heads of the various military bodies throughout the State, with a view of securing the largest attendance and of drawing to the re-union features that would prove interesting and attractive. Gen eral Charles R. Woods rendered valuable service to the committee in addressing letters to distin guished military men, inviting them to be present. Very patriotic answers were received in reply from many. This committee caused to be printed and mailed to over seven hundred soldiers a general printed invitation. With this circular letter was also sent a map and description of the \"old fort,\" the place chosen for holding the re-union. Printed letters of invitation of like purport were sent to the commanders of all the Ohio national guard companies and batteries. Three thousand large posters, printed in colors, were prepared and one sent to each of the twenty-three hundred post offices throughout the State. Bundles of the same were also sent to the large towns and cities, to be posted in conspicuous places; and it can be said to the credit of the society that the programme promised was fully carried out. The resident correspondents of the metropolitan and local press noticed the progress of the prepa rations for the re-union with favorable comments, which added extensively to its advertisement. The letter received from General Grant, by the secretary, was given to the press and widely pub lished throughout the Union. In fact, all was done by the correspondence committee to widely circulate the call for a State re-union and to im press upon the minds of the veterans of Ohio the fact that they would be cordially welcomed and entertained. The finance committee commenced its laborious duties early in June, and it was with the greatest difficulty that necessary funds could be raised con sidering the stringency of the times, but when the people began to realize the magnitude of the undertaking and the promised beneficial results that would accrue, it can be said to their credit"], [368, "36\u00b0 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. that they responded with that liberality that in sured success. The committee of general arrangements, headed by that admiral campaigner, General Charles R. Woods, owing to the undeveloped results of the work of the correspondence and finance commit tees, did not begin the performance of its duties until within two weeks of the eventful day, but with skill and earnest application its work pro gressed rapidly and ended successfully, as the sequel shows. Fifteen hundred feet of tables were erected at the fort, whereon to spread the free dinner for the guests. A large stand for speakers was prepared, with seating capacity for over two hundred persons. The ground around the circular embankment was staked off and space allotted for two hundred and thirty-nine veteran organizations of Ohio infantry, cavalry and artillery regiments. On each stake was attached a small American flag, and a register book wherein soldiers visiting the re-union could register their names, command and post office address. The stakes were placed in regular order, com mencing at the left hand of the great gateway of the fort, with the first infantry, and continued around the entire circle in order by numbers. The committee of general arrangements super intended the decorations of the fort and the city, which were on a very elaborate scale. It arranged the order of march and performed many other im portant duties which added greatly to the success of the re-union. The reception committee, under the manage ment of Colonel Kibler, performed valuable ser vice in providing quarters for the military bodies and distinguished guests on that day. The most arduous duty performed by this committee was upon the morning of the twenty-second, in receiv ing the various commands arriving upon the trains, which was rendered more laborious by the confu sion necessarily caused in such a vast assemblage of people arriving mostly in an unorganized con dition. The banquet committee was relieved in a great measure in participating in the preparation of the dinner at the fort, by the untiring and zealous at tention of the ladies. Too much cannot be said in praise of the noble part taken by the ladies of Newark on this occasion, and it is to be regretted that many sacrificed the pleasures of the day in their unselfish devotion to the duties assigned to them. The ladies of the various township committees deserve the thanks of the society for the elaborate and generous preparation they made at their re spective tables for the entertainment of the guests. The banquet committee, proper, composed of gentlemen, confined its labors in preparation of the banquet held in the evening at the Lansing house. The lateness of the hour and the exhaustion of the people caused the attendance at the banquet to fall short of expectations, but the speeches of distinguished soldiers, in response to toasts on that occasion, weie very fine and inspiring. Several special committees were appointed, which deserve mention. A committee, consisting of Captains Rees and Lyon, was sent to Washing ton to enlist the interest of the heads of the Gov ernment in the re-union and to secure the attend- , ance of the President and other distinguished soldiers and statesmen. General J. Warren Keifer was invited by the committee to act as orator of the day, and it af forded the society great pleasure when that gentle man accepted, as his oration proved to be the most appropriate performance for the occasion that could possibly have been delivered. The oration was rich in statistical information and portrayed the deeds, the valor and the sacrifices of Ohio sol diers in that war, with a vividness that will inspire the generations to come, as it did the veterans on that day who heard it from his lips. Committees were also sent to Columbus to per sonally invite the governor and State officials, and to secure the old battle flags for the occasion. A committee was appointed to arrange with the lines of railways centering at Newark, to carry visi tors to and from the re-union at special low rates of fare, and to furnish adequate transportation for the multitude. It is to be regretted that the rail road officials did not fully realize the magnitude of the affair in time to provide, cars for the comforta ble transportation of the people, and many in re mote parts of the State were deprived of the pleasure of particitating in the re-union."], [369, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 361 In connection with the work of the committees it may be stated that the secretary opened negotia tions with the quartermaster general of Wisconsin to secure the attendance of \"Old Abe,\" the cele brated war eagle of Wisconsin, which succeeded in procuring the presence of that famous bird. In order to secure the battle flags of the various veteran organizations expected to be represented at the re-union, it became necessary to have passed by the legislature then in session, an act authoriz ing the adjutant general to loan the same for the occasion. The society was indebted to the Hon. James W. Owens for the passage of a resolution which secured the desired end. As before stated, the transportation arrange ments of the railway lines were not adequate to carry the people desirous of attending the re-union, and in many parts of the State railroad corpora tions connecting with lines reaching Newark, de clined to grant special rates, under the misappre hension that the number of people contemplating the journey would not justify a reduction of the fare. The sequel proved the lack of foresight in the management of the lines. The Pan Handle route of the Pittsburgh, Cincin aati & St. Louis railroad and the Ohio divisions of the Baltimore & Ohio railroad, being the two lines passing directly through Newark, gave excursion rates, which attracted large crowds over their re spective roads and added greatly to their source of revenue. The Cleveland, Mt. Vernon & Colum bus road, connecting with the Baltimore & Ohio at Mt. Vernon, and the Marietta & Cleveland road, connecting at Cambridge and Uhrichsville, made liberal transportation arrangements, which resulted in full trains over their lines. Notwithstanding the inadequate provisions made by other roads in remote parts of the State, so great was the anxiety of soldiers to be present on so interesting an occasion, that they came from all parts in large numbers. The re-union was one of all organizations in Ohio, and the first general State re union of the veterans since the war; hence it would have been proper for all roads within the borders of Ohio to have furnished such liberal facilities for attendance as the importance of the occasion de manded. The Pittsburgh, Cincinnati & St. Louis railroad brought in from the west one extra and one regu lar train, and from the east two extra trains, con sisting in all of fifty coaches, averaging seventy five people to the coach, making a total of about thirty-five hundred people. The Baltimore & Ohio railroad brought in from the east two trains of twenty-eight cars; from the west, one train of eleven cars; from the north, two trains of thirty-six cars; and from the south, two trains of thirty-two cars; making in all one hundred and six cars, carrying six thousand five hundred people. This was on Monday morning, the day of the re-union. The Saturday and Sunday trains brought in about one thousand people, who came in advance, to secure hotel accommodations. By far the greatest outpouring was from the county. The farms and villages were nearly de populated. It was a gala day for \"old Licking\" and the people, for once, closed up their houses and came en masse to Newark. The inducement was sufficient to justify the in habitants for one day to lay aside their usual avo cations and make a holiday. It was the first time in the history of the county that the President of the United States was to be a guest of her citizens. And the interest was three-fold enhanced by the presence at the same time of the general of the army and the governor of Ohio. But we must not overlook the still greater interest, which was in the meeting of old comrades, many of whom had not crossed palms since the days of the war. From early dawn until mid-day all roads leading into the city were thronged with wagons asd car riages, not only bringing men, women and chil dren, but laden with good things to satisfy the \"inner man;\" rations without stint for our soldier guests. The country people generally corralled their teams about the fair-grounds, as is their cus tom during fair times, and it was not many hours after daylight that the many acres outside and around the embankment were literally packed with every description of vehicle. To estimate the number of people in a promis cuous gathering like this is a problem, the solution of which leads to a great diversity of opinion. The reporters of the press are as liable to err as any others who take a casual view of the question."], [370, "362 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. By reference to the reports herein given, the repre sentatives of the different papers widely differ in their estimates of the number of people present on that day, which is further proof of their incom petency in the matter. It is only by documentary and other like evidence that a fair and reliable estimate can be arrived at. By careful observa tion of the seven main roads leading into Newark, fifteen thousand came from the country; one thousand arrived by rail before Monday. The Pittsburgh, Cincinnati & St. Louis railroad brought thirty-five hundred; the Baltimore & Ohio railroad brought sixty-five hundred, and at least five thou sand citizens of the city participated, making a grand total of thirty-one thousand. The following account of the re-union by the Cincinnati Gazette, which for fairness and accur acy, seems to have merit over all others, is given in full, with the exception of the speeches: Special dispatch to the Cincinnati Gazette. Newark, Ohio, July 22, 1878. \"The gallant McPherson is remembered to-day.\" So runs a legend on a fine garrison flag that floats over the street on one of the principal squares of Newark. Remembered, indeed, to-day, is that beau ideal of the American officer, gallant, courteous, genial, commanding in appearance as he was, until even his black horse was an object of the affections of the thou sands of soldiers. Remembered is he as the officer, who four teen years ago to-day, when his Army of the Tennessee was receiving the fiery force of the whole body of the impetuous Hood's army, rode into a woods swarming with rebel troops, and, while pushing on to reach the position where he supposed his own troops were most hotly pressed, rode into the presence of a rebel line, and in a moment was shot down. His riderless horse escaped, and, though no friendly eye, except an orderly, saw General McPherson fall, the fact of his death was soon conveyed to General Sherman. Not, however, till the battle had been won by his troops was the fact of his death spoken, except in whispers. Probably no officer in the whole army had such a hold upon his soldiers as did McPherson, and his tragi cal death makes the anniversary of that battle one of sad inte rest to all who fought on the field where McPherson fell. It was in consequence of this feeling that to-day was selected by the Soldiers' and Sailors' association of Licking county, of which General Charles R. Woods is a member, for a re-union of soldiers. General Woods was a member of the Army of the Tennessee, and at the battle of July 22nd was in the thickest of the fight, as he commanded the First division of the Fifteenth army corps. General Woods is now a retired army officer, living in quiet comfort in a beautiful home in the suburbs of Newark. He has seen much service, having been in the war from the time the Star in the West was fired upon until its close, and afterward held an important command in the South during the progress of reconstruction. Veteran as he is, there is a tender place in his heart for the memory of McPherson, and it is mainly that which prompted the selection of this day for the annual re-union. The organization in charge of the day's festivities is not a political one. It is composed of men who were in the Union army, and they are here, as elsewhere, not all of one mind in the matter of politics, although they are unanimous in rejoicing over the success of the cause that took them to the tented field. Among the active workers in charge of the arrangements are to be found Democrats and Republicans together, and among the contributors to the fund to pay expenses there has been no dis crimination on account of political faith. This is a soldiers' re-union. Perhaps the gladdest workers among the many who have len a hand in the preparations are the ladies of Newark, and of these none can be gladder than the wives, mothers, sisters and sweethearts of the men who, fourteen years ago to-day, were in that battle before Atlanta. To these this work is a thanks offering for the preservation of those who came out of that danger alive, and an incense to the memory of the heroic dead. It would not be strange if tears have hallowed the decorations of to-day. The ladies have worked with a devotion equal to that which marked their patriotism during ihe war. The count less little flags that seem to be flying through the air, but which are fastened to long cords that extend in all directions from the lofty dome of the finest court house in the State, all represent women's work. Each little flag has been stitched to its place by a woman's hand. And then the preparation of the soldier's dinner. What heart there has been in that ! \"Poor fellow,\" they say, \"he shall have such a dinner to-day as he did not get fourteen years ago.\" Or, if there is a headstone over his grave marked \"killed July 22, 1864, before Atlanta,\" still the feeling is \"we will set before his comrades something in remembrance of our poor boy.\" And so the feast has been prepared in. thankful joy and in tender remembrance. While almost everything has been done by private contribu tion, the re-union has become so popular as to obtain assist ance both from the county and the city. The commissioners donated fifty dollars and the council gave two hundred dollars. There is a story that only one member of the council opposed this appropriation, and he was so earnest in his convictions that he sought the aid of the law to prevent the payment of the money. But his fellow councilmen were alert, and when he came to the city clerk with an injunction, that officer had paid out the money. Then he enjoined the banker where he under stood the two hundred dollars had been deposited, but when he found the cash was not there, and that it was going about from pocket to pocket in such a mysterious manner that \"no fellow could find out\" where to lay an injunction, he gave up the effort. The decorations are profuse and tasteful. A fine effect is produced by stretching from the high dome of the court house which stands in the middle of a large square, to housetops all around, cords upon which are fastened little flags about four feet apart. All the great flags that can be gathered are sus pended over the streets. Evergreen wreathing appears on many houses. A triple arch spans the street leading west from the court house. This is adorned with evergreens and flags, and with a large sized portrait of the beloved McPherson, suspended under the central arch. \"Welcome Comrades,\" is on the arch' while on the others are the names, McPherson, Custer, Mc- Cook, and Lytle- The celebration began with a Federal salute at sunrise. The artillery used was of a kind that woke the town as effectually"], [371, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 363 as the long roll would have called up a regiment. Very soon after the streets began to assume a lively appearance. Long before six o'clock farmers' wagons were coming in filled with the men and women folks, and not always leaving out the children. Small boys took the liberty to fire off diminutive pistols on the public square, and now and then to give vent to their feelings through a fire-cracker or a torpedo. The weather fully re deemed its promise of assistance, the morning breaking with a delicious coolness that made shawls and heavy coats desirable. General Sherman spent the Sabbath at Lancaster, and this morning performed the neat manceuver of flanking a well in tentioned cavalry escort that intended to do him the honor of meeting him a mile or two out of town. He drove over in a carriage, the distance being twenty-eight miles. He was ex pected to arrive about eight o'clock, but he is an early riser, and a rapid mover, so he left Lancaster asleep and rattled over the country, arriving here more than an hour earlier than he was expected. The good intentions of the cavalry company, com posed as it was of old cavalrymen who served under him, were entirely thwarted by this early movement, and they had their morning ride for nothing. However, no blame must attach to General Sherman for their disappointment, for he was not aware that any such honor was in store for him, and he would be the last man to wilfully thwart such kindly meant intention. The desire has been expressed again and again during the day that the soldiers should be designated in some way, so that people might know who they were. This seems to have been overlooked by the managers, but since their arrival this morning a good many of the soldiers have modestly ticketed their hats with little cards bearing the letter of their company and the number of their regiment. The device affords a means of iden tification that leads to many pleasant renewals of army ac- quaintance, for every soldier feels that he is acquainted with the boys who were in his brigade at least. The veteran regiment organized for the day wras designated by badges on its members. The proudest man in Newark to-day is Billy Lafflin, the veteran hackman, whose carriage was selected to carry the President from the depot to the hotel. He was a coachman be fore he came to this country, but in America he has advanced to the proprietorship of an equipage, and to-day his horses were in their neatest trim, and himself the perfection of good taste in dress. The ladies had decorated his hack with evergreens and flowers, surmounting it with an eagle with outspread wings. He drove around the public square an hour before time for the train to arrive, exhibiting his tasteful turnout to admiring crowds. The first cheers of the day were those evoked by the presence of \"Old Abe,\" the veteran war eagle. He made his appear ance before the President arrived, borne on a shield by a ve teran, and escorted by a drum band and a little company of soldiers following a tattered flag. The flag and the little com pany of men only suggested the strong regiments that are gone, while the eagle alone seems to have renewed his strength. The bird who has such an eventful history, who followed the Eighth Wisconsin regiment through the war, and who now devotes his time to attending soldiers' re-unions all over the country, is as fresh looking as he ever was. And when the soldiers cheered him, he listed his wings as if remembering the old times, and giving, in his way, a return to their warm-hearted salute. It was nearly ten o'clock before the second excursion train from Columbus, bearing the Presidential party and Governor's uards, and companies A, B and F, of Columbus, arrived at the Pan Handle depot. With the President were Attorney Gen eral Devens, Governor Bishop, General Keifer, Secretary of State Barnes, Adjutant General Meilly, General Wycoff, General Walcutt, Hon. S. F. Hunt, the governor's staff, etc. There were several thousand present, and it was some time before the car containing the Presidential party could be brought to the proper place for leaving the car, and the distinguished visitors escorted to their carriages by the reception committee. Imme diately on being seated in the carriage, the President was sur rounded by hundreds of citizens who insisted on shaking hands, and that invariable American ceremony tvas indulged in for nearly ten minutes. Meantime the salute of twenty-one guns was fired by the Cleveland artillery. The order ol march to the Lansing house was as follows: The Newark guards. Barracks band, Cadet band, Governor's Guard drum corps, Governor's guards, the carriage containing President Hayes, Governor Bishop, Attorney General Devens, and a number of the reception committee, carriages containing the other mem bers of the Presidential party, the mayor of the city/etc, and companies A, B and F, of Columbus. Arriving at the Lansing house, the President was immediately escorted to his room, where he remained till the moving of the procession, the hall leading to his room being jammed contin ually by hundreds eager to catch if but a passing glimpse of the Chief Magistrate. It was half-past eleven o'clock before the procession began to move. The streets around the public square had been kept free from intrusion by stretching ropes at each entrance, to pre vent vehicles from coming, but people on foot crowded in and gave infinite trouble to the nervous marshals on horseback. The President, General Sherman, and Governor Bishop, and other distinguished guests, had been seated in their carriages nearly half an hour before the procession began to move, not withstanding they were to follow all the troops. The President was again subjected to another spell of hand-shaking, which would have been more general, if the police had not exerted themselves to keep his carriage free from the crowd. As it was, there was but little harm done, as the weather was charmingly cool with a good breeze, and though the President was in a covered carriage, and armed with a huge serviceable palm leaf fan, it lay idle most of the time in his lap. The music at last announced the nlioving of the procession, and it passed the Lansing house, where the President and party were in waiting, in the following order: Colonel Joseph C. Wehrle and staff; band of music; company of veteran cavalry; Granville cornet band; more cavalry, followed by Shermans Bummers, composed of a dozen or so men on horseback, dressed after the style of that unique corps, and equipped with oal sheaves, tin coffee pots, hams, chickens, and a miscellane ous lot of eatables; another cavalry company; Cambridge mili tary band; Ohio national guards, two companies; drum band; Ohio national guards, one company; drum band; artillery corps; General Charles R. Woods and staff; Columbus Bar racks band; \"Old Abe,\" the Eighth Wisconsin war eagle; vet eran corps, ten companies, interspersed with drum and military bands, and bearing battle stained regimental flags. One of the most affecting features of the procession, was a horse ridden by a boy, and almost covered with flags. He wore a placard reading, \"Old Charley, who led the Thirty-first Ohio three years.\" The veteran war horse was not so nimble as Ten Broeck, but even his stiff gait made him an object of affection ate interest in the eyes of all who know what such a history as"], [372, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 364 \"Old Charley's\" implies. When the veterans had all passed, the Governor's guards wheeled into platoons and followed, and then the carriages containing the President and other distin guished guests moved after them, and thej procession was all under way. Long before the procession reached the fair grounds the people from the country had flocked in, and vehicles by the hundreds were hitched on every available acre in and around ;the enclosure, their occupants by the thousands being scattered over every part of the grounds, and lining almost every foot of the dusty mile and a half between there and Newark. Their enthusiasm was boundless. \"Old Abe,\" the Wiscpnsin war eagle, elicited1 cheer upon cheer, and divided the homage of the multitude with the Presi dent and General Sherman. He was placed upon the speaker's stand, and near the front, where he surveyed the multitude with a royal air, as if conscious of his representing the dignity of a sis ter State. With much difficulty the marshals cleared away the specta tors sufficiently to permit of the displaying of the military, and the approach of the carriages containing the distinguished visi tors, who had no sooner been seated on the platform than the crowd swept to it and clambered on it from all sides. Almost at once the west side fell, but harmlessly. The reporters were forced out of their seats. The northeast corner settled down* and it was not until a detachment of the Governor's guards had cleared the platform of unauthorized spectators that sufficient quiet was obtained, and the exercises proceeded in the proper order. The exercises began by prayer by Chaplain B. C. Bates (formerly of Cincinnati). Then followed General Warner's ad dress of welcome. It was now after three o'clock, and an interesting part of the day was not yet touched \u2014 the dinner for the veterans, the national guards and the distinguished guests. The prettiest thing of the day was the grand dining rooms in the woods, which extended over several acres of ground, and was filled with hundreds of feet in length of tables, which were perfect pictures of peace and plenty. Thousands of tired men, repre senting nearly every regiment organized in Ohio, gathered about them, each one sen-ed with a pasteboard plate, a new tin cup, a spoon, and a buttonhole bouquet. Not the least sign of disorder was anywhere visible. There was plenty to eat and plenty of room, every one helping himself. The bill of fare in cluded cold meats of every description, golden rolls, baked beans, pies, pickles, hot coffee and cakes fit to grace the table of the President ; and there he stood, under the shade of a grand old beach, enjoying the hospitality of the women as much as any other soldier. The old battle flags of the Ohio regiments were taken from the flag room in the State house and carefully arranged in floral hall, in the fair grounds, where they received the almost un bounded homage of thousands. But the precedent thus made should not be allowed to prevail. These tattered and faded mementos of Ohio's glory are quite too precious to be carried around to the many re-unions we shall have in the State, highly gratifying though their presence is to every soldier or citizen. The crowd present was immense, and estimates vary from fifteen thousand to thirty thousand. Perhaps twenty thousand is a sufficiently high estimate for those actually on the ground, though there were thousands who remained in the city, and were satisfied to look on the decorations, the glimpses of visit- ing greatness they could occasionally catch, and patiently wait for the return from the fair-grounds, and the fireworks at night. One good feature was the placing of stakes about twenry feet apart on the inside of the top of the embankment of the old fort. To each stake was a small flag and a book attached, one for every regiment and battery from Ohio in the war, and in which the soldiers of each were requested to register. A large number availed themselves of the opportunity, and a tolerable complete register is thus expected to be made. The citizens of Newark have been most hospitable in their entertainment of their hosts of guests. They not only engi neered very successfully a gigantic gathering, but have as well succeeded in making all who were here feel at home. The President and General Devens took tea this evening at the resi dence of Judge Jerome Buckingham. Miss Ella Sherman drove the carriage Containing her father and General John M. Connell, from Lancaster here this morn ing, in three and a half hours. Supper over, the woods of the grounds became versatile with the music of the many bands. Hundreds of veterans walked about the circle, registered their names in the little books, and scanned them for the names of comrades. Then came the re turn to the city, where the sound of drum and cornet bands, the shouts of people, and the roll of vehicles, told how glad had been the day. President Hayes' reception, at the Lansing house, was most heartily enthusiastic. Webb Hayes introduced the callers to the President, who gave to each one, at least, a word and a hand-shake. General Sherman wras present in uniform, and added splendor to the occasion. Governor Bishop also attended the reception, and was greeted warmly by many admirers. The rooms were kept reasonably clear, though there was a great jam in the hall. Webb Hayes, with good judgment, promptly took the Presi dent to his room at nine o'clock. General Sherman, however, remained, and chatted familiarly with old army acquaintances. The display of fireworks at night was the only thing on the programme that began ahead of time. It was to begin at nine o'clock and last an hour, but the rockets began to fly at half past eight, and from that time till after ten there was an almost uninterrupted blaze of fireworks. It was enjoyed by a great crowd of people in the park and in the streets, and during its progress there was a continual concert of drum and other bands in different parts of the 'city. There was almost perfect order, very little drunkenness being seen. The day and night were as perfect as could be wished, and Newark may be grateful for this important adjunct to their successful enterprise. One hundred and seventy-nine Ohio regiments and batteries were represented at this re-union. One hundred and twenty-one of the old battle flags were displayed. Among the many distinguished persons present may be mentioned President R. B. Hayes, General James A. Garfield, President elect in 1880, General W. T. Sherman, Governor R. M. Bishop, Attorney General Charles Devens, General J. Warren Keifer, Ex-Governer Fletcher of Mis souri, General Wager Swayne, General Durbin"], [373, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 365 Ward, General M. D. Leggett, General John Beat ty, General Charles C. Walcutt, General Charles H. Grosvenor and General Willard Warner. The expenses of the re-union, owing to the skilful management of the finance committee, only reach ed the sum of one thousand and seventy-five dol lars and eighty-three cents, which left of the fund contributed for the occasion an unexpended bal ance of one hundred and forty-three dollars and seventy-three cents. This sum remains in the treasury of the society as a nucleus fund for the erection of a soldiers' monument. The city of Newark reaped a great benefit from the re-union in all branches of its trade. It is es timated that the sum of fifty thousand dollars, at least, was left in the city by strangers on that day. The secretary, Major C. D. Miller, prepared, and had printed, in book form, illustrated with steel engravings and electrotypes, a very complete report of the re-union, which embraced a full ac count of the exercises, with speeches and letters of the most distinguished men of the nation; a his torical sketch of the regiments and batteries repre sented, with a list of the names of soldiers regis tered; a history of \"Old Abe,\" the war eagle, and a record of Licking county soldiers who died in the service. The society reserves a number of copies of this work for distribution among soldiers' families at the net cost of publication. CHAPTER XLII. HISTORY OF THE WAR CONTINUED.

Joseph Meister was a member of the Society of the Soldiers and Sailors of Licking county, and his was the first death occurring in the society. \"Rest on, embalmed and sainted dead, Dear as the blood ye gave ; No traitor's footsteps e'er shall tread The herbage o'er your grave. Nor shall your glory be forgot, While Fame her record keeps, For Honor mourns the hallowed spot Where loyal valor sleeps.\" The following is a list of the names of soldiers buried in the Newark cemeteries, in addition to those given above. The list may yet be imperfect, and the secretary of the society would thank the friends of those who have been omitted to furnish their names, that they may be preserved in the re cords of the society, and that they may be hon ored by the annual tribute of flowers on Decora tion day. The list embraces soldiers of the Revolution, the war of 1812, the Mexican war and the War of the great Rebellion, and of all soldiers who have died recently or since the Rebellion: BURIED IN CEDAR HILL CEMETERY.

Many Licking county soldiers are buried in other parts of the county, but far the greatest number rest in the fields far south, where their blood bathed the land they fought for. Many lie in unmarked graves near the prison pens of Andersonville, and upon the sites of sanguinary battle fields where they fell. The tears of their fellow-patriots cannot wash out the memories of their deeds \u2014 and, although their ashes repose far away from the land of their birth, yet when the last trumpet sounds the great awakening, all alike will arise to glory. Cover them over with beautiful flowers, Deck them with garlands, those brothers of ours; Lying so silent, by night and bv day, Sleeping the years of their manhood away; Years they had marked for the joys of the brave; Years they must waste in the sloth of the grave. All the bright laurels they fought to make bloom, Fell to the earth when they went to the tomb. Give them the meed they have won in the past; Give them the honors their merits forecast; Give them the chaplets they won in the strife; Give them the laurels they lost with their life. Cover them over \u2014 yes, cover them over \u2014 Parent, and husband, and brother, and lover; Crown in your heart these dead heroes of ours, And cover them over with beautiful flowers.

BENNINGTON township was organized in 18 1 5. It is situated on the northern borders of Licking county, bounded on the east by Burling ton township, on the west by Hartford, on the south by Liberty, and on the north aby Knox county. that respect as townships further east, notably Fallsburgh and Eden. This is essentially a township of farmers, there being no railroad, telegraph, turnpike, or canal within its limits, and but one small town. When the first settlers entered the township, they found it heavily timbered with many varieties of hard wood, such as usually grow on the up lands. The different families of oak were largely predominant, though beech, sugar, and other hard woods were plenty. The undergrowth was hazel, paw-paw, hackberry, and, in minor proportions, spicewood, sassafras and other varieties. The settlers in nearly every part of it found it necessary to clear away this timber in order to make room for their cabins. This fine timber has been largely cleared away, and beautiful, well-fenced farms oc cupy its place. The soil is fertile, well tilled and as productive as any in the county. The general face of the township is level or gently undulating, and it is well watered by North fork of Licking and its tributaries. The North fork rises partly in the northwest corner of this township, and passing a short distance through the north- ern part, enters Knox county about the center of the northern line of this township, re-entering the township again and passing across the north- east corner. The largest stream in the township \u2014 which, however, is not large \u2014 is the Otter fork, a tributary of the North fork. It passes across the township from west to east, near its center, pass ing across part of Burlington township, and enter- ing the North fork near the village of Homer. The Lake fork, another tributary of the North fork, rises in the southern and western parts of this township, and running eastwardly, passes across the southern portion of this and Burlington town- ships, entering the North fork in Washington township about half way between Utica and St. Louisville. Upon a tributary of Lake fork, Indian run, is situated the village of Appleton. The tributaries of this stream water all the southern part of the township. Many beautiful springs are located in this township, but it is not so prolific in Bennington presents few traces of the Mound Builders, and those not remarkable. The Indians seem to have left few traces or reminiscences of their occupation. Few, or perhaps, no people now living in the township remember seeing them, and they probably had no permanent camp within its limits, at least in historic times. A very small camp, not however permanent, once had an existence on Indian run, near its junction with the Lake fork. It disappeared shortly after the first settlement, but probably gave name to that stream. The first white settler in the township was 5.7"], [408, "398 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. the first store in the place. Mr. Long, in order to encourage enterprise and assist in building up the town squeezed his family into the single back room of this storehouse. He had, since his advent in the place, been using the upper room of this building for a cabinet shop. A pair of stairs went up on the outside of the building, and here he made tables, coffins, and other necessaries of life and death, and for himself a precarious living. Mr. Messenger must have expected to transact a large business, as he brought on a large stock of goods, for those days, and two clerks. Had the wolves and bears been his customers he would, no doubt, have done a large business, but as the pur chasing settlers were few and far between, the two clerks seemed superfluous. These two clerks took boarding and lodging in the family of Mr. Long in that single back room of the store building. One of these clerks was Mr. Franklin Bryant, who, after clerking some time for Mr. Messenger, bought the store himself and conducted it several years. He built the second frame house in town, which is yet standing, and is occupied as a dwelling by Dr. Austin. Not being able to fill up that little back room entirely, with his family and two clerks, Mr. Long took in an other entire family \u2014 Mr. William Van Fossen, wife and one child. Mr. Van Fossen had made up his mind to settle here, and to accommodate him while his cabin was in course of construction Mr. Long admitted the family as boarders. The other young gentleman clerk, who was a boarder in this large family with limited quarters, was usually called \"Billy,\" and as he. had very lit tle clerking to do, spent most of the time in the woods hunting. Mrs. Long says \"he was a good boy \u2014 a jolly, wholersouled fellow as ever lived.\" His last name was Rosecranz, and he afterward became Major General William S. Rosecranz, the hero of Stone River, and the gallant but unfortu nate commander of the Union forces at the great and bloody battle of Chickamauga. \"Billy\" Rosecranz remained here as a clerk six months, and many times declared his intention of becom ing a soldier, and was sent to West Point soon after leaving this place. His father was at that time a resident of Homer, in the adjoining town ship, and a merchant and farmer. Henry lies, who settled there in the spring of 1809. He was from Rockingham county, Vir ginia. John Dripps and Isaac Vanausdel followed him in 1810, locating near the North fork. John Trout, in the same or next year, located on Otter fork, where also Peter \"Staymates settled soon after. Settlers continued to come in year after year, gen erally from Pennsylvania and Virginia, until the principal part of the territory of the township was settled. It was divided into ordinary sized farms, and nearly all the township occupied, by 1835. The \"Cook settlement\" was established in the vicinity of the present village of Appleton, some time after the close of the war of 18 12, by Titus Knox and Captain Cook, and served as a nucleus for immigrants to the southern portion of the township. The Van Fossens, Jesse Smith, Jacob Clem, the Wrights, Sangers, Carvers, McClintocks, Fishburns, and Trouts were among the names of those familiarly known as early settlers. In August, 1832, Titus Knox and Carey Mead laid out the village of Appleton, and named it in honor of Appleton Downer, a lawyer of Zanes ville, who had been a large land owner in the township. It is handsomely situated in a beauti ful country, near the southern borders of the township, but it never attained to the proportions of a town of one hundred inhabitants, and has been on the decline in later years. Carey Meade built the first house in Appleton, and there is something of a romantic history con nected with it. Mr. Meade had a pretty daughter who married a man named Delong, from the east, and Mr. Meade erected this house for a store room, with the expectation that his son-in-law would bring on a stock of goods and become the first merchant of the future city. For reasons very well understood this expectation was not real ized, and thus the storeroom \u2014 a frame structure, one and a half stories in height \u2014 stood empty for a time, and was the only building on the town plat when Mr. Gideon Long and family came to the place, April 3, 1833. Mr. Long moved into this empty store room and occupied it some years. While he was yet living in it Mr. David Messenger, yet living, a resident of Utica, and now a very aged man, came to Appleton, or the site of it, rented the front part of this building, and opened"], [409, "HISTORY FO LICKING COUNTY. 399 This old store room is yet standing, and is part of the present store building of Mr. B. G. Hoover. The Van Fossen cabin was probably the second or third cabin in the town. The first school-house in this neighborhood, a log building, was erected some years before Apple- ton was laid out, and was located where Mr. Bigler now lives. Joseph Kerr taught school here fifty- five years ago, and was probably the first teacher in this part of the township. The second school- house was a frame building and stood above Mr. Barrick's house on Harry Ashley's farm. The third and present house \u2014 a good frame building \u2014 was erected about 1870. All the children of school age in town attend school here; they num- ber fifty or sixty. The first blacksmith shop in Appleton was erected by Mr. Snyder, who soon moved away, and Mr. John Copper occupied the shop and be- came the permanent blacksmith. The old store building has always been occupied for that purpose, having changed hands many times, and been added to. In addition to Mr. Hoover's store, Mr. W. T. Moorehead keeps a small stock of goods at present, and Franklin Myers a small grocery. Be- sides this mercantile business, there are two wagon shops, two blacksmith shops, two shoe shops, two hotels, and Gideon Long (Mr. Long and wife are both yet living) still carries on cabinet making. The village is a pleasant one, the society good, the people being much interested in both religious and secular education. The tillage of Lock is located on the northern . line of this township, but the larger part of it is in Knox county, the post office and store being in that county. It is probable that Gideon Long was the first post master in Appleton and retained the office many years; it is now kept by Thomas More- head. The first water-mill in this township \u2014 or mill of any kind \u2014 was erected by Jesse Van Fossen, about a half mile above Appleton, on Indian run. It was a saw-mill only. John Denty, yet living a mile above Appleton, erected the second mill, at the junction of Indian run and Lake fork. This mill was both a grist and saw-mill in an early day, though at present only a saw-mill, driven by steam power. It is the only mill now in the township. In the old log school-house, before mentioned as standing on the place where Mr. Bigler now lives, was organized in 1828, what was probably the first religious society in the township. They call themselves Christians, but are generally^_better known as New Lights. The well known pioneer preacher, Rev. Isaac N. Walters, was instrumental in establishing this church, and was assisted in the organization by Rev. Daniel Long and Rev. Matthew Gardner. A number of the old settlers accepted the new doc trine, among whom were Jesse VanFossen and wife, Catharine; John Helphrey; Jesse Lake and wife, Elizabeth; Daniel Helphrey and wife, Mr. McNett and wife, and others. The old school house answered the purposes of this society sev eral years; but in 1834, their numbers having in creased somewhat by new additions to the \"Cook settlement,\" they were enabled to erect a frame church building; this was dedicated August 16, 1835, Rev. I. N. Walters preaching the dedicatory sermon. This church building is yet standing, and is used by the organization of Grangers as a place of meeting. The second and present church was erected in 1875, being dedicated February 11, 1876; the ser mon on this occasion being preached by Elder Enos Peters, the present pastor. The present condition of this church is a healthy one, the membership being about seventy five. The Sunday-school was organized about 1840, and has been kept up since during the sum mer months of each year. Its present member ship is probably fifty or more. The Methodists early organized a society in the township, though no regular class was formed, so far as can be ascertained, prior to 1840. Meth odist preachers were among the first religious teachers to enter the township, preaching in the cabins of the settlers and in the school-houses. In January, 1840, a class was organized by Rev. Wesley Clark, at the house of John Denty, who is still a resident of the township. The members of this class were George lies, John Denty, David Weyant, A. C. Barber, Frederick lies, Jonathan Clayton, Noah Southard, Ed ward Conner, and some others. The above"], [410, "400 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. members were appointed a committee to purchase land and erect a church tbuilding. The site for this building was selected near the center of the township, on the Hartford and Ho mer road, and near the Otter Fork of Licking. The road from Appleton to Lock also crosses the above road at this church. The first building erected, known as \"Benning ton Chapel,\" was a small, though substantial frame, and, as the work was largely voluntary, and the material, in part, contributed, it only cost about three hundred dollars. During the last year (1880) this building has been enlarged, repaired and fin ished in good style. Mr. George lies died a few years ago, leaving a sum of money, the interest of which was to be used in keeping up the church building, and in beautifying the cemetery grounds adjoining. No regular preaching is now held in this church. A Sunday-school had an existence here at one time, but it is no longer kept up. Both members of the church and pupils in the school, have generally transferred their allegiance to other churches, mostly, perhaps, to the other Methodist churches, of which there are two in the township. These two churches were organized and the buildings erected about the same time \u2014 in the year 1850. One of these, \"Lambert's Chapel,\" is loca ted in the eastern part of the township, a little north of Lake fork, on the farm of Calvin Stout. Among the originators of this organization were Jacob Lambert, Elias Kettle, John Denty and wife, William and Elizabeth Denty, Josiah Shipley and wife, Richard Wells and some others. Prior to the erection of the church, meetings were gener ally held at the house of Jacob Lambert. The present membership is forty or fifty, and a large and active Sunday-school is kept up. The third Methodist Episcopal church in the township is located in Appleton. Rev. Lemuel Yarnell was influential in this organ ization, and thhe first members were Louis Evans, Aaron Shaffer, John Denty, A. C. Barber, Nathan Bigley, David Miller, Martin Light, Richard Wells, and some others. These gentlemen were chosen as a committee to select a site and erect a church building. Rev. Yarnell carried around a subscrip tion paper and obtained money enough to erect a small frame building on the site of the present church. It was erected and dedicated in 185 1. Rev. G. G. West, the pastor in charge, preaching the dedicatory sermon. After several years the old building becoming too small to accommodate the people who gathered there, it was taken away and the present frame building erected. The mem bership of this church is at present about forty. The organization of the Sabbath-school is prob ably coeval with that of the church, and has been kept up in the summer time since; the member ship being now about forty or fifty. Just prior to the late war a church was organized in the northeastern part of the township, mainly through the influence andjpersonal exertions of the Halls \u2014 Gideon Hall and his son John. A small number of Christians were living in this neighbor hood, and felt themselves able to sustain a church. Among the members of the first organization were Gideon Hall and wife, John Hall and wife, John Hilburn and wife, Jacob Rowe and wife, and some others. The church languished during the war, and very nearly went out of existence; but in later years it has revived, and now services are held with considerable regularity, though it is not yet a strong church. A Sunday-school was organized ten or twelve years ago, and has been kept up with considerable regularity, numbering, at present, twenty-five or thirty members. This township also contains a Congregational church, located in the village of Lock. The date of its organization has not been ascertained, but the church is, at present, in a flourishing condition. Messrs. John Dripps, James Sanger, Jesse Smith and Judge John Van Fossen, are remembered as among the most active and best known of the early politicians of this township, the latter serving some years as an associate judge of the common pleas court. Bennington occupies an interior and somewhat isolated position, which may have been instrumental in reducing its population, which for many years was on the decline."], [411, "401 CHAPTER XLIV.

BOWLING GREEN township was organized in 1808. It is eight miles long from east to west, and two and a half miles wide, lying wholly within the Refugee tract. Perry county is on the south, Muskingum on the east, Hopewell and Franklin townships on the north, and Licking on the west. The Mound Builders left a few samples of their works within its limits ; enough to indicate that it was once the home of the lost race. There is a stone mound two and a half miles southeast of Linnville, of medium size, and one earth mound near it, both being near the center of the town ship, east and west. There is also a mound at Amsterdam of no very great dimensions; and an earth mound on the farm of John Hamilton, ad joining Brownsville on the northeast, of oblong form, eighty-five yards in circumference at its base and fifteen feet high. The township has no authentic Indian history, but there is plenty \"of evidence that the Indians roamed freely over it in the pre-historic times, and probably had a more or less permanent occupancy of it. Tradition and the general belief locate the red man on all sides of it, and without doubt_ it was used extensively as a hunting ground .by the Delawares and other nations and tribes that once held undisputed possession here. Agriculturally and topographically considered the township is rolling, or somewhat hilly, although it has some level or bottom lands, very fertile, par ticularly along the little streams which flow through it, southwardly, towards Jonathan's creek, or the Moxahala, as the Indians called it, whose tributa ries they are. It was originally well timbered, the growth being principally oak, hickory and walnut. It is generally fertile, producing corn and the cere als and grass bountifully. There is little, if any, land in the township that is not tillable. All the rain that falls upon its surface flows into the Mus kingum river through the Moxahala. The first settlement of Bowling Green township was made in 1802, at what is called \"Little Bowling Green,\" about a mile south of Linnville, on a trib utary of Jonathan's creek, by some frontiersmen from Western Virginia, whose names were Michael Thorn, Frederick Myers, and Henry Ness. John Harris and Andrew Myers, also Virgini ans, settled here in 1803, and William Harris, Moses Meeks, Adam and John Myers, and Charles How ard in 1804. The latter was a school-teacher by profession, and taught the first school in the town ship. Those who came after 1804, were Edward Tay lor, William Taylor, Joseph Taylor, Jacob Storts, Henry Alexander, John Berry, Joseph McMullin, Rev. Levi Shinn, Nathan Shipps, Elijah Nichols, George Moyer, James Clark, Robert Orr, Landon Warfield, William Chapman, Samuel Parr, Henry Bickell, Alexander McClelland, Walter Roberts, John Weedman, Mr. Mervin, Willis Lake, sr.. \u2014 Longfellow."], [412, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 402 Jacob and Adam Brown, and John Dickinson. Mr. William Harris came to this township in 1804, and, though he lived a while in Franklin township, probably resided more years in this township than any other person. Mr. Solomon Myers was the son of Andrew Myers, one of the 1 immigrants of 1803, and was brought to the \"Little Bowling Green\" from near Morgantown, Monongalia county, western Vir ginia, where he was born in 1788. Settlers continued to flock into the township rapidly, locating themselves in different neighbor hoods, so that when the county was organized in 1808, it was deemed advisable by the county com missioners to organize the people of these several settlements into a separate township. It was the fourth township organized in order of time, and the second after the county was organ ized \u2014 Hanover, only, preceding it. Licking and Granville had been some time organized as town ships in Fairfield county. The little prairie a mile south of Linnville was called \"Little Bowling Green,\" from its resem blance to the Bowling Green on the Licking, four miles below Newark. It gave name to the stream running through it, and thus, also, furnished a name, ultimately, for the township. Samuel Parr, and many other settlers who came to this township before the year 181 5, were from the State of Pennsylvania, mostly from Fayette county. The National road runs through the township from east to west along the northern boundary. It was surveyed, located and constructed between the years 1825 to 1833. \u00abThe towns of Brownsville and Linnville were laid out soon after the final location of the road; the former by Adam Brown, who named it after himself, and the latter by Samuel Parr, who named it after Adam Linn, who was then about to establish himself there as its first mer chant. Biownsville grew rapidly at first, but has been about stationary in later years. It is a post town of about four hundred and fifty inhabitants. Linnville is a post town of about one hundred in habitants. Amsterdam, half of which is in Bowling Green township, was also brought into existence after the location and .during the construction of the Na- tional road, Abraham Boring and George Barnes being its proprietors. The National road for twenty years attracted much travel to it, both of emigrants and general travelers, which gave the villages located upon it an appearance of considerable life and thrift. Reg ular lines of daily four-horse stages were run in those days, and sometimes they had an additional opposition line, carrying on a very vigorous com petition with the regular mail line, which added greatly to the liveliness of the villages along the road. A daily \"Pony Express line,\" also passed over the National road during a portion of the years 1836 and 1837, which, for the time being, increased the excitement and the interest in the villages along the road, and tended to vary the monotony of village life. This pony express was established by Hon. Amos Kendall, the energetic postmaster general, for the purpose of carrying valuable letters, drafts, small packages and impor tant newspaper slips. Its speed was more than ten miles per hour, being twice that of the mail stage; the schedule time from Zanesville to Columbus (fifty-four miles) being five hours, and the postage on matter carried by it was enormously high. Mr. Smucker remembers receiving a newspaper slip, brought by it, containing President VanBuren's in augural address, in March, 1837, on which the postage was seventy-five cents. Such a paper by regular mail would cost two cents. The express ponies were ridden by boys, and put through on a fast gallop, or \"half-run,\" the relays being five miles apart. The small saddle-bags which con tained the express matter were fastened to the sad dle, and, at the end of each run, the saddle and bags were almost instantly transferred from the exhausted, foaming pony, to a fresh one, the rider mounted upon him, and rode away at full speed, with a delay of not more than a minute. The stations in Licking county were Brownsville, Linn vilie, Etniers, Luray, and Etna. A former citizen of Newark, H. S. Manon, and a Mr. Jones, were pony express contractors from Zanesville to Columbus, and Mr. A. B. Duram, of Newark, then a lad living in Brownsville, rode from Zanesville to Etniers, near Jacksontown. He said that he once, in an emergency, rode from Zanes ville to Columbus in three hours and forty-five"], [413, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 4\u00b03 minutes, the rider from Etniers to Columbus be ing sick. Once when behind time he rode from Etniers to Zanesville (twenty-six miles) in less than an hour and a half. There were five relays of horses on his route. The enterprise proving un profitable, was abandoned in 1837. A short time before the Union and Central Pacific railroads were constructed, the pony express was used with success in carrying the mail from the States across the plains and over the mountains to California; and even yet, where the railroad has not penetrated, these pony express lines are used with much ben efit and profit, in the western territories and States. Old settlers look back with a sigh of regret at those stage-coach days, which have passed away forever. When the railroads came into use emi grants, travelers and four-horse coaches, aban doned the pike, and the little towns along the road became dull and ceased to grow. The first religious society organized in Bowling Green township was effected by the Methodists about sixty years ago, at the house of Samuel Parr. Revs. Jesse Stoneman and Levi Shinn preached occasionally, before the organization of this society, at the house of Mr. James Clarke, who lived in the southern part of the township, where, also, a class was formed at an early day. Revs. Asa Shinn, Robert Manley, Ralph Lotspeitch and James Quinn are believed to have preached at Mr. Clarke's in early times. In 1807 Rev. Jesse Stoneman preached a funeral discourse in Bowling Green \u2014 probably the first funeral sermon preached in the township. In 182 1 the society formed at the house of Mr Parr, made an effort to build a hewed log church, which, however, was never completed, and little, i at all, used as a church. About the year 1832 this society erected a small but neat frame church in Linnville, which, after a number of years, theyf sold to the Catholics. In the year 1839 they erected, on a lot adjoining Linnville, the frame structure they yet occupy. The membership is half a hundred or more, and a live Sabbath-school is connected with the church The Methodist Episcopal church in Brownsville is one of the earlier societies. It was first organ ized in 18 1 6 at the residence of Widow Dickinson, one and a half miles north of Brownsville, in Hope- well township, by Rev. James Quinn, where, in 1818, they built a hewed log church which they oc cupied until 1830, when the society was transferred to Brownsville, where they erected a small, brick church. This church was occupied until about thirty-five years ago, when the society erected a large, fine frame edifice, yet occupied. The mem bership numbers something less than one hundred ; and the same may be said of the active and flour ishing Sabbath-school. The Protestant Methodist church, of Browns ville, was organized about 1830, and soon there after built a small frame church. In 1847 they erected a still larger church edifice, which is still occupied. It has very generally been a flourishing and influential church. A large and active Sun day-school is connected with it, and the member ship of the church is something less than one hun dred. About 1840 the Roman Catholics organized a church in Linnville, and bought the small edifice re cently vacated by the Methodist society, who had just completed their new church west of and adjoin ing the town. This Catholic society, after some years, was dissolved, and the church diverted from sacred to secular uses. The Presbyterian church in Brownsville was or ganized by Rev. W. M. Robinson, in 1845, \"W'ith eleven members. The present church edifice, a good brick building, was erected in 1846. Robert Hamilton and William Black were first elders. Mr. Robinson continued preaching several years in this church. At first there were but three or four Presbyterian families, and he received, at this place, less than fifty dollars a year support, yet it' soon became more encouraging, and before he re signed the charge in 1855, he received three hun dred dollars per annum from this congregation which had increased to eighty-four members. Mr. Robinson was succeeded by Revs. W. B. Tidball, H. R. Peairs, Alexander R. Hamilton, L. B. W. Shryock, M. M. Travis, Mr. White, and others. A Sabbath-school has been connected with the church since its organization. \u2022There is a Baptist church about half a mile east of Linnville, erected in 1848, which is part of, or an appendage to the Friendship, or Old School Baptist church at Hog run, in Licking"], [414, "4-04 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. township, whose history is given in the history of that township. The United Brethren have a small church in Amsterdam, which stands on the line between Franklin and this township. The society is small, many of the members having unfted with the society at Jacksontiwn. The Christian Union denomination organized a society in 1865, holding its meeting in a school house in Linnville. The ministers have been Revs. A. S. Biddison, William Henslee, Benjamin Green and Mr. Underwood. They sustain a Sab bath school and pulpit ministrations, with a good degree of regularity. Isaac Orr, James Brown, James Lamp, John P. Switzer, George Clark and John Dusthimer, were among the original mem bers of this church. In addition to the pioneer preachers of Bowling Green already named, are the following: Revs. J. W. Patterson, Jacob Young, Charles Waddle, Mr. McElroy, Abner Goff, Jacob Myers, Joseph Car per, Martin Fate, Mr. McCracken, W. B. Evans, C. Springer, George Brown, George Debolt, James Hooper, Jacob Hooper, Samuel Hamilton, Leroy Swormsted and J. Gilruth. The early-time justices of the peace in this township, were Moses Meeks, Adam Winegardner, John Bartholomew, Alexander Morrison, William Taylor, Charles Bradford, Joseph McMullen, Will iam Armstrong, Samuel Parr and Baltus Emory, who served about in the order named. The township is divided into six school districts, each having a good school building. It is also united with Franklin township in a fractional dis trict. There are but two post offices in the township \u2014 Brownsville and Linnville. The office in each place was established about fifty-years ago, and the postmasters were as follows, about in the order named : Brownsville \u2014 Moses Brotherlin, John F. Bane, George H. Hood, John Oldham, John F. Bane, Alexander Flowers, O. M. Hamilton, John Oldham, George L. Buckingham, O. M. Hamil ton, C. A. Roberts, C. F. Prior and John H. Bell, the present incumbent. Linnville \u2014 Adam Linn, William Tracy, William Orr, David Gilland, Thomas Lonon, David Harris, Summerfield Tip pett, D. C. Harris and W. C. Orr. The number of inhabitants in this township in 1830, was 1,768; in 1840, 1,464; in 1850, 1,538; in 1860, 1,213; in 1880, 926. The large population in 1830 was owing to the fact that many families, who were then engaged in the construction of the National road, had but a temporary residence, and were gone when the cen sus of 1840 was taken; however it will be seen there has been a gradual falling off in population at every census, in which fact lies food for thought. The township vote in presidential elections has been as follows: In 1856, for James Buchanan, 145; for J. C. Fremont, 106; Milliard Filmore, 2. In 1860, Stephen A. Douglas, 138; Abraham Lin coln, 90; J. C. Breckenridge, 15; John Bell, 2. In 1864, George B. McClellan, 147; Abraham Lincoln, 66. In 1868, Horatio Seymour, 162; General Grant, 80. In 1876, Samuel J. Tilden, 164; R. B. Hayes, 69. The totals were, 253, 245, 213; 242, 233. John Yontz and Dr. Walter B. Morris, were among the most conspicuous and influential poli ticians in the township, and both attained to the distinction of representatives in the State legisla ture \u2014 the former in 1835-36-37; and the latter in 1 83 9-40-4 1. They were not early settlers and did not remain in the county many years. The former was identified with the oppositon stage in terest, which kept up such a lively competition with the regular Neil and Moore Ohio mail stage company, for quite a length of time on the Na tional road. His gentlemanly bearing, fine ad dress, remarkable sauvity of manners, affable deportment, and attractive presence, made him exceedingly popular, and gave him great power over his fellows. He died two years ago in California. Dr. Morris moved to Missouri. Bowling Green has, also, furnished a representa tive in the legislature in the person of William Parr, a native of the township. A good degree of thrift and prosperity, the re sult of industry and frugality, have marked the history of the people of Bowling Green township. Their schools and churches, as will be seen, are numerous and well sustained, and the people could not well fail to reach the average standard, in the practice of the higher virtues and Christian graces."], [415, "CHAPTER XLV. BURLINGTON TOWNSHIP. Organization and Location \u2014 Origin of the Name \u2014 Topography \u2014 Works of the Mound Builders \u2014 Pre-Historic Remains\u2014 The Burlington Storm \u2014 The Pioneers \u2014 Homer \u2014 The Churches \u2014 Notable People. THIS township was organized in 1817. It lies on the northern border, adjoining Knox county, between Bennington on the west, Washington on the east, and McKean on the south. It is said that Colonel Wait Wright treated the \"boys\" to two gallons of whiskey for the privilege of naming the township, and thereupon called it after his native place in Vermont. It is well watered \u2014 Otter creek and the North fork, about equal in size, uniting a little above the residence of Justus Taylor, near the vil lage of Homer, the latter taking an easterly course to Washington township. Lake fork rises in Bennington and flows east nearly through the center of Burlington. The surface is gently undulating, except in the district known as \"Egypt,\" in the southeast, which is somewhat hilly. The soil of the larger portion partakes of yellow clay, and is adapted to the growth of wheat and other small grains, which, taken in connection with the alluvial, corn producing bottom land, skirting the streams, creates that variety of soil calculated to invite the agriculturalist. No portion of it is so broken as to prevent cultivation. Within the limits of Burlington are, or were, seven or more of those mysterious mounds for which the county is noted, and which continue to puzzle the antiquarian. One is on the farm formerly owned by Robert Fulton, one mile west of Homer; another on the farm owned by the heirs of John Butcher; and two on the farm formerly owned by Robert Hunter. Mr. Hunter is dead, and the farm is now owned by Jacob Yocum. There were three mounds here, but one of them was plowed away and leveled in the preparation of the ground upon which to build the house, so that two only remain upon this place. 16 ' Under the center of one of these was discovered, some years since, a circular building of stone, about ten feet in diameter and three feet in height, regularly built, dome shaped, and having on the top as a keystone a large stone familiarly known as a \"nigger head.\" Much curiosity was excited as to its contents, but when opened it was found to contain nothing of value. There is another mound on the farm formerly owned by McKnight, one mile west of Utica, which is eight or ten feet in height and twenty-five or thirty feet in diameter at the base. The farm upon which it is located is now owned by James Hanger; but the largest and most entire is at the village of Homer, on the farm and close to the residence of Edwin Will iams, esq.; this has recently been measured and found to be about thirty rods in circumference at the base, and nearly thirty feet in height, having, as is usual, a hollow place at the summit, about twen ty-five feet across. Perhaps fifty years ago, a party of five or six settlers agreed to examine this mound in search of curiosities. They dug down about fifteen feet, but found nothing of value. A mound of ordinary size not long ago had an existence on the farm of Mr. Woodruff, three fourths of a mile west of Homer. This mound has been graded down, but near it yet remains the depression or \"sink\" from which it is believed the dirt was taken for this mound. This place is over grown with bushes, and is sometimes filled with water. The soil in the vicinity of Homer seems to have been favorable for the works of the Mound Build ers, being somewhat sandy. In 1824, near an old fort, the outlines of which are still visible, on the bank of the creek adjoining 4\u00b0"], [416, "406 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. the Homer cemetery, a very large human skeleton was found. It is stated that the jaw-bone would go over the face of the largest man present, with two hands placed between. This might have been some pre-historical Indian chief, and if he wielded influence and power in proportion to his size, he was a mighty man among the red men. In 1815, while digging a mill-race on the western line of the township, some enormous bones were unearthed; among others, a rib over five feet in length; another bone as large around as a wagon hub, and a tooth two and one-half inches broad, one and a half inches thick, and five or six inches in length, doubtless the remains of some antediluvian animal. Mr. William Spencer, speak\" ing in 1876, of the earthwork last mentioned, says it is on the farm of Mr. Joseph Conard, and is a regular circle about eighty-five feet in diameter, with the ditch on the inside of the embankment. It is only twelve or fifteen inches in height, with a gate, or entrance, twelve feet wide, facing the east. The mound in the center of this embankment is at least thirty feet in diameter, thirty inches high, and seems to have always been higher than the circular wall. A few oak trees stand on the embankment, from eighteen inches to two and a half feet in di ameter. No other works are connected with this, so far as can be seen. This earthwork evidently belongs to the same class of works as the \"Old Fort\" near Newark, and known as \"Sacred Inclo sures.\" One of the most important events in the history of this county was the occurrence of what is known as \"The Burlington Storm.\" Its effects were more severely felt in this township than any other, hence its name; and its history may properly be written here. It occurred on the eighteenth of May, 1825, and was one of the most violent tor nadoes ever known in Ohio. The following description of it is from \"Howe's Historical Col lections,\" and the account is believed to be authentic. \" It commenced between the hours of one and two p. m. , in the southeast part of Delaware county. After passing a few miles upon the surface of the ground, in an easterly direction, it appeared to rise so high from the earth that the tallest trees were not affected. It then again descended to the earth, and with greatly increased violence and force, proceeded through the townships of Bennington and Burlington, in Licking county. then passed into Knox, and thence into Coshoeton county. \"It crossed the road from Newark to Mt. Vernon, a short distance above Utica, where its violence was such as to pros trate nearly all the trees, large and small, that stood in its Hack, which was several hundred yards wide. Its general course was a little north of east. For force and violence of wind this storm has rarely been surpassed in any country in the same latitude. Forests and orchards were completely uprooted and leveled; buildings blown down, scattered in every direction, and carried by the force of the wind many miles distant; cattle were taken from the ground and carried one hundred rods or more. The creek, which had been swollen by recent rains, had but little water in its bed after the storm passed. The roads and fields recently plowed were quite muddy from recent rains; but, after the storm passed by, both roads and fields were clean and dry. Its track through Licking county was from one-third to three-fifths of a mile wide, but became wider as it advanced to the eastward. Those who were so fortunate as to be wit nesses of its progress, without being victims of its fury, repre sent the appearance of fragments of trees, buildings and limbs, high in the air, to resemble large numbers of birds, such as buzzards and ravens. \"The ground also seemed to tremble, as is asserted by many credible persons, who were at the time a mile from the track of the tornado. The roar of the wind, the trembling of the ground, and the crash of falling timbers and building, are represented by all who were witnesses as being peculiarly dreadful.\" Colonel Wright, and others who witnessed its progress, think it advanced at the rate of a mile per minute, aud did not last more than a minute and a half or two minutes. The cloud was ex ceedingly black, and sometimes bore hard upon the ground, and at others seemed to rise a little above the surface. One peculiarity was that the fallen timber lay in every direction, so that the course of the storm could not be determined from the position of the fallen trees. Many incidents are related by the inhabitants, calculated to illustrate the power and terrors of the storm. A chain, three or four feet long, of the size of a plow-chain, was taken from the ground near the house of John McClintock, carried about half a mile, and lodged in the top of a sugar-tree stub about twenty-five feet from the ground. An ox belonging to Colonel Wait Wright, was carried about eighty rods, and left unhurt, although surrounded by fallen timber so that it required several hours chopping to release him. A cow, also, was taken from the same field, carried about forty rods, and lodged in the top of a tree, which was blown down, and when found, was dead, and about eight feet from the ground. Whether the cow was blown against the tree-top after it fell, or sures.\""], [417, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 407 was lodged in it before, could not be determined. A heavy ox-cart was taken from the yard of Colonel Wright, carried about forty rods, and struck the ground with such force as to break the axle, and entirely demolish one wheel. A son of Colonel WTright, upwards of fourteen years of age, was standing in the house, holding the door. The house which was built of logs, was torn to pieces, and the lad thrown with such vio lence across the room as to kill him instantly. A coat hanging in the same room, was found the following November in Coshoeton county, more than forty miles distant, and was afterward brought to Burlington and identified by Colonel Wright's family. Other articles, such as shingles, pieces of timberand furniture, were carried twenty and thirty miles. Miss Sarah Robb, about twelve years of age, was taken from her father's house, and carried some distance. She could not tell how far; but when consciousness returned, found herself about forty rods from the house, and walking toward it. She was much bruised, but not very greatly injured. The family of a Mr. Vance, on seeing the storm approaching, fled from the house to the orchard adjoining. The upper . part of the house was blown off and through the orchard, the lower part remaining. Two sons of Mr. Vance were killed, one immediately, and the other died in a day or two from wounds; these and the son of Colonel Wright were all the lives known to have been lost in the storm. A house built of large logs, in which was a family, and which a number of workmen had entered for shelter from the storm, was raised up on one side, and rolled off the spot where it stood, without injuring any one. A yoke of oxen belonging to William H. Cooley, were standing in the field, and after the storm, were found com pletely enclosed and covered with fallen timber, so that they were not released until the next day, but were not essentially injured. A black walnut tree, two and a half feet in diameter, which had lain on the ground many years, and become embedded in the earth to nearly one-half its size, was taken from its bed, carried across the creek, and left about thirty rods from its former location. A crockery crate, in which several fowls were confined, was carried by the wind several miles, and, sttange to relate, with its contents set down without injury. Instances could be multiplied, but it is unneces sary; the evidence is clear that it was one of the most violent storms on record. The first settlers in the township, as nearly as can now be ascertained, were James Dunlap, Cor nelius Vanausdal, Henry Oldacre, Nathan Conard, John Johnson, Jonathan Beaty, Hugh McKindley, Adam Patterson, John Dixon and Thomas Dixon in 1806; David Wallace, J. Helphry, Jesse Van Fossen, John Chonner, James Butcher, James Dickey and Jesse Smith in 1808; George McCrary, Timothy Chapman, James, John and Abner Mc- Lain, Thomas Scott and Henry McKindley about 1 8 10; and a little later Wait Wright, Samuel Ed mon, Adam Patterson, Van Simmons, Thomas Bare and Ezra Mead. In 1806 the wolves and bears were in the ma jority. In 1810 the settlers erected a block-house as a defence against the Indians. It was on \"Indian path,\" near the Dunlap residence, on the road from Utica to Johnstown. John Chonner built the first mill in the township and taught the first Sabbath-school, and was a lead. ing citizen. The village of Homer was'originally called Bur lington; but when the post office was established it was found necessary to change its name, and the present name was chosen. It was laid out by John Chonner in 18 16, and now contains about three hundred inhabitants; has a large school-house, three churches, two dry goods stores, kept by S. L. Blue and Elmer Scott, two hotels, two blacksmith shops, one wagon shop, one cabinet shop, and the usual number of mechanical establishments. The Congregational church (now Presbyterian) was organized May 5, 1828, by Rev. Jacob Little, of Granville. The examining committe were Dea con Amasa Howe, of Granville, Deacon Orin Barnes, of St. Albans, Deacon Eliseus Fowler, of Hartford, and Samuel W. Rose, of Granville, a licentiate of Lancaster presbytery, who was its first minister. They have a good membership, a flour ishing Sabbath-school, and a neat, commodious house of worship. This church is not strong, the present membership being twenty or more. Their"], [418, "4o8 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. The Methodists held their early meetings in the cabins of the members, and afterward in the log school-houses that began, soon after the first settle ment, to spring up here and there all over the country. Their first church edifice in this town ship was erected about 1834, and cost about one thousand dollars. This building was in use nearly thirty-five years. The congregation began the erection of the present church in 1868, and it was dedicated June 25, 187 1, by Rev. M. Collyer. It isa substantial structure, large, handsome, well finished, and furnished in the most approved modern style, and cost about twenty-five hundred dol lars. They have a membership of seventy-five, a good Sabbath-school, numbering one hundred pupils, and the church is in a prosperous condi tion. For many years the preachers to this class were the itinerant ministers sent out by the church conference, who had regular preaching places in various parts of this and other counties. Among the original members of the class were Thomas Callihan, Benjamin Belt, David Weiant, Solo mon Wheeler, Nathan Conard, Isaac Vanosdoll, David Watson, Henry Overholt, and James Houck. Homer was the native place of Major General William S. Rosecranz, his father residing here as farmer, merchant and tavern keeper. It is also the home of the venerable William Knowles, a poet of considerable ability. first church building stood where the Union school house now stands. It was then Old School Presby terian. Subsequently it united with the new school, and they erected the present building. The Baptist church edifice was finished July 9, 1832, and dedicated July 21, 1832, by Rev. Owen Owens. They formerly had a large membership, but many families have removed, and their places have not been filled; they are now compar atively few in number. The original members of this church organization were John Esthell, Titus Knox, Benjamin Warner, Lewis Hatch, Mabel Thrall, Mariah Smith, Mary Woods, Ruth Warner,. Mary Emerson, Mary Pugh, Susannah Hatch, Peggy A. Knox, Elizabeth Galer, Peter Galer, Leonard Woods, Barbara Wheeler, Jacob Galer, Daniel Galer, Eliza Hard, Mary Esthell, Ann Tellis, Elizabeth Tellis, Elizabeth Warner, Howard Phillips, Elizabeth Phillips, and David Brown. The first church building was erected soon after the church was organized. It was a frame building, and was occasionally added to and repaired. It is yet standing, and is used for a carpenter shop. The present building, a frame, was erected about thirty years ago. It has recently been repaired and painted. Services are held here every two weeks. The membership is about thirty three. This is what is known as New School Baptist, which admits the Sunday school as part of their religious worship.

Long run, one of the larger tributaries of the Rocky fork in this township, rises in its northeast ern corner, and flowing south along its eastern border, joins the Rocky fork in the northern part of Mary Ann township. Lost run rises in the southwestern part of this township, several branches of it uniting near the United Brethren church, and flowing south in Mary Ann township. A high range of hills passes across the township from northwest to southeast in its western part, dividing the waters of the Rocky fork from those of Lost run and the North fork of Licking. The springs before mentioned are more numerous in this town ship than in any other in the county, with the pos sible exception of Fallsbury. The natural scenery is picturesque, and in many places on the Rocky fork approaches the sublime. About one mile north of the south line of Eden, on either side of the road, like two grim sentinels, stand the \"Picture rocks,\" in the midst of scenery so wild and rugged as to attract pleasure parties from Newark and other places. Rocky fork is appropriately named. Exclusive of the regular mountain ranges, scenery so wild and rugged will seldom be found. All along this stream through Mary Ann and Eden, in every successive mile, the beholder is filled with wonder and amazement at the new and varied phases of Nature's face. Coming up from the south along this stream, over a narrow, winding mountain road, these Picture rocks seem, as it were, to be the \"cap sheaf\" of all the rugged beauty below; yet this mountainous scenery continues through the entire township along this stream. Turning to the right a little south of Picture rocks, a narrow, winding by-road leads over the hills of Long run, 409 \"Rugged as Time's early dawn, Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun.\" EDEN township lies in the northeastern part of the county and is essentially a township of farmers, there being no town within its limits. It is well watered by the Rocky fork and its tributaries, the main body of which stream passes diagonally across the township from north to south, near its center. If any works of the Mound Builders existed in this township, they have almost, if not entirely, disap peared. The soil was not well adapted to the erection of their works, being composed of rocks and clay. This mysterious people clung closely, it appears, to sandy, loamy soil, in the erection of their works. No Indian history has been handed down, but tradition has it that the Indians encamped on the Bowling Green used this as a hunting ground. The \u00a3ace of the country is broken and hilly, in some places assuming the dignity and grandeur of mountains; the valleys are generally narrow and very fertile. In its primitive state the oak predom inated in the forest, considerable chestnut was also found, and the valleys were occupied by sugar and shell-bark hickory; and the entire township was covered with fruits, flowering shrubs, and trees of smaller growth. The abundance of fruits, nuts, and wild game, made it desirable hunting ground, and rendered it comparatively easy for the pioneers to support their families until the forest should be cleared away. There are a great number of springs in every direction, bursting from the hillsides, and the water flowing from these form a network ot small streams; these form the creeks which, after flowing in tortuous courses through narrow valleys find"], [420, "4io HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. In its primitive condition, before the heavy hand of man was laid upon its timber and soil, this town ship must have been a perfect Garden of Eden for the hunter both red and white. Game of every des cription was plenty and continued to be plenty long after it was driven out of the more desirable parts of the county. Wild animals found a sure_and safe retreat among these hills and rocks. The township was organized in 1822, out of ter ritory originally included in Mary Ann. The pioneers were William Shannon, Jesse Old aker and Ebenezer Brown, who settled in the west half of the township in the spring of 1813. Shan non came from Franklin county Pennsylvania; Old aker from the Shenandoah Valley, and Brown from Washington county, Pennsylvania. These formed the nucleus of what is now Eden township. They were soon followed by Homeward Mariott, William Mitchell, Aaron Brown, Robert McLaughlin, James Starrest, Rev. James Cunningham, James Porter, Charles McFadden, Elisha McFadden, James W. Colville, Jordan Hall, David Moats and W. Henthorn. The erection of a grist mill-on the upper waters of the Rocky fork, by Ebenezer Brown, at a very early period, soon followed by the erection of another one mile below, by Honorable William Mitchell, were noteworthy events, and contributed largely to the comfort and convenience of the early settlers of Eden, Mary Ann, and portions of Knox county. The Mitchell mill is yet running, having changed hands several times. It is now owned by John Stevenson. Quite a number of mills, both saw- and grist-mills, have been erected at various places along the Rocky fork, in this township; few are now, however, in running order. This stream furnished very good mill-power, and seldom went dry, as it is fed largely by springs. About 1854, a woollen factory was erected by Walter B. Finney, about a mile below the Mitchell mill. It was in operation about seven years when it was destroyed by fire. Mr. Finney, who is yet living, also erected a saw-mill in connection with his woollen factory, which is yet running. A mill also had an existence in an early day near the Long Run post office, in the eastern part of the township, but its wheels have not been turning for some years. and in a short time \"Rain rock\" is reached. This is a spot of much natural beauty. Nothing of special importance is observed from the roadway, which passes directly over the top of Rain rock. Descending into a gloomy gorge, filled with trees and flowering shrubs, with huge sand-rocks piled promiscuously about on the hill-sides, a place that can only be reached by a footman, the Rain rocks and their accompaniments come into view. This is merely a huge, seamed sand rock that juts from the hill-side, over which the road passes, extending into the gorge thirty or forty feet, its under surface, so much of it as can be seen, being about one hundred feet long by thirty or forty feet wide. This surface appears elevated, at the highest part, some twenty feet or more above the surface of the ground beneath, but sloping slightly until it rests upon a solid wall of sand rock that supports it. It forms a gloomy, cavernous-looking excavation, and a shel ter where a hundred people or more might escape from a storm. In various places through the crev ices of this rock-roof, clear, sparkling spring water issues, and keeps up an incessant dropping, year after year, upon the sand beneath, hence the name Rain rock. In winter this dropping water forms icicles, often reaching from the ground to the sur face of the rock, making very beautiful pyramids of ice. This is also a pleasure resort. Pleasure parties from Newark and other places sometimes camp out here for days, and ramble about among these picturesque hills. Meetings of various kinds are also held here, and rude plank seats are here ar ranged for the accommodation of an audience in front of which, and at a little distance from Rain rock, is a flat rock, four or five feet high, and ten or twelve feet in diameter accross the top, with a smooth surface, known as \"Pulpit rock,\" upon which the speaker stands, and upon which several chairs may be placed for the accommodation of distinguished visitors. In rear of the \"Audience room\" and fronting Pulpit rock, is a huge mass of perpendicular rocks. These are \"rent and riven\" as by thunder bolts; the interstices being filled with laurel bushes, and the edges rimmed with ferns, causing this mass of rocks, during the proper sea son, to look like an immense flower-pot. It is al together a very pretty and healthful resort."], [421, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 4ii The first road through this township was, prob ably, the old State road, now known as the Mar tinsburgh and Newark road, which passes across the township from north to south on the west side of the Rocky fork, and was much used in early days by travelers from Newark to Mt. Vernon, Martinsburgh and points further north. Coal crops out in places among the hills in the vicinity of Rocky fork, but has not yet been found in workable veins. It has been stated that there were no villages in this township, and this is, probably, the case, though some attempts have been made in this direction. James Shannon undertook to build a town in the northwestern part of the township, on the Rocky fork, in the vicinity of a very small lake, about 1856. He erected a store-room, put in a stock of goods, and called the place Oberlin. At tempts were also made to get a regular post office, but without success, though letters are left at the store for people in that neighborhood. This store has been conducted at different times by different parties, but during the past year (1880) it was destroyed by fire. A new building, however, has been erected and the store continued. In addition to this, there is a blacksmith shop, kept by John Hughes, and three or four dwellings. There was also a store on the farm of Elzey Dush about twenty years ago, in the eastern part of the town ship. There is also a cluster of houses here \u2014 three or four. The second regular post office in the township was established in 1858, by James W. Colville, who was the first postmaster. It was kept in his dwell ing house, where it is yet kept, his son being the present postmaster. This is the Long Run office. There is no town there \u2014 nothing but Mr. Colville's residence, the church, and ruins of the old mill. Probably the first school taught in this township was by James Cunningham, near the north line of the township, a short distance from Oberlin, in an old deserted building that had been erected for a tannery. The first school-house erected in the township was probably the one that stood near the Rocky fork, about a mile southeast of Oberlin. It was a rude, round log building, and James Cun ningham kept the first school in it. The township is now dotted over with school-houses, the people having learned that in these and the churches lie the only hope of the Republic. Eden has furnished to the county two surveyors, William Anderson and James R. Anderson, a com missioner, Jordan Hall, and a representative, Wil liam Mitchell. There are four churches in this township, two United Brethren, one Disciple and one Protestant Methodist. The Disciple church was organized in 1829, and was the first church organization of that society in Licking county. It was organized in the log school-house known as the \"Henthorn school youse,\" situated about four miles south of where, in 1834, a fine frame church edifice was erected on the farm of Benjamin Bell, in Knox county. The church was erected on the line between Knox and Licking counties. The first disciple preaching in the county was by Elder James Porter at this place in 1829, by whom, also, this congregation was organized. He was also its first elder, and for some time its ablest and almost only public advocate. He resided in the vicinity, and perhaps to him more than to any other man, the organization is indebted for its origin, advancement, and present standing and in fluence in the community. The members of its first organization were James Porter and wife, Benjamin .Bell, sr., and wife, Elizabeth Bell (wife of Samuel Bell), Stephen Harris and wife, Isaac Henthorn and wife, and Elisha Stout. About 1830 a public discussion took place in a log barn belonging to Jesse Oldacre, between Rev. James Gilruth, of the Methodist Episcopal church, and elder James Porter, on behalf of the Disciples. After this discussion, which seemed to arouse much interest, the congregation grew rapidly in numbers, and subsequently under the ministerial labors of such evangelists as James Porter, John Secrist, John Reed, Reuben Davis, John Sargent, James Mitchell, Jesse B. Ferguson, Arthur Critch field, James J. Moss, Dr. William Hayes, David G. Mitchel, J. H. Jones, Isaiah Jones, Andrew Burns, Abner Lemert, Benjamin Bell, jr., David Sharpless, David Weaver, Jonas Hartzel,Ziba Brown, and many others, members were added until the member ship reached more than one hundred and fifty."], [422, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 412 Benjamin Bell, jr., upon whom as teacher and elder, rested for ten or twelve years the almost ex clusive control of the church, deserves much credit for his efficiency and faithfulness. In 1S73 tn's society erected a church in the western part of the township, called Eden chapel. The building is a very good one, and the society strong in numbers and active. They also maintain an active Sabbath-school. On the opposite side of the road from this church is the old burying ground, upon which was erected one of the first churches in the county, but which has gone out of existence, this Disciple church taking its place. The United Brethren are strong in this township, keeping up two churches, and near this place one of their first societies was organized, in the cabin of one of the members. This organization of United Brethren, however, never obtained a firm hold here, but by the help of the few Methodists in the neighborhood, erected in an early day, a log church, used occasionally by both denominations, when they were able to secure a minister. The United Brethren organization did not probably continue here more than six or seven years; they were not-able to support a minister, and when the Pleasant Valley church was organized, in the south ern part of the township, they attended there and gave the old log up entirely to the Methodists. The most influential members in the Methodist Episcopal organization were the Oldacres, two or three families of whom resided in that vicinity. Jesse Oldacre was prominent and influential in es tablishing the church and keeping it up, hence it soon came to be known as the \"Oldacre church.\" The principal members of the original organiza tion of this Methodist class were Jesse Oldacre and wife, William Shannon and wife, William Oldacre and wife, H. B. Oldacre and wife and Margaret Wilkins. After the death of Jesse Old acre and the removal of others of the members from the neighborhood, the church languished. The old log church building was probably erected about 1848, or before. As before stated the Dis ciple church has taken the place, in this neighbor hood, of the other two denominations. The Pleasant Valley United Brethren church is located in the southern part of the township on the old State road, now the Newark and Martins- burgh road, on the head-waters of Lost Run, and is one of the oldest churches in the county; hav ing been organized about 1820, or before. Rev. Joshua Montgomery was probably instrumental in the organization of this church, and was, probably, its first minister. As no records were kept for many of its earlier years, it is hard to get correct data as to its earliest history; but prior to the erec tion of the church building, the members proba bly held their meetings at the cabin of John Neigh barger, who was one of its earliest and most prominent members. William Shannon and wife also belonged to this church in its earlier years. The old log church built fifty years ago, or more, was known as the \"Montgomery chapel,\" and answered all purposes of a church for forty years, or more. The present neat frame building was erected about 1869. The present membership of this church is about forty. The Sunday-school was organized at an early day, and has been maintained with considerable regularity, now numbering forty or fifty members. In later years, about 1855, a second United Brethren church was organized in this township, called \"Edwards' meeting-house.\" John Edwards, the Phillipses and some others were the principal movers in its establishment. The church, a frame building, was erected about 1856, in the eastern part of the township, on Long run, on Mr. Ed wards' farm, and is frequently called the Long Run church. Preaching and a Sunday-school are main tained with considerable regularity. The Protestant Methodist church located in the southern part of the township, a mile or more northeast of the United Brethren church, was organized about 1857. Stephen Miles, deceased, was the founder of this church. He and his brother William, Washington Holten, Jacob Sous land and some others were the first members of this organization. They held their meetings at first in the school-house, but erected the present church building in 1858. Rev. Hoagland was probably their first minister. This is now a strong, active church, with a membership of fifty or more. Ten years after the erection of the church, a Sabbath-school was organized, and is maintained with considerable success, the average attendance being forty or fifty."], [423, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 413 This township is, at this time, divided into farms of ordinary size; is pretty well cleared and fenced, though much of its surface, especially along the Rocky Fork, will probably never be made capable of cultivation. Much of its primitive'beauty and grandeur will remain while time lasts, to delight the eye of the traveler. CHAPTER XLVII. ETNA TOWNSHIP. Location\u2014 Topography\u2014 First Settlers and Settlements\u2014 Organization\u2014 Township Officers\u2014 Etna\u2014 Wagram\u2014 The Churches. ETNA township is located in the southwestern corner of the county, and wholly in what was known as the \"Refugee Lands.\" This is a township of good farming land, and is drained by the tributaries of the South fork of Licking and of the Scioto river. The former stream passes across the northeast corner and sends its branches through the eastern part of the township, nearly to its center. The western part is well watered by the head-waters of Black Lick creek and Sycamore creek, the latter passing en tirely across the township, flowing south into the Little Walnut, whose waters join with those of the Scioto a few miles above Circleville. The tribu taries of the Black Lick in this township bear to the southeast, and the waters find their way through the Big Walnut to the Scioto. Beyond the town of Etna is a ridge passing diagonally across the township from northwest to southeast, dividing the waters of the Scioto and Licking. There are no railroads in the township, but the National road passes through it from east to west, and upon this are located two towns \u2014 Wagram and Etna \u2014 within the township limits. This territory, lying as it did far from the usual route of pioneer travel, was not settled untill 1815. About that date John Williams settled on what has since been known as the Matthews farm. Several families of the Nelsons; John Crouch; Jacob, Peter and George Houser; Messrs. Parkin son, Bergman, Heffner, Denison, Gary, Drake, and John and David Herron, all began clearing the land before 1816. Isaac Essex was a settler of 1816. Settlers continued to come in slowly until 1833, when the township was organized \u2014 being the last township organized in the county \u2014 and the first election held at the house of John Henthorn, in Etna, June 2 2d of that year. R. O. Baldwin, John Nelson and Benjamin Grable were elected the first trustees; John Henthorn, clerk; N. R. Usher, treasurer; William Smith and George Wells, constables; Richard Lamson, George Wells, William Moore and Hiram Sinsabaugh, supervi sors; Thomas M. Donahue and Isaac Essex, over seers of the poor, and Henry Spangler, Jonathan Grable and Dennis Smoke, fence viewers. These were all prominent and influential men in the township during their lives. As originally laid out, Etna was nine and a half miles long from east to west and two and a half miles wide; but some time after 1850, one-half mile was taken off the east end and added to Har rison township. By the township records, it appears that the trustees divided the township into five school dis tricts, and into four road districts, March 3, 1834. At that time the United States government was constructing the National road. John Henthorn was then acting justice of the peace; Ambrose Meeker, Benjamin Grable and Jonathan Glen denning, township trustees; Robert Clum, clerk; Tracy Scott, treasurer, and Henry Niswander, Hiram Buell and John Murphy fence viewers."], [424, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 414 Buell was a doctor, and \"Jack\" Murphy was a \"man-of-wars-man\" and a noted character in his day. Continuing the examination of the township records, the following entry is found : \"May 30, 1834. \"We, the trustees of Etna township, found a vacancy in the office of overseer of the poor of said township ; have met, and do appoint Thomas Marshall to fill said vacancy. Given urder our hands the day and year above written. Benjamin Grable, Ambrose Meeker, Trustees. Served by reading. Fees, ten cents. John Snider, Constable. June 5, 1834.\" The charges of Constable Snider, compared with those of the present day, are somewhat aston ishing. \"September 22nd, the trustees met at the office of John Hen thorn to appoint a constable to fill the vacancy occasioned by the death of John Snider, and the doctor, Hiram Buell, received the appointment. \"November nth of the same year, Moses Cheney was ap pointed constable as successor to Dr. Buell, who, through sick ness or inability, was unable to perform the duties of the office. \"On the sixth of April, 1835, the following civil officers were elected in this township : Henry Spangler, Richard Lamson and Benjamin Grable, trustees ; Robert Gum, clerk ; Tracy Scott, treasurer; Moses Cheney and Thomas H. Stewart, constables. The supervisors were, No. 1, Adam Egolf ; No. 2, Basil Brown; No. 3, Moses Cheney ; No. 4, Richard Lamson ; No. 5' Henry Niswander. The overseers of the poor were John Hen thorn and Thomas Marshall, and the fence viewers were- William Mitchell, jr., George Maxfield and Jacob Shaff.\" Richard Lamson was commissioned a justice of the peace, October 19, r835, which office he held, in connection with that of postmaster, with credit to himself and the community, until the infirmities of age obliged him to relinquish them; probably about 1848. The town of Carthage \u2014 since called Etna \u2014 was laid out by Lyman Terrell, its original proprietor, in 1832. The National road was then in process of construction, and it was laid out upon its propos ed line, it being finished to this point in 1833-4. Like many other towns laid out upon this great thoroughfare it had \"great expectations,\" which, however, as in the case of most other towns upon the road, were not realized. Settlers followed the line of the road rapidly, and soon filled up the towns and townships along the line. It required a large amount of money to build the road, and no inconsiderable portion of this was spent among the inhabitants, and was considered almost a God send, that article being extremely scarce in those days. Great impetus was given to building in the small towns, and from the fact that it was supposed that travel would immediately become so great as to require unlimited accommodations, in Etna nearly every other house was designed for a \"tavern.\" It was expected much would be realized from the sale of lots, etc., the desire for money-making and speculation being about the same as that created by the new railroads of the present day. In 1834 this little town was visited by the chol era, which made sad havoc, nearly or quite depop ulating the place. Among its victims were Daniel Warner, who was then keeping store; O. R. Bald win, also a merchant; Dr. Buell, Mr. Smith, and others. The towns along this road, on account of the great travel by all classes, nations, and condi tions of people, were more liable to be visited by contagious diseases than those away from the line of the road. Etna received another terrible visita tion in 1845, at time from the small-pox, the treatment of which, at that time, was not as well understood as at the present day. Much suffering and a number of deaths resulted. It was much to the credit of Jacob Shaff and Henry Warner that they exerted themselves with considerable success in relieving this suffering. The coming of the railroad stopped the growth of Etna and all other towns along the' National road. It now has something less than three hun dred inhabitants. Wagram, first called Cumberland, was laid out by Jerry Armstrong about the same time Etna came into existence, or a little before. He tried hard to make something out of it by leading roads from many directions into it, but failed. A few dwellings, a store and post office, were about the sum of what was accomplished toward building a town. A respectful deference has always been paid to the subject of religion; harmony and good will always exisiting between the different denomina tions, and reasonable support given to each. In fact, the township, for its size, is better supplied with churches than most others in the county May 30, 1834. Trustees. John Snider, Constable. June 5, 1834.\""], [425, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 4iS there being five at present within its limits, viz.: Methodist Episcopal, United Brethren, Disciple, Reformed, and Albright. The Methodists were the earliest to hold ser vices in this township, as in most other townships in the county. It is believed that the first religious services in the township were held by this denomi nation in the cabin of Mr. Jacob Conine, about 1819 or 1820. A society was organized here, which continued its meetings, mostly in Mr. Co nine's cabin, until Etna was laid out in 1832, when the meeting place was transferred to the school house in that place. Mr. Conine's cabin stood near to and on the south side of the South fork of Lick ing, and in the northern part of the township. Among the first members of this organization were Thomas Donahue, Esquire Swain, Jacob Co nine, wife and daughter, Sarah Herron, and a few others. From this small beginning sprang the present Methodist church of Etna village. The old frame church in the village, in which meetings were held more than thirty-five years, was erected about 1835, or not long, at least, after the town was laid out. The present church, a fine brick edifice, was erected in 187 1, and cost about seven thous and five hundred dollars. At present the mem bership of this church is about thirty-five. Mr. Jacob F. Conine thus writes regarding this church. He probably refers to the first organization in the town of Etna. ; \"The Methodist Episcopal chnrch must have had a society formed here as early as 1830. I find minutes of a first organi zation in July 13, 1836, when Thomas Donahue, Jonathan Grable, and Edward Brown, a majority of the old board pres ent, and Uriah Heath, jr., preacher, b:ing present by appoint ment of the preacher in charge. At this meeting John D. Shank, David Anderson, Lyman Terrel, Amos Hart, and Edwin Adams, were nominated and approved trustees of the Methodist Episcopal meeting house lot ; and Dr. David An derson was appointed as secretary to the board, or iecording trustee. At the same meeting Thomas Donahue, Lyman Ter rel, and Amos Hart were appointed a building committee. On the eleventh of July following, at a meeting of the trustees it was moved and seconded, ' That any two of the trustees of this meeting-house shall have power to grant the liberty of the house to any minister of the gospel, of good and regular standing in his own church, who holds to the divinity of Jesus Christ and the direct influence of the Holy Spirit, and only to the commonly received Bible as the revelation of God, and who believes in future rewards and punishments, at such time as there is no Methodist appointment.' Lyman Terrel was the author of this resolution, and it was carried by a unanimous vote.\" The first Sabbath-school in Etna was a union school, organized in Etna village. Children of all denominations attended it, but, about 1841, the Methodists organized a school of their own, which has been continued ever since. This school is ac tive and vigorous at present, with a membership of fifty or more. Although there is no Presbyterian church in this township, Presbyterianism had a start here soon after Etna was laid out. Rev. Timothy W. Howe, who was for many years a resident of this township, in his paper upon the Presbyterian churches in this part of the county, thus writes of early Presbyterianism in this township: \"Rev. C. Putnam, of jersey, preached in Carthage (Etna), November 18, 1832, in a hewed log house a few rods north of the village. This was unquestionably the first sermon by a Presbyterian in Etna. Rev. Jacob Tuttle came from New Jer sey in 1832, and commenced preaching in Lima, Harrison and Etna in the spring of 1833, and continued to do so more or less regularly until the spring of 1837. He was highly esteemed, and his memory is cherished by his neighbors and friends. \"From Mr. Putnam's diary, I learn that March 10, 1833, he preached at Lima in the morning and at Etna in the evening. Again, September 2, 1834,. Mr. Putnam attended the funeral of Messrs. Daniel Warner and Oliver K. Baldwin, in Etna, of the arm of Warner, Baldwin & Co. , who died the day previous within twelve hours of each other, and were buried at the same *ime. \"Another note, under date of January 26, 1835, says; 'Funer al at Etna of Freeman Howe; aged twenty-four; sick nine days; friends all in New Hampshire. His made the twenty seventh grave in a yard where there were only three graves be fore the burial of Messrs. Warner and Baldwin, in September previous.' That was the year in which the cholera swept off so many in Etna. \"October 14, 1838, Rev. T. W. Howe commenced his labors in the South Fork church. No house of worship was owned by the Presbyterians at that time; only one family connected with the Presbyterian church at that time lived in a frame dwelling house; the others lived in cabins. The meetings were held the first year in the Methodist Episcopal church in Etna, in the frame school-house at the northwest corner of Kirkers ville, and at the log school-house near Mr. S. D. Alward's. After the first year in Etna, Presbyterians used the house built by the United Brethren, because the Presbyterians assisted them in building it. For eleven years it was thus occupied every other Sabbath in the afternoon. \"The Presbyterians and United Brethren in Christ, in 1842, formed a union Sabbath-school in Etna. The first ,ear that school averaged seventy-five pupils the year round. The school continued in a very prosperous state for nine years, while the Presbyterians preached in the United Brethren church. This school is still sustained.\" Presbyterians, however, did not get a sufficient hold in Etna to enable them to erect a church or 'continue their organization within its limits. Gen-"], [426, "4i6 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. erally, the few Presbyterians followed Mr. Howe over to the South Fork church. Mr. Howe is still living in Pataskala, having retired from ministerial labor. He is much respected by the community. The United Brethren church, of which Mr. Howe speaks, is located in Etna. It is a frame building and was erected in 1838, by the united efforts of the United Brethren and Presbyterians. The latter, however, owned no share in it, but had the use of it by contract when not in use by the United Brethren. Rev. David Edwards was prob ably the first minister to preach in this church for the United Brethren, and Samuel Hively, Daniel Snyder, and James and Ebenezer Drake and their mother, Mrs. Drake, were among the first mem bers of this church. The Sunday-school in this church, as mentioned by Mr. Howe, was organized in 1842, and still continues in a prosperous condition. The Reformed church of Etna is located on what is known as the \"Basil road,\" in the southern part of the township, about three miles southwest of Kirkersville, and the same distance southeast of Etna village. Prior to 1834, the few members of this denom ination, mostly Germans, held meetings in their houses, but sometime during that year, the Rev. David Wise came into the neighborhood, and, assisted by Jacob Reef, Jacob Shearer, David Keller and a few others, organized a church. Jacob Reef and Jacob Shearer were the first elders. In the fall of this year the society erected a log church upon the site of the present building, and the dedicatory sermon was preached by Mr. Wise, who continued as pastor of this church until 1854. The old church was taken away and the present comfortable building erected in 1869. The pres ent membership of this society is about seventy. The Sunday-school was organized in 1840, and is yet sustained, with a membership of forty-five. Near the above church is located the Albright, or \"The Emanuel Church of the Evangelic Order.\" This church was organized in 1875, by Rev. S. E. Rife, in a school-house on the same road upon which the church building stands. The following are among the original members of this organiza tion: John Hoffer and wife, John N. Born and wife, Samuel Ammon and wife, Miss Susan Am mon and Miss Pauline Ammon, Jacob Scheidger and wife, Father Switzer, Mrs. Phipps and two daughters, and a few others. Prior to the erection of the church, meetings were held in the Rees school-house every four weeks. The present ex cellent church edifice was erected during the sum mer and fall of 1875, at a cost of two thousand dollars; and was dedicated by Bishop Yost, No vember 21, 1875. Rev. Rife continued to hold services until the spring of 1877, when he was succeeded by Rev. Mr. Hankey, who, in turn, was succeeded, in 1879, by the present pastor, Rev. Mohn. The present membership of this church is about fifty-four. The Sunday-school was organized in the spring of 1876, with about seventy pupils. It has been continued since, and now averages about seventy members. Jacob Smoke is super intendent. The Campbellite or Disciple church is located on what is called York street, two-and-a-half miles east of Kirkersville, near the northern line of the township, on the South fork. In May, 1853, the congregation was organized by William Hayes and John C. Winter; it consisted of sixteen mem bers, who met every Sabbath in the \"Pine school house,\" on York street. The members of this organization were Jacob and Eliza Winter, Abra ham and Jane Morrow, Jacob and Isabella Stoolfire, Noah and Mary Morrow, Nathan and Mary Mc- Vay, John and Eliza Crow, Daniel Stoolfire, Cath arine McVay, Elizabeth Hoyt and Hannah Crow. The officers chosen for this organization were Jacob Winter and Abraham Morrow, elders; Jacob Stoolfire and Noah Morrow, deacons, and, April 15, 1854, Nathan McVay, Jacob Stoolfire and David Stoolfire, trustees. The present church edifice was erected in the spring of 1855, and in September of the same year the building was dedi cated by Alexander Campbell. The first preaching in this vicinity by a Disciple was by the Rev. A. E. Myers, a graduate of Beth any college, Virginia, in August, 1852. The pres ent membership] of this church is about sixty-five. The society supports an active Sunday-school, with a membership, at present, of fifty-five."], [427, "CHAPTER XLVIII. FALLSBURY TOWNSHIP. Location\u2014 Streams, Timber and Soil \u2014 Topography \u2014 \" Indians \u2014 First Settlers and Settlements \u2014 F burY \u2014 Postmasters \u2014 Mills \u2014 Churches. \"Rent First Rocks \"\u2014Primitive Condition\u2014 Mound Builders and Township Officers \u2014 Prominent Politicians \u2014 Falls- THIS township is situated in the northeastern part of the county, and is composed, princi- pally, of rough, hilly, almost mountainous land, which is less productive perhaps than any other in *the county, not excepting even the lands of Eden. It is very well adapted to pasturage and grazing, and there are a few narrow valleys where the soil is deep and rich; but it is an exceedingly rough township, comparatively little first-class farming land within its limits, and much of it cannot be cultivated at all, being covered with immovable rocks. The different varieties of oak have always been the prevailing timber. It is watered by the Wakatomika and its tributaries in its northern and eastern part, and Painter's run, a tributary of the Rocky fork, in its western part. The Wakatomika, which empties into the Muskingum at Dresden, is the principal' stream, and affords some water power, which has been used to a limited extent, several mill privileges having been improved upon it within the limits of Fallsbury. The region of the Wakatomika rivals that of the Rocky fork in the picturesqueness and beauty of its scenery, wildness and rugged, mountainous aspect of its general surface. The traveler along the narrow, winding road that skirts the stream will be silled with wonder and admiration at the great upheaval that has apparently taken place in this region. All along the stream the hills are elevated almost to the altitude of mountains, and immense rocks lie piled in every conceivable direction upon their surfaces, and protrude in every conceivable manner from their sides. At a point not far from Grigg's mill is a place of especial interest called \"Rent Rocks.\" It would seem as if an immense rock had been thrown down with such force as to break it in several pieces. These pieces are lying at various distances from each other; some of them far enough apart to admit the passage of a pedestrian or even an equestrian. They are of im mense size, and from their appearance and position have evidently, at some period of time formed one solid rock. There are many other places of especial interest along this stream. In its primitive condition this was an excellent locality for the hunter and trapper, and game con tinued to be plenty here after it had disappeared from the valleys, where the settlements first occur red. Fallsbury retained its primitive appearance longer than most other parts of the county, and, in fact, in many parts yet has the appearance of a new country; being in places heavily timbered, and having many log cabins yet within its limits used as dwellings. Few, if any, traces of the Mound Builders re main in this township; and it is probable that few of their works were erected here. No special Indian history has been preserved, though the first settlers found them occupying this territory. Mr. John Evans, whose father brought him to the Wakatomika, a few miles below the Fallsburgh line in 1808, remembers that for sev eral years his playmates were Shawanee Indian boys. There was an encampment of these Indi ans on Shawanee run, which empties into the Licking, and no doubt they used all the country around, including this township, for their hunting ground. David Bright was the first settler, building his cabin, in 18 18, in the woods upon land since owned by Mrs. Botts. It was among the last set tled sections of the county, from the fact of its # 4-7"], [428, "418 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. being away from the regular routes of travel and the undesirable quality of the land. The settlers that immediately succeeded Bright were Hezekiah Blount, William Wilson, Paul, William and James VanWinkle. Settlers continued to come in rapid ly after the first settlement. The census of 1850 shows a population of over twelve hundred; since that, however, it has steadily declined for some reason. Probably but little more than half of this population remains. Most of these settlers were from Virginia. The township was organized in 1826, and the first election was held at the house of Samuel Varner. William Wilson was elected justice of the peace, and continued to hold the office fifteen years. Joseph Frost was the second, and William V. Hall the third. Minor McQueen, Levi Baugh man, Lofland Hall, Dawson McQueen, James Colville, lohn Frampton, William Hall and others were later magistrates of this township. The first trustees were Samuel Varner, William Wilson and Joseph Frost; first constable, William Hall; first clerk, Samuel Varner. John Evans was the second constable. The township has no very extensively traveled thoroughfare, no turnpike, canal, telegraph or rail road, and nothing to attract emigrants, but in edu cational, moral and religious matters, it is fully up to the average. Noah Reed, Silas Bland, Moses Priest and Mi nor McQueen are now remembered as among the most prominent and active politicians of the ear lier days of Fallsburgh. Mr. Reed was elected to the legislature in 1849. Silas Bland was a son of the Mr. Bland who removed from Pendleton county, Virginia, to the mouth of Licking in 1798, and who, with Hughes and Ratliff, pursused and shot the Indians who had stolen their horses. Silas was born in the sugar camp, and rocked in a sugar trough. He subsequently removed to Perry township. Fallsbury is a small post-town, situated near the center of the township. It was laid out on lands belonging to Silas Bland. This land was first settled by Thomas Meeks and one or two of the McQueens. Minor McQueen was from Virginia, and purchased about two hundred acres 0f land in the vicinity of the present village. Fallsbury was never laid out ; it grew, or seemed to grow naturally, like a mushroom. No especial reason can be given why the town should exist at all, or should have made a start in its present location, except, perhaps, that a few unimportant roads seemed to converge rather irregularly in that vicinity, and it was about the center of a settle ment. John Arnold built the first house; he was a farmer. The second house was built by Jesse Riley. These were both log dwellings, and the latter is yet standing. They were built about 1835 or 1840. Thomas Meeks erected the first black smith shop, soon after these cabins were built. George came a little later and started a saloon and grocery, the first mercantile business in the town. He erected a small frame building for a store room, afterward used as a shoe shop. The place never supported more than one store at a time until within the last ten years, when there have been two the greater portion of the time. Messrs. Robinson, Shake, and Christopher John son are now the store keepers. C. Hull now keeps a wagon shop, and there are two blacksmith shops and a few other small establishments of various kinds. Messrs. Thomas Holmes & Sons conduct a general workshop, where articles of various kinds requiring mechanical skill are manufactured. They are also the owners of a steam engine, which fur nishes the power for a planing-mill, saw-mill and grist-mill, the latter grinding only corn, however. Their business was started about 1869. There are three doctors; about 'twenty dwellings, and perhaps one hundred people in the place. The village has rather a dilapidated, tumble-down look, as if it was not overwhelmed with thrift, and the fact that it is built on very rough ground does not add to its ap pearance. Doctor Gilbert was probably the first postmaster here, and was followed by a Mr. Balcom, who in turn was succeeded by Mr. T. Fisk. J. W. Tilton was the next and Mr. Hickumbottom held the office prior to the appointment of the present post master, L. H. Robison. Probably the first of the many mills erected on the Wakatomika in this township was by Hezekiah Blount, in what is now known as \"Egypt\". This mill has changed owners frequently and been re built, but is yet in operation and owned by Mr. I"], [429, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 4i9 George Higgins was the leader and principal or ganizer. This society was organized at the school house, and the principal members, George Higgins, Gideon McQueen and wife, William Booth and wife, Obediah Baufman, Thomas Gorley, Alice Gilbreath, John Reed, Henry Wilson, Lewis Baughman, Catharine Mossholder, Susan Scott, Ann Scott, Levi Priest and wife, Alexander Smith and Leonard Billman. This organization purchased a dwelling house, and fitted it up for a church building, and George Higgins and Rev. Atherton were the principal ministers. Soon after the war ended, the church ended, and has not, for some years, been known among the churches of Fallsbury. The third church organized in Fallsbury, was the Disciple. This congregation was organized the third Sunday in March, 1869, and during the same and the following year, erected a church building in the village. David D. Mitchel, Mr. White and J. A. Walters were their first preachers; John Howell, elder; Samuel Hupp, clerk, and William Scott, John Howell and Jacob Booth, trustees. The organization consisted of twenty five members or more; it now has a membership of forty-four. The Sabbath-school was organized in 1875, tne average attendance being now about twenty. Outside the village of Fallsbury, there are two churches within the limits of the township \u2014 both Methodist Episcopal. One, the Pleasant Valley church, is located on the Zanesville and Mount Vernon road, about one mile southeast of Fallsbury. This church was organized at the house of Noah Reed, about 1836. Messrs. Noah Reed and George Gardner were the principal movers in the organization; and the original members were Noah Reed and wife, George Gardner and wife, Silas Bland and wife, John Tilton and wife, Aaron Decker, and William Beckham and wife. Their first church building, a log, was erected about one mile south of the present building, in 1837; the second and present building, a frame, was erected about 1857, and cost about one thou sand dollars. Their first regular minister was Rev. Bell, of the Northern Ohio conference. At present this is a large active congregation, Garrison Frampton, and is known far and near as \"Frampton's Mill.\" A saw-mill has been connected with it since it was first erected, which was fifty-five or sixty years ago. The second mill on this stream, known as \"Gregg's mill,\" and owned by William Gregg, was built about 1840, by Henry Crabbs and William Garner. Only a saw-mill was erected here at first, but a few years later the grist-mill was added. These two with the Holmes' mill at Fallsbury, are probably the only mills in the township now in operation. A very early school-house, and probably the first in the township, was erected in the Van Winkle settlement, not far from the village of Fallsbury. One of the first religious organizations in this township was, probably, the Old School Baptist. Miner McQueen was a member of this denomina tion, and soon gathered around him a few settlers who were of his way of thinking, and they held religious meetings in his house, himself preform ing the duties of pastor. Mr. Christopher Coff man also preached occasionally for these people. The organization of the society was effected about 1832, and Miner McQueen, Christopher Coffman, John Fry and wife, Mrs. Buck, Mrs. Varner, Mrs. John Porter and a few others were the original members of this organization. In the old graveyard near Fallsbury yet stands an old, squatty, hewed-log building, the first, and, indeed, the only church erected by this society. It was, probably, built about 1835. Services are yet reg ularly held in this building. The society is a weak one, probably, not numbering over a dozen mem bers at present. During the war a great many new church or ganizations sprang up all over the country, in con sequence of a difference of political opinion, and the strife and feeling engendered by the great Re bellion. These organizations called themselves \"Christian Union,\" aud the members were gener ally members of that portion of the Democratic party, who did not believe in the prosecution of the war for the Union. They were generally members of other churches, who left those churches, because the prayers for the President of the United States and the success of the Union army grated harshly upon their ears. Such a church sprang up in Fallsbury. A Mr."], [430, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 420 which has a membership of about one hundred. The Sunday-school was organized the year after the church edifice was erected (1838), and has been well sustained, six months in the year, to the present time, and now numbers forty or fifty members. The other church in this township, also a Meth odist Episcopal, was organized about the same time as the Pleasant Valley. It is known as the \"Gos hen\" church, and is located in what is known as Egypt, in the valley of the Wapitomika. John Painter was one of the prominent members of this organization, and the society was probably first organized at his house. Garrison Frampton was also a prominent mover in this organization and a class leader. John Rogers, John Frost and Edward Bishop were also among the original members. Silas Bland who lived at that time in the neighborhood of Gregg's mill, was also much interested in this church, and gave the ground upon which their first church building was erected. This first building was a frame, and was built about 1855. Some years afterwards, this same building was moved several miles to its present location in the eastern edge of the township, where it was re paired and built over into the present church, in 1880, costing as it stands about nine hundred dollars. The present membership is probably fifty or more. The organization of the Sunday-school was coeval with that of the church, and is yet main tained. CHAPTER XLIX. FRANKLIN TOWNSHIP. Mound Builders' Works \u2014 Survey \u2014 Topography \u2014 Settlers and Settlements \u2014 Characteristics of the People- Public Officials\u2014 Mineral Deposits\u2014 Schools \u2014 Churches and Religious Matters\u2014 A Pioneer Camp Meeting. \"Is this the land our fathers loved, The freedom which they toiled to win? Is this the soil whereon they moved? Are these the graves they slumber in? Are we the sons by whom are borne The mantles which the dead have worn?\" \u2014 Whittier. THIS township abounded in works erected by the Mound Builders. Few sections of the extensive territory in which these works are located are more prolific than this township. It seems to have been a Mound Builders' paradise. If these silent monuments of a lost race could but talk, what treasures would they reveal. How insignifi cant man appears standing mute and dumb beside these works; what a lesson they teach of man's ignorance, and how all his boasted knowledge and power vanish, as in their presence he is dumb and helpless as a child. They are here, his prac tical sense tells him that, but little else does he know of them. Among the most elaborate and extensive of these works were those on the high hill, the most elevated ground in the vicinity, a short distance north of Amsterdam, near to, and in a northeast erly direction from Fairmount church in Lickin\" township. These consisted of a circular wall or embankment, now only a few feet high, enclosing an area of about eight acres. On the outside of this wall is a ditch eight or ten feet feet in width, which was made by throwing the earth out to make the embankment. These works have been plowed over many times, and are gradually disappearing. Within this enclosure there stood, near its center and within one hundred feet of each other, three mounds, two being of stone. One of the stone mounds had a diameter at the base of forty-five feet, and the other two mounds of thirty feet* all were about twenty-five feet in height. The two stone mounds were removed many years ago by"], [431, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 421 Mr. John Cover, who found in the large one some skeletons within three feet of the surface of the ground, which must have belonged to persons of very large size. The stone in these mounds were not of large size, and the earth, after their removal, was very black, and gave indications of the pres ence of fire before and soon after the commence ment ot the mounds; perhaps upon the first layer of stone, or more likely, upon altars which had been erected, and upon which sacrifices had been offered as an act of worship, as was the practice of some ancient nations. By no means the most insignificant of the works of the Mound Builders in Franklin town ship, is the large stone mound half a mile south of the center of the township. Its diameter at the base was originally about forty feet, but it is much more now, as an attempt made many years ago to open it and get down into the middle, re sulted in greatly reducing its height (probably about twenty feet), and adding to its diameter by throwing the stone down upon all sides of it. The earth was not reached in the middle, but the height of the mound was reduced about ten feet. The late Judge Elnathan Schofield, of Lancaster, who was government surveyor during one of the earlier years of the present century, and as such run the section lines here, one of which crossed this mound, made an entry upon his field notes, after designating its locality, pronouncing it \"a singular pile of stone.\" He probably understood little at that early day about the works of the Mound-Builders, particu- larly their stone works. Probably the \"Tippett\" mound has attracted as much attention as any other in Franklin town- ship. It is situated a few hundred yards east of the road leading from Newark to Linnville, in full view of it, near the former residence of Mr. James Tippett. This mound was seventy-five feet in diameter, and twenty-one feet high. It was opened several years since, and a stone whistle and quite a number of human skeletons exhumed. Two remarkably well preserved crania were taken out, in connection with skeletons, at twenty feet from the top, and just above the level of the land around the base of the mound. The mound was composed of layers of earth, charcoal, ashes and human skeletons. This mound was opened with great care by the Messrs. Tippett, and was one of the most symmetrical and interesting of its class. There is a fort of low banks near the center of the township, in part on the farm of P. F. Coulter, nearly a mile east of the Tippett mound, and about the same distance northeasterly from the celebrated stone mound. There is also a stone mound near the Madison township line, half a mile or more from Clay Lick ; and also one on the farm of A. Inlow, neither of which is of large size. There are also earth mounds of greater or less magnitude on the farms of H. Trout, D. Moore, J. Smith, J. Brownfield, Mr. Handly's \"spring farm,\" and also one near Hopewell township line east of lands of Mr. A. Ballou, besides a few others not mentioned. There is very little, if any, reliable Indian history in any way identified with the territory embraced within Franklin township. This township was composed entirely of United States military lands, sometimes called \"Army lands,\" and was part of the extensive tract dedi cated by the Government to the payment of the officers and soldiers of the Revolution. Congress, by an act passed June i, 1796, authorized the sur vey into ranges and townships, of this tract, and Franklin township appears on the plat of the orig inal survey as in the first tier of townships in the eleventh range. The surveys into ranges and townships took place soon after authority was granted by Con gress, and it was to these surveying parties that Elias Hughes, John Stadden, and perhaps others of the earliest pioneers of this county, were at- tached. The surveys into smaller tracts than townships were made at subsequent, but not re- mote periods. The township is watered by Hog run and Swamp run, the latter heading here, and emptying into Hog run in Licking township; also by Little Clay lick, which heads in Hopewell township and flows through the corner of Franklin; and by Big Clay lick, which has its source near the line of Hopewell, running about five miles through Frank- lin. The bottom lands along these streams are very fertile, and the lands generally, though some- what hilly, are productive, there being little if any *7"], [432, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 422 waste land in the township. Corn, the cereals, and grasses, all grow well. The townships around Franklin were all settled before it, except Hopewell \u2014 Madison in 1798, Licking in 1S01, Bowling Green in 1802, and Newark, which corners with it, in 1800. The first settlers within the territory which now consti tutes Franklin township were George Ernst, John and Jacob Switzer, who came in the spring of 1805, the first-named from the Shenandoah valley, and the two latter from the \"Glades,\" in Pennsyl vania. Mr. John Feasel came in the autumn of the same year, also from the Shenandoah valley. John Siglar came to Licking township in 1805, from Maryland, and on the first day of March, 1807, moved into this township. His son, William, then a mere lad, accompanied him. In 1808 Mr. John Hull joined these pioneers, who were further reinforced in 1809 by Mr. Hugh Scott, Rev. J. W. Patterson, Isaiah Hoskinson, and a Mr. Dustheimer. A Mr. Fulton came, meanwhile, who taught the first school in the township, in a building within the circle of this first settlement. Mrs. Motherspaw, daughter of the pioneer, John Feasel, had the longest residence in this township, having been brought here in 1805; and Mr. Will iam Siglar, the next longest, or since 1807. Mr. John Wilkin, Michael Fry, as well as Uriah Hull and a few others, settled in this township in and before the year 18 12, when the township was organized and named, in honor of the great American philosopher, Benjamin Franklin. Isaiah Hoskinson, sr., and Moses Sutton, sr., were elected the first justices of the peace. Franklin township has not now, and never had, a village in it, except the minature town of Amster dam. It has no stores, no post offices, no grog shops, no manufactories. The people are almost wholly given to agriculture, and to the quiet, hon est, successful pursuit of their avocation, and have attained to a good degree of equality in pecuniary circumstances. The people are sober, industrious, frugal, hospitable, and give no countenance or en couragement to vagabonds, demagogues, busy-bod ies in other people's matters, to the idle, or lazy, to loafers, vagrants, horse-jockies or speculators, pro fessional office-seekers, note-shavers, whiskey-drink- ers, nor, indeed, any who are engaged in vicious and demoralizing pursuits. It is literally and pre eminently a rural township, in which the rural vir tues prevail. During the seventy-five years that have elapsed since the first settlement of the town ship, they have had only four county officers. The late Henry Burner was county commissioner, Mr. Anthony Pitzer county surveyor, Stephen Hos kinson commissioner, and Benjamin Brownfield a member of the legislature. The township has probably furnished as few representatives for the Stale prison as for the State legislature. The Na tional road runs along the southern boundary of Franklin, being mainly in Bowling Green, but in several places running a little into Franklin, as at Amsterdam, and for some distance east of it. The Flint ridge slopes off nearly a mile from Hopewell into Franklin, striking it near the middle of its eastern boundary, making that portion of the township, to the extent of a mile in width, un usually hilly, or somewhat mountainous in its aspects and scenery. Little has ever been done in the way of attempts to turn to practical account the mineral deposits of this township. One such effort was made about fifty years ago by Mr. Hugh Scott, one of the early and enterprising pioneers of the township, who discovered, upon his land, a deposit of iron ore, which he mined, and mar keted by hauling it to the Granville furnace. It was understood generally, to have been attend ed with rather ill success, but whether the enterprise terminated because of the distance between the ore and the furnace, and consequent expense of getting it to market, or whether the deposit was worked out and the supply ceased, or for other reasons is not remembered. If, therefore, the township has any mineral wealth, it is, as yet, un developed. Schools were early organized, and educational matters in the township have kept pace with those of other townships in the county. It is divided into six school districts in which good houses are erected. There is also one fractional district in the southern part. The first religious society started in the town ship was the Methodist society, which now wor ships in Ellis chapel. It was organized at the house of John Siglar, in 1809, or a year later,"], [433, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 423 possibly. The first church edifice they erected was a hewed log building in 1818, on the site of the present building, which superseded it in 185 1. Among the early time ministers of the society were Ralph Lotspeitch, James Quinn, Jesse Stone man, Levi Shinn, brother to Asa, Isaac Quinn, David Young, Michael Ellis, Charles Waddle, Mr. McElroy, Noah Fidlar, Martin Fate, John McMahon, C. Springer, Alexander McCracken, Le roy Swormsted, and Jacob Young. The Lutherans organized the second church in Franklin township. This is the pioneer Lutheran church in Licking county, and the Rev. Andrew Henkle, Rev. Peter Schmucker, Rev. Charles Henkle, and Rev. Amos Bartholomew, were the pioneer Lutheran preachers. The first named organized the Lutheran church in this township, in the autumn of 1817, having previously visited and preached to the people in that neighborhood a few times. The settlers were, for the most part, from the Shenandoah valley, Virginia, and had been trained in the Lutheran faith aud doctrines. George Ernst, Daniel Motherspaw, John Feasel, Henry Burner, Jacob Wilkins, Jacob Row, the family of John Wilkin deceased, and a few others, with the families of the foregoing, patron ized the enterprise of Mr. Henkle, and soon after the organization of the society they erected a hewed-log structure of small dimensions, which answered the double purpose of church and school-house. Rev. Andrew Henkle's father, Rev. Paul Henkle, a well known Lutheran minister in the Shenandoah valley, and the successor of the distinguished Rev. General Peter Muhlenberg, of revolutionary fame and memory, had been the re- ligious instructor of some of these families, and of their fathers and mothers. They, therefore, read- ily and joyfully embraced the opportunity pre- sented of having the Gospel preached to them statedly, by a minister of their own faith, and that, too, by the son of the pastor of their parents. Sometime previous Rev. Andrew Henkle had taken charge of the Lutheran church in Somerset, Perry county, and while living there, he, in 181 7, organized this church in Franklin, and immediately thereafter was elected pastor, and remained such until 1824, when he resigned. After his resignation the church remained with- out a settled minister about two years, but its pul pit was supplied with considerable regularity by Rev. Peter Schmucker, of Newark, then engaged in secular pursuits, but who answered the calls for ministerial services on the Sabbath ; and by Rev. Charles Henkle, of Somerset, a brother of An drew, who had, at that time, charge of some churches in Perry county. The Shenandoah valley was very prolific in Lu therans and Lutheran ministers. Rev. Peter Muh lenberg was, until 1776, the principal Lutheran minister in that valley, and was, moreover, the son of the founder of the Lutheran church in the United States. In 1776, soon after Lord Dun more's treachery to the colony of Virginia became manifest, being then in charge of the Lutheran church at Woodstock, he abandoned his pulpit and took the field as a regimental officer of the Virginia line. Rev. Paul Henkle, father of Andrew and Charles, entered the Shenandoah valley before the close of the last century, and preached there many years. He reached a great age, and continued his ministrations in the pulpit to near the close of his life. He had a large family of sons, all of whom, probably, entered the Lutheran ministry in the Shenandoah valley, except one. Those now re membered were David, Paul, Andrew, Charles and Ambrose, making, with the father, six in all. The father of Rev. Peter Schmucker emigrated to this country, and settled in the Shenandoah valley near the commencement of the present century. Three of his sons, George, Nicholas and Peter, there entered the Lutheran ministry. Nicholas ministered to the same congregation, and from the same pulpit, for a generation at least, which Rev. Peter Muhlenberg had left when he entered the army. The two brothers of Nicholas also preached in the different Lutheran churches of the valley. Rev. S. S. Schmucker and his son, Rev. S. M. Schrnucker, who were son and grand son of George; and Rev. George Schmucker, son of Nicholas, also making six in all, had each charge of Lutheian churches in the valley, which, in the aggregate, ran through a period of many years. Ministrations from these Shenandoah valley preachers to these Shenandoah valley Christian emigrants of Franklin township, often brought"], [434, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 424 vivid impressions of old-time religious services to their minds, and could not Well have been other wise than mutually interesting. Their voices and the voices of those bearing their names, had been heard by these people long before, and here they felt that they were not strangers. In the fall of 1826, Rev. Amos Bartholomew was called to the church as its pastor, and remained about eleven years. After remaining vacant about a year, Rev. J. Manning became regular pastor, in which capacity he served the church nearly eight years; meanwhile the church edifice, commenced during the pastorate of Mr. Bartholomew, was completed, and has since been occupied. It is neat and commodious. After remaining vacant two years, Rev. Mr. Richart became pastor, and remained two years. He was succeeded in a short time by Rev. G. W. Shafer, who continued the settled minister several years. After the res ignation of Mr. Shafer, the pulpit was supplied about one year by Rev. D. F. Phillips, and then by Rev. William M. Gilbreath for two years. The latter was succeeded by his brother, Rev. J. L. Gilbreath, in 1854. The church enjoys a moderate degree of pros perity. It sustains a prayer meeting, and has con nected with it a flourishing Sabbath-school. The first elders of this church were Daniel Motherspaw and George Ernst. The third, last formed, and only other religious society in this township, is the Christian Union church, organized during the progress of the late Rebellion. It was composed, principally, of those Methodists who held their membership at Ellis chapel, in Franklin, and at Spencer chapel, in Hopewell townships, who did not approve of the attitude of the Methodist Episcopal church on slavery, the war, and collateral questions, or who disapproved of the introduction of those secular matters into the pulpit. Some of those who actively participated in the establishment of this church, were William Henslee, William Rutledge, John Cochran, Daniel Loughman, Zachariah Rutledge, David Wolf, John Wolf, John Snelling, Samuel Lampton, and Will iam D. Rutledge. They erected a neat, substantial church near the township line between Franklin and Hopewell. A Sabbath school is connected with the church. Revs. Benjamin Green and W. Henslee for some years after the organization of the church occupied its pulpit. In this connection it will be interesting to re ligious people in the township to know what Mr. Isaac Smucker says in his \"Recollections of 1825,\" regarding the first camp meeting he ever at tended, and which was in this township: \"A few days after my arrival here, in 1825, I attended a camp meeting held in Franklin township, not far from the large stone mound, some eight miles from Newark. The meeting was held in a pleasant and somewhat romantic locality, near the western termination of the Flint ridge. The weather was de lightful, the preaching good, and the surrounding and incidents of the meeting had a flavoi of freshness and novelty about them that rendered the occasion one decidedly enjoyable. \"A tall, slender, erect, long-visaged, grave old man, with elongated hair, that had passed into the last stage of silver-grey hue, occupied himself conspicuously as chief singer of the oc casion \u2014 the venerable leader in the musical department of the devotional exercises. His name was Siglar, I understood, and he sung with spirit, energy and much power of voice. The great congregation joined him and they made the welkin ring sonorously while singing those fine old Metho dist camp meeting hymns. The multitude gathered for worship from all the regions round .about in these ancient groves, were greatly moved, yea ! thrilled by the inspiring notes of the melodious minstrelsy. The reverberations of those sacred songs, as sung by a thousand voices in the spirited, natural, unartistic style of our primitive settlers, in those grand old woods, gave zest to the enjoyment of the interesting occa sion, and the scenes and incidents thereof are numbered among the memories to be cherished in the hereafter. \"Rev. Zerah H. Coston was the only preacher present whose name I now remember. I had heard him preach a sermon a short time before, in front of the old jail, for the ben efit of Peter Dimond, then under sentence of death. I think, however, that Judge Fidlar, whom I heard perform a similar sen-ice for Dimond, was also present, though I am not certain. This was my first appearance at a Methodist camp meeting, but not my last. I attended one held near Chatham, nearly fifty years ago, where I heard Rev. L. L. Hamlin preach his celebrated sermon from the text \u2014 \"Ye are my witnesses saith the Lord ! ' I had heard him preach it once before, and it was worth repeating. Few men had a more attractive style of pul pit oratory than he. I also attended one on the Flint ridge, more than forty-five years ago, conducted by our well known pioneer veteran, the Rev. C. Springer, and another a few years later, held near Elizabethtown, under the same management. I have attended others later, and I confess to a partiality by way of variety, for the old style of camp meeting oratory\u2014 the pulpit in the wilderness, as we had it in the days of \"Auld lang syne.\""], [435, "CHAPTER L.

THIS township is second in the county in popu- lation, wealth and influence. It was fortunate in being peopled from the start with first-class set tlers \u2014 people of intelligence, thrift and energy. They were from New England and a province in Old England \u2014 Wales. The former were shrewd, pushing, enterprising, money-making; and both were honest, industrious, religious. Both came in oganized communities, determined to establish permanent, prosperous and happy homes in the far west. The combination of the various elements of which these communities were composed, was a most fortunate one, and probably a more desira ble population could not be found in the State or United States than they furnished to Granville township. With this foundation to build upon, is it any wonder the superstructure is solid, beautiful, attractive, and destined to have a history of con tinually increasing importance, and an influence for good that will extend its boundary continually as the years go by? The township was organized in 1807, out of the west half of Licking township, Fairfield county. The latter township then embraced all of what is now Licking county, except the Refugee lands. This being cut in two in the center, the west half was named Granville, and was, therefore, the sec ond township organized in this territory. The soil of the northern half is not especially attractive, being composed of hills or table lands and is clayey, but produces wheat and all the small grains in abundance. It was all heavily timbered with the different varieties of oak and other hard woods that flourish on the uplands. This part of the township seems to have been very attractive to the Welsh people, by whom it was mainly settled, probably from the fact that it was, at an early day, far more healthy than the miasmatic bottoms of Raccoon and Licking. Since the county has been cleared, cultivated and settled, these bottoms are as healthy as the \"Welsh Hills,\" and far more pro ductive. There is, however, a good deal of rich bottom land in the township along the Raccoon fork and its tributaries. The peculiar blending of hill and valley in this beautiful region attracted the New England pioneers, who also dreaded the ague and malaria of the broader and more swampy bot toms of Licking, and yet desired bottom land for farming purposes. There is a gentle terraced in cline down the Raccoon from Granville to Newark. This stream of clear, beautiful water passes across the township a little south of its center, tumbling over a rocky and gravelly bed, and is the only stream of consequence within the township limits. An Indian trail branched from the main trail near Newark, and passed across the township up the Raccoon valley to the Wyandot village near Johnstown. Unfortunately no Indian history has been preserved in connection with this township \u2014 and this is the case, also, with most other town- 425"], [436, "426 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. shape and form of this reptilian monster are dis tinctly presented, so that all admit, at the first glance, that it was undoubtedly intended to repre sent the alligator or American crocodile. His en tire length is two hundred feet. The greatest breadth of his body is twenty feet, and his length between the fore legs and hind legs is fifty feet. The limbs are each twenty-five feet long. The head, fore shoulders and back have an eleva tion varying from three to six feet, while the remainder of the body averages considerably less. The head, limbs and tail gradually taper off to their termination. The scholarly author of \"Pre- Historic Man\" visited this effigy in 1876, just before the issue of the third edition of his work, and he expresses the belief that it \"symbolizes some object of special awe and veneration, thus reared on one of the chief 'high places' of the nation, with its accompanying altar, upon which these ancient people could witness the celebration of the rites of their worship, its site having been obviously selected as the most prominent feature in a populous district abounding in military, civic and religious structures.\" It is probable this effigy was an object of worship, as the Mound Builders were certainly a superstitious and idolatrous race. It probably belongs to the same class of mounds as the \"Eagle mound\" in the \"old fort.\" The hill upon which the Alligator mound is situated, is a \"spur\" jutting into the level bottom, and not far from the foot of the hill, and to the east of it perhaps one-fourth of a mile, on the level bottom, is the curiously shaped mound called the \"Cres cent.\" It is an \"immense pile of dirt,\" which seems to lie upon top of the ground as if it had been transported from a distance, thrown down there and fashioned into the shape of a half-moon or crescent. It is composed largely of gravel and in its composition differs largely from the dark, loamy earth around it. This mysterious crescent-shaped pile has been plowed over for fifty years or more, and of course is much reduced in height, but is yet probably six or seven feet high. It is large and thick in the center, and tapers in either direction to a point. It is located on lot number eight of the Granville purchase, now owned by D. M. Knapp. Another very extensive earthwork once occupied ships in the county \u2014 though there is no doubt that this territory, especially the valley of the Raccoon, was extensively used by them as a hunting ground. No permanent Indian camps appear to have had an existence here, unless prior to historic times. The works of the Mound Builders in this town ship are very numerous and interesting; indeed, in number and varied character are scarcely excelled by those of Newark township. The Raccoon val ley and contiguous territory constitute, probably, the most interesting territory in the State, or even in the United States for the antiquarian. Mounds of different sizes and heights, earthworks of every kind know-n to the historian exist here in great numbers. Numbers yet to be seen and traced may almost be counted by the hundred, while many, very many, have disappeared entirely, by the ravages of time and the plow, and live only in the memory of the oldest inhabitants. No particular care seems to be taken to preserve these mounds and works. Wherever they are in the way of the tiller of the soil, they are ruthlessly plowed down or dug away. They are disappearing with com parative rapidity, and very soon, with few excep tions, will live only in history. Occasionally they are erected upon high peaks, or places inaccessible to the plow and cultivator, and in such places are, of course, in the best state of preservation. The traveler between Newark and Granville will observe many of these mounds, a few yet pretty well pre served, even on the extensive and rich bottoms of the Raccoon; but the better preserved works, and those probably the most interesting, are located upon the hills that shut in the valley. Captain M. M. Munson, who occupies a beautiful farm in the midst of these mounds, and who has made them something of a study, is confident that around the great Aligator mound, located not far from his house, is a complete system of mounds and earth works that point to it as a common center. How ever this may be, there is certainly a large circle of works in this vicinity, extending several miles in every direction, and seemingly connected with each other and with the \"Old Fort\" near Newark and its contiguous works. The Alligator mound is situated upon the sum mit of a hill nearly two hundred feet high, about six miles west of Newark, near Granville. The"], [437, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 427 the bottom land near the Crescent, and to the south of it. When the first settlers entered this valley, and for several years afterward, this im mense circular wall was plainly visible and was two or three feet in height in places. It enclosed seventy-five or eighty acres of beautiful bottom land, and, like the Crescent, the embankment seemed to have been made without digging the earth from either side of it, no ditch appearing. This work covered portions of lots seven, eight, nine and ten of the Granville purchase, and the larger part of it was between Centerville street and the bluffs on the north of the valley, though it extended, probably, slightly south of Centerville street. The \"savage plowshare\" has long since done its work, and this work of antiquity has probably entirely disappeared. It is said that the embankment was without a break or gateway, and no mound or other work appeared within the cir cular enclosure. North of this, half a mile or more, east of the Crescent about the same distance, and upon a \"spur\" of the bluffs, on the \"Fort Hill\" or Mc- Cune farm is one of the most wonderful of all the ancient works in this section \u2014 wonderful from its size, peculiar shape and internal arrangement. It is situated upon lots five and six of the Granville purchase, extends a little into the Welsh Hills pur chase, and was evidently intended, from its out side ditch and high embankment, as a military work. Even to this day the embankment is in places, measuring from the bottom of the ditch to the top of the embankment, ten feet in height, though generally it is much lower than this; but when first erected it must have been a work of considerable magnitude. It incloses about fifty acres of ground. The embankment, evidently a breast-work, is a perfect piece of engineering skill, following closely the sinuosities of the brow of the hill, and wherever there is a ditch or depression in the hill, the embankment is higher than in other places. Conforming as it does to the form of the surface of the hill it is irregular in shape. Upon the hill, inside of this inclosure, two small circular works appear, inclosing about half an acre each. These have been plowed over many years and are much worn away, though the walls are probably yet three or four feet in height. These smaller works are in the form of circles, without any break in the walls, and are both located upon the^highest part of the hill, and near to its southern extremity, or, at least, a little south of the center of the greater work. They are very near each other and lie on an east and west line. From the manner in which some of the forts of to-day are built, it would seem that these two smaller works were erected as places of last resort, or, in other words, as works in which to rally and fight after being driven from the outer defences. In the most easterly of these two circular forts, are two small mounds, or lookout-stations, also an east and west line very near each other, and now not over two or three feet high. The whole surface of the hill is under cultivation, and this great work of antiquity is slowly disappearing in consequence. Still further to the east of this work, and upon the bluffs, is situated what is known as the \"reser voir,\" evidently once an artificial lake or reservoir for water. It is situated on lots two and three of the Granville purchase, now owned by M. M. Munson, and is probably twenty rods across the top. It is probably half a mile from the fort above mentioned, is located in a natural depres sion in the hills, and has evidently been scooped out with great labor. Near this, and a little east of north, on lot two, is a \"sugar loaf\" or conical mound of considerable size \u2014 probably fifteen feet in height and forty or fifty feet in diameter at the base. This mound is in a good state of preserva tion. Still traveling eastward upon the bluffs, two con ical hills are reached in half a mile or more, upon which are two small mounds, apparently scraped up to increase the height of these points as look out stations. One is located upon the eastern and the other upon the western line of the farm of L. E. Bancroft, and not far from the eastern line of the township. Coming down into the valley several beautiful mounds are found further east in Newark township. On the southern end of lot eight, of the Granville purchase, belonging to Messrs. T. M. and T. Rose, very near and just south of Centerville street is a curious heap of sand, for which it is hard to ac count, unless it be that the Mound Builders placed it there. It is in the center of a fine alluvial"], [438, "428 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. on the bluffs, are several others similar in construc tion to those described, and the same may be said of the country north and northwest of Granville. To locate and describe all these works would oc cupy more space than can be allowed in this work. Suffice it to say they are very numerous, but not perhaps, different from those already described. A conical mound once existed in Main street, in Granville, between the four churches of that place. It was graded down to make way for the street. It was probably fifteen feet in height at the date of the first settlement. Jeremiah R. Munson deliv ered a fourth of July oration from its summit in 1806. Late in November, 1800, on the banks of Ramp creek, was lighted a camp-fire, around which sat four men who have played no small part in the history of this county. These men were John Jones, Phineas Ford, Frederick Ford, and Benoni Benjamin. Jones and the two Fords were married to the three sisters of Benjamin. Jones was of Welsh extraction, but was born in New Jersey and partly reared in Pennsylvania; the Fords were originally Yankees, from Connecticut, and Benja min was born in Northampton county, Pennsylva nia. His father, Jonathan Benjamin, who followed him to this county about two years later, was born in the same decade with Washington, and was thirty-eight years old at the Declaration of Indepen ence. During the Revolution, in order to protect his family from Indians, he moved tojithe vicinity of Baltimore, Maryland. At the close of the war he returned to Pennsylvania, where he remained until the spring of 1793, when he removed to the Virginia side of the Ohio, nearly opposite Mari etta. Here Jones 'and the Fords married his three daughters. In the spring of 1799 these men, with their brother-in-law, Benoni Benjamin, went out to the Scioto, where they planted and raised a crop, and returning in the fall, moved their families there. In November, 1800, at the instance of Jones, they traveled up the Scioto to where Ciicleville now stands, and from there followed an Indian trail through Fairfield county in the direction of Lick ing. Jones had before seen the Licking valley, hav ing been connected with some surveying expedi- bottom, and is irregular in form, appearing to have been brought from a distance and thrown off there for some purpose, although where it could have been brought from is something of a mystery, as the creek bottom in the vicinity does not appear prolific in the kind of sand of which it is com posed. Immediately south of this sand pile and a few rods from it, yet exists the walls of a large circular work, enclosing, probably, twenty-five acres. The whole of this land has been under cultivation since the first settlement of the country, and the embankment is nearly plowed away in places, though still visible, and generally two or three feet above the surface of the ground. This appears to have been a perfect circle, without ditch on either side, and without any opening or gateway. Its location is near where the old Granville feeder joins the Raccoon. It is very close to, and evi dently connected with, the very large circular work before mentioned as covering seventy-five or eighty acres, and which has entirely disappeared. Directly south of this work, on the same lot, in the vicinity of the spot where the old canal feeder joins the Raccoon, and very near where the old Munson forge stood, is, or rather was, an ancient well. It was long since filled up, and now exists only in the memory of the older settlers. The probability is it was filled in the construction of the canal, as it was very near the southern edge of the embank ment. When first discovered it was sixty or sev enty feet in depth, and had evidently been bored through the soft shale that here underlies the sur face. It was three or four feet in diameter; no water appeared in it, and the supposition is, that the operators, whether Mound Builders, Indians, or white men, had bored for salt, as a salt well was subsequently sunk in this vicinity, and operated for a time with partial success. Further up the creek a few rods, on the lot of E. Haskell is a conical mound, in a good state of preservation, probably ten feet in height, and thirty or forty feet in diam eter. Directly south 6f these works in the valley, on the bluffs south of the creek, are many beautiful mounds. One of them on the farm of H. J. Little is about the size of the above described mound, has not been mutilated, and is yet in a good state of preservation. To the west of this"], [439, "HISTORY FO LICKING COUNTY. 429 tions, as well as Indian raids in this direction. Few, if any of the many enchanting basins in the Mississippi valley presented a more encouraging prospect to the pioneer than the Licking valley at that time, and it is not to be wondered at that Jones, a man of keen perceptions, sharpened and developed by extensive travel and adventure, should have led his little party of adventurers hither. A little incident that occurred at the camp fire before mentioned, is worthy of record. Mr. Isaac Stadden who had arrived at the Bowl ing Green a short time previous, was out hunting, when he suddenly came upon this camp of pioneers. Each party was agreeably surprised at the unex pected meeting. Stadden had supposed that those living in the Licking valley were the only set lers in this section; while Jones and his party, entering the county from the Scioto, supposed they were the advanced pioneers, and that there was no setllement nearer than the mouth of the Lick ing on the Muskingum. The hospitality common among the early settlers made Stadden a welcome visitor for the night. Jones and Stadden soon recognized in each other old acquaintances, they having been school-fellows in Pennsylvania. Neither had seen the other for a quarter of a century, and knew nothing of each other's intervening history, of their adventures or whereabouts. Of the interest of such a meeting of such men, under such circumstances, none but pioneers can conceive. There is a discrepancy in the statements regard ing the time of this meeting, and also regarding the date of the arrival of Jones and his party. Captain M. M. Munson, from whose paper a part of the history of this township is taken, says this meeting took place in the spring of 1800, while Mrs. Stadden, wife of Isaac Stadden, says the meeting took place in the fall of 1800, and that the wives of these gentlemen (the Fords and Benjamin), were not with them at the time, but that they were prospecting in this valley with a view to settlement, and did settle here in the spring of 1 80 1, as has been stated. It is impossible at this late day to reconcile these conflicting statements, but a close study of all the circumstances and incidents connected with the first setttement of the county, a comparison of dates and of matters connected with the early settlers would seem to place the weight of evidence in favor of Mrs. Stadden's statement. Mrs. Stad den was a pioneer of 1800, was very careful in her statements regarding pioneer matters, and a woman of remarkable mind and memory. Before coming here, Jones and his party had been offered what was termed donation lots by the agents of General Dayton, a large land-holder in the territory now composing Licking county. These lots were supposed to be located on Ramp creek, a stream which ran out in side-cuts or bayous, forming little swamps and ooze-grounds, with \"cat-tails and leeks.\" These, to Jones, fore boded agues and biliary diseases, and he at once refused to make the stipulated settlement, and de termined to locate on Middle or Raccoon fork. Jones led his party across the middle fork, searching out one of the many springs of living water that skirt the base of the hills that enclose the valley. On lot number two of the Granville purchase, some ten rods from the foot of the hill, and some twenty rods, from the present Centerville street, he made the first settlement within the pres ent limits of Granville township. Some years before this, a hurricane had passed over this valley, taking down the primeval timber, and at the time of settlement the country was tim bered with a second growth, in many places the blue ash predominating This was particularly the case at the base of the hills, made wet and loamy by the sinking of the waters of the numerous springs that burst from the hill sides. Of these trees Jones built his cabin. By the last days of April, or the first of May, the logs had been cut, and the men, assisted by their wives, raised the first white man's cabin in this township. Jones moved into this cabin, and the entire party re mained with him until cabins had been erected on each of the locations selected. The Fords built on Ramp creek, near Union station, and Benjamin further down that stream, within the present limits of Newark township, not far from where the stream passes under the Granville feeder. Here begins the history of Granville township. Sometime in the same year, Patrick Cunning ham, an Irishman (elsewhere mentioned in the"], [440, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 43\u00b0 John Jones was born in New Jersey, but lived sometime in Pennsylvania, and, subsequently, on the banks of the Ohio river, in the western part of Virginia. The Fords and Benjamin also lived there in 1793. Mr. Jones died in October, 185 1, after raising a family at the mouth of Fishing creek. Nash was in possession and occupying the house at the coming of the Granville company in 1805. There seems to be a desire to immortalize the first cabin erected in any particular subdivision of territory, and, as far as possible, every other first thing that entered into the germ of the new settle ments. At a pioneer meeting on New Years day, 1 868, several canes made from the logs of this first cabin were presented to the officers of the Pioneer society, and the following is an extract from the address of Captain Munson, made at the time: \"The trees from which these sticks were made were cut and builded into a house before either of you were born. The wood was rolled up into the first white man's house reared in this township. In this house was born the first white child in the township, and here was witnessed the first death struggle. The first sermon preached in the township resounded from its walls; its manifold incidents would alone make a volume. * * These mountings are made from ancient coins plowed up around the old house, and could they but reveal their history, we should be amazed and charmed at its witchery and interest.\" The canes were presented to Hon. Isaac Smucker, secretary, and Dr. J. N. Wilson, vice president of the society. In 1803, John Duke, James Evans, James James, and Mr. Chadwick settled in this town ship; Messrs. Evans and James being Welshmen, settled on the Welsh hills. John Duke located near the Raccoon creek, and was elected the first justice of the peace in 1807. Esquire Duke came in 1803, from the vicinity of Wellsburgh, Brooke county, Virginia. His son, S. A. Duke, is now an influential citizen of Arkansas. The settlers, in 1804, of this township were Thomas Cramer, Simon James, and Peter Cramer, who settled on the Welsh hills. They were from western Virginia. The third, and a great epoch in the history of this township is marked by the coming of the Granville colony, in the fall of 1805. About the beginning of the present century, many organiza tions were effected in the east for the purpose of purchasing land and making settlements in the great Northwest Territory and the State of Ohio. history of Newark township), built the second cab in, and became the second settler of the township. This house was about twenty or twenty-five rods northeast of the Jones' cabin, and near another spring. Cunningham planted some trees, and be gan the cultivation of several kinds of plants and fruits. In a year or two he removed to, and be came one of the first settlers of, Newark. In the spring of r8o2, some young men built some shanties, or cabins, a few rods east of \"Pad dy\" Cunningham's, and that season raised a crop of corn. It was in this year that the vanguard of Welsh Hills settlers made its appearance. Deacon The ophilus Rees had made a purchase of land in this township during the previous year, and had sent Chaplain Jones and others out to view it. A care fully written history of this settlement appears in another chapter. David Thomas and David Lewis were the first of the Welsh Hills settlers to enter the township as permanent settlers; but they were soon followed by Theophilus Rees and \"Jimmy\" Johnson. Mr. Munson says that these Welsh settlers, the first of them, came in the fall, bought the crops the young men above mentioned had raised, mov ed into the cabins they vacated, and remained during the winter, beginning their settlement on the Welsh Hills in the spring of 1803. The coming of Deacon Rees and his colony marks a most important era in the history of the township. He was a man of more than ordinary cultivation, a devoted member of the church, and his decendants are among the most respected of this community at the present time. On the first of October, r8o2, Mrs. Jones gave birth to the first white child born in the township, and on the twenty-second day of the same month, Mrs. Jones died of puerperal fever, aged twenty eight years. This was the first death of a white person in this township. She was buried in New ark, on a little hill or hillock (probably an ancient mound,) just west of the market-house, and where the Beckwith family resided. Jones, after the death of his wife, sold his house and improve ments to one Nash, and removed to the mouth of Fishing creek, below Wheeling, where he married a second time."], [441, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 43 1 Among these organizations was the \"Licking Land company.\" The origin of this company, like many other great enterprises in the world's history, it is said, had a love matter at the bottom of it. It is related that a young man offering himself to a young woman, in a neighboring and somewhat rival township, was rejected, and on his way home made a resolve to emigrate from a land where women were so fickle and false, to the new coun try beyond the Ohio. However this may be, on the twenty-third day of April, 1804, in East Gran ville, Massachusetts, a meeting was held, at which articles of association were drawn up and signed by thirty-five persons, mostly residents of the towns of Granville, Massachusetts, and Granby, Connect icut. In the preamble, the objects of the associa tion were stated to be the purchase of lands in the State of Ohio; the sending of agents to Ohio to explore, to obtain correct information as to quality and situation of lands, price, mode of payment, title, etc. The body of the article makes them a body corporate, with as large powers as could be attained without special legislation, with two arti cles of reservation : The first forbids a levying of taxes by a vote of the company, unless one-half of the subscribers or corporators should be present \u25a0 the second provides that the agreement shall not be binding unless thirty persons shall subscribe to the same. Of the thirty-five persons subscribing to these articles, none survive. Captain Levi Rose, who lived and died at his old home on North street, was the last survivor. By a subse quent vote of the corporation, the price of mem bership, which had been eight dollars, was raised to ten dollars. May 10, 1804, the company met and appointed Levi Butler, Timothy Rose and Job Case agents, to go to Ohio to view and pur chase such lands as would justify a settlement of the company. On the first day of August, 1804, another meet ing of the company was held, when forty-four more persons signed the articles of association. Of these none survive. Amos Carpenter dying in Columbus, was, probably, the last. The agents appointed to view the land came to Ohio in May, 1804, and returned the following September. Their notes of observation taken dur ing these explorations, and reported to the associ- ation, show them to have been men of clear heads and sound judgment. September 24, 1804, a meeting was held, at which a new paper was presented in the nature and character of an article of agreement, in which the subscribers bind themselves, their heirs, executors and administrators to the performance of the sev eral stipulations set forth in the paper. This is the most concise and explicit, in fact, the most lawyer like instrument of writing that appears among the various papers of the company. Indeed it should have been such, as everything pertaining to the success of the company depended upon its accu racy and binding effect. By this article of agree ment the subscribers bind themselves to become the purchasers of the number of acres of lands set opposite their names. The greatest number of acres taken by one person was one thousand five hundred and the next greatest one thousand. These subscriptions were made by Jesse Munson and James Smith. The average of subscriptions was about two hundred acres each. Levi Butler, Timothy Rose, Job Case, Russel Atwater, Seth Hayes, Noahdiah Holcomb, Solomon Noble, Timothy Spellman, Levi Hayes, Samuel Thrall, Zadoc Cooley, and Cornelius Slocum, by this instrument, were made a committee, or rather a board of trustees, to receive deeds in trust, and to perform certain specific duties recited in the article. This was an important commission and the trust committed to them was executed with fidelity. Deacon Levi Hayes, who lived on Centerville street, and died in October, 1847, was the last sur vivor. Many of the men composing this company were men of mark, who for solidity of judgment and probity of character, would adorn any age. Their history reaches back to the days of the Revolution, when they stood shoulder to shoulder in defence of their country. In the closing scene of that conflict at Yorktown, three of them stood in the ranks of their countrymen, and witnessed that proudest of events, for Americans, the surrender of the British army. Timothy Rose as lieutenant, commanding the left of his company, assisted in the storming of a British redoubt. Of the one hundred and eight subscribers to"], [442, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 432 these articles of agreement on September 21, 1804, in Granville, Massachusetts, none now sur vive. General Augustine Munson, it is believed, was the last survivor. He was a man of more than ordinary ability and importance in the Gran ville colony. He was among the first . purchasers of land in the township, and lived upon his farm until his death. A period of more than sixty years. He built the first saw-mill in Granville township, and displayed much energy and enter prise as an iron founder, canal contractor, and con structor of public works. He rendered efficient military services in the War of 181 2; was county commissioner a number of years, and a member of the State legislature from 1822 to r824, filling all positions of trust with marked fidelity and ability. His son, Captain M. M. Munson, writes as follows regarding his father and other matters of historical interest: \" General Augustine Munson was born in Granville, Massa chusetts, September 30, 1783. He was the youngest child of Jesse and Mariam Munson. At the age of ten years he car ried on horseback the first through mail from Schenectady to Fort Erie, the site of the present city of Buffalo. This jour ney he made through the then wilderness country with no other guide than a pocket compass. At the age of fourteen he was sent to school at, the academy in Lenox, where he remained some time, when he was placed under the instruction of the late Dr. Cooley, who kept a select school for young men in Granville, Massachusetts. In 1804, a company was formed in Granville, Massachusetts, called the Licking Land company, for the pur pose of buying land and effecting a settlement in Ohio. Mun son was the youngest member who signed the articles of asso ciation and emigrated with the colony in the fall of 1805, to Granville, Ohio. He was at the sale of the company held in December of that year, and became the purchaser of several lots of land as surveyed and sold by the company. In the year 1806 he built the first saw-mill in the township. It had a ca pacity of four thousand feet per day. This mill was of vast importance to the new colony, as it furnished the only lumber for building to be had for miles aronnd, and no mill since con structed has ever done so much to meet the wants of this com munity. The winter following the coming of the colony sup plies of flour, salt, etc., had to be brought from Chillicothe and other distant points, and Mr. Munson was generally em ployed in managing all expeditions in that line. In the years 1806 and 1807 he went to New York and New England to ad just the unfinished business of the colony in that quarter. In the years 1808 and 1809 expeditions to the lake for fish and other supplies were undertaken by him, and in the same years a flouring-mill was projected and completed much to the con venience and independence of the new settlement. During these years he, together with the more gay and festive part of the colony, organized a band of music, and instituted balls and festal assemblies. At the commencement of the war of 1812, this band was mustered in as a regimental band, joining the regiment of Colonel Cass, and was at the surrender of Hull at Detroit. Captain Levi Rose's company of infantry was surren dered at the same time, and all came home on parole together. \"Munson was employed in forwarding supplies to General Harrison's army, and continued active in some branch of the service till the treaty of peace was signed in 1815. Coming home from the war he, in company with his brother, Major Jeremiah R. Munson, constructed and put in successful operation the 'Granville furnace.' This enterprise had more to do in bringing trade and traffic to Granville than any one project be fore or since put on foot. After the fnrnace began to make blooms he started the 'large works' for the purpose of making wrought iron. This work supplied a want heretofore much felt in this part of the State. The iron in its various forms be came a metallic currency \u2014 a medium of exchange of great value to the settlers. \"The war of 1812 engendered a high military spirit all overthe country, and General Munson, and the Granville people were not exempt. Military drills had been in vogue from the first settlement of the township. It now grew in force, and instead of a single company, a regiment was organized, and Munson was elected and commissioned as major at the election in 1815; he was promoted to colonel, and remained in command of the regiment till the fall of 1818, when, in one of the most spirited and exciting contests ever known in this part of Ohio, he was elected brigadier general over Colonel Simons, of Mt. Vernon. So excited were the partizans in the contest, that one side demanded that the rival candidates should decide the contest by a \"passage at arms,\" and it is recorded that General Mun son did not decline the combat. They were both good swords men, but both had too good sense to make such fools of them selves for such an occasion. In 1821-22-23 General Munson was returned to the lower house of the legislature where he took part in the discussion of, and voted for the \"Internal Im provement Measures,\" then being inaugurated in Ohio. \"In 1825 he became a contractor on the Ohio canal, building the Licking summit, Licking dam, deep cut, eight locks, etc. \u2014 all difficult and heavy jobs. These works bore ample testi mony of his thoroughness and good laith as a contractor on the public works. \" In the session of 1830-31, by his personal effort aud influ ence, he secured the vote of the members from Licking county for Mr. Ewing for United States senator, thereby putting the right man in the right place, securing to Ohio one of the ablest members the State has ever had in either branch of con gress. Mr. Ewing, it will be remembered, was elected by one majority. General Munson was a great admirer of Mr. Clay, and when that gentleman came home with his cattle from Eng land, he visited Kentucky, and purchased some of that and previous importations. He afterwards gave considerable at tention to the introduction of improved short-horned cattle into Licking county. \"In 1842 he projected and put in operation a lard oil factory which, though he made superior oils, was not a financial suc cess. The fact of it being too far from the great markets where greases accumulate and can be purchased at an advantage, was the cause of its failure as a remunerative enterprise. From this time on the general spent most of his time on his farm, never, however, losing his interest in all measures and projects that would redound to the advancement and happiness of the whole country. He always kept an open house and a free table : His motto was 'Never breach the laws of hospitality.' Munson,"], [443, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 433 on reaching his majority in the fall of 1804, cast his first vote for Jefferson. He was a firm supporter of Mr. Madison's measures in the war of 1812, and stood by the administration of that pure patriot and statesman all through the difficulties and embarrassments that environed it. He voted for Mr. Mon roe, and also for Mr. Clay, but gave a cordial support to the administration of Mr. Adams who was made President by the action of Congress. At the reorganization of parties or rather the formation of new parties which took place at this time, General Munson took sides w-ith the Whigs, and supported the measures and policy \u2014 \"the American Policy,\" \u2014 as he was wont to call it, of that party, so long as it remained a political or ganization. ' 'General Munson was never hemmed in by the narrow limits of his own State, or circumscribed by any lines drawn inside of the boundaries of the whole country. He had no sympathy with those who would sectionalize one part of the country against the other, and held in execration him whoever or wheresoever he might be who would raise his parracidal hand against the fair. fabric of American constitutional liberty. It was the good for tune of Clay, Webster and other patriots of their day and generation, who had stood by the country, to die when the sunshine of peace was over the land. Not so with General Munson. After he had grown old and feeble, he saw the dark cloud of rebellion rise and burst in all its fury upon the country; but Heaven generously lengthened his days to see the carnage of blood cease, and behold the dawn that betokened a day of peace and reconciliation. Full of hope, and while the ship of State was still rocking on the troubled waters, he was permitted to close his eyes in death. He died April 12, 1868, in the eighty-fifth year of his age.\" The Licking Land company held various meet ings in Granville, Massachusetts, during the fall and winter of 1804-05. At a meeting held on the seventh of February, 1805, it was moved \"to adjourn to meet the first Monday in December next at nine o'clock a. m., on the Hardy section, purchased by the said com pany in the State of Ohio.\" The motion was car ried by a unanimous vote. To carry into effect such a resolution, contem plated a work of no little magnitude. It was the work of moving an entire community by the slow process of team and wagon from the Connecticut valley to the then far western wilderness of Ohio. Those accustomed to steamboat and railroad-car as a means of transit, can form but a feeble conception of the time, labor and fatigue incident to such an undertaking. In the spring of this year a small company was sent forward to survey the land pur chased, build a saw-mill, clear ground and raise crops to feed the coming emigrants. Regarding the arrangements and derangements, packings and unpackings, partings and departings, the tears of anguish, the hardships and privations of a journey of so many hundred miles in the then crude con dition of the roads and means of transit, the reader must draw upon his imagination ; but on November 2, 1805, the advance corps of emi grants, consisting of five families, arrived within the limits of this township. These were followed by daily accessions, so that before the setting in of winter forty-five families, consisting of two hun dred and thirty-four persons, had arrived. November 16th (Sabbath), the first divine wor ship was held. Dr. Little, who for nearly forty years was pastor of the Granville Congregational church, speaking of this meeting, says that although only about one dozen trees had been cut, they held services both forenoon and afternoon. The novelty of worshipping in the woods, the forest extending hundreds of miles in every direc tion, the hardships of the journey, the winter set ting in, the fresh thoughts of home, with all the friends and privileges left behind, and the impres sions made by their present accommodations com pared with those they had relinquished, all bore with considerable weight upon their minds, and made the day one long remembered. When they began to sing, the echo of their voices among the trees was so different from what it was in the beau tiful church they had left forever, that they could not restrain their tears. The voices of part of the choir were for a season suppressed with emotion. An incident in this connection is related of Deacon Theophilus Rees, who two or three years previously had settled on the Welsh Hills. As this incident appears on page 107 of this work, it need not be repeated here. The committee for the company had purchased seven sections of land, comprising about twenty eight thousand acres. Three of these sections \u2014 the second, called the Wells, the third, called the Hardy, and the fourth, called the Stanberry sec tion \u2014 had been re-surveyed by James Coe, the company surveyor, into one hundred acre lots, in the spring and summer before the colony arrived. These sections comprised the southeast, southwest, and northwest quarters of what is now Granville township. Mr. Coe had, agreeably to the instruc tions of the committee, laid out the town as near to the spot where these three sections cornered as the face of the country would admit. This state-"], [444, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 434 ment reveals the why and the wherefore of the lo cation of the town of Granville. According to the terms of the article of associa tion, a sale by public auction, to the highest bid der, of farm lots in the first division, was held on the eleventh day of December. A consideration of this sale may be interesting as an index of the far-seeing judgment and moneyed abilities of the bidders. Their homes in New England had passed into the hands of strangers, and themselves strangers in a strange land, with but the surveyor's plats and maps before them, while the lands repre sented were in a dense wilderness with nothing but the axe-man's blaze to guide them to their future homes. The auctioneer commenced: \"How much is bid for the first choice.\" Every one in his own mind had made his selections; but the quandary was, how many were of the same mind? For once in their lives it was not desirable that all should be of the same way of thinking. After several cries by the auctioneer the bidding commenced, and the first choice of the whole, twelve thousand acres in this division, was struck off to Timothy Spellman for one hundred and thirty-eight dollars. He took lot thirteen, range three. This lot is generally known as the Major Case farm. It includes all the village north of Broadway and east of the Granger house, includ ing the Female college, the Union school-house grounds and Mr. Price's farm down to and includ ing Odell's flouring-mill. Mr. Spellman, with his courage now up, bid in four more, making the five first choices of an aggregate of seven hundred and thirty-six dollars and then went home, and it is said, slept none that night, not from overjoy at his good fortune, but from thinking he had paid too deer. The amounts paid for the next forty choices ranged higher than the first. The highest sum paid was for the forty-fourth choice, taken by Job Case for three hundred and forty-four dollars. He took lot twenty, range three. It lies one mile west of town and is known as the William Sherman farm. A few lots were taken without any premium paid for choice. Lot twenty-five, range three, was awarded to Ebenezer Cheney for nothing, there being no competition and no bidding. He was awarded the lot for the asking. It is the east lot of Mr. Henry Reed's farm; the. little stream called Cheney run, meandering through it. The first division of lots having been disposed of, the proprietors proceeded to sell the four other sections, which were located in St. Albans, Hart ford and Bennington townships. The town plat, as surveyed, containing an aggre gate of one hundred and seventeen acres, was sub divided into blocks and then into lots. Almost every colonist was the owner of a lot, and most of the houses built and improvements made during the first winter were confined to the town plat, so that by the spring of 1806, Granville had assumed the metropolitan appearance of a small Indian village. A house for the double purpose of school and church, was one of the first built. A school was taught during the winter, and worship was regu larly held both forenoon and afternoon of each Sabbath. The colony had organized a church previous to leaving New England. The meeting at which this organization was effected, was held in East Granville, Massachusetts, May 1, 1805. The official record is in rather quaint English, and is as follows : \"We, the subscribers, ministers of the church of Christ, be ing at East Granville, a number of individuals, serious persons, belonging to Granville, Massachusetts, and Granby, in Connec ticut, and being about to remove to Granville, in the State of Ohio, requested to be formed into a regular church state pre vious to their departure. We attended to their request and formed them accordingly, and recommend them to the care and favor of the Great Head of the church. Likewise, at their re quest, we attended while they chose Timothy Rose and Levi Hayes for their deacons, and Samuel Everett, jr., their clerk. [Signed] Aaron Church, Nathaniel Gaylor. Ozius Ells, Timothy M. Cooley, Joel Birker, Roger Harrington.\" The confession of faith, the covenant and articles of discipline adopted by the church, are about the same as were in general acceptation and use in the Calvinistic churches of New England, of that day. The male members present and signing the articles of agreement were Samuel Everett, Israel Wells, Joseph Simmel, Timothy Rose, Ros well Graves, Job Case, Samuel Thrall, Levi Hughes, Huron Rose, Samuel Everett, jr., Silas Winchel, and James Thrall."], [445, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY 435 The first meeting, according to the record held by this church after their arrival in Ohio, was February 7, 1806, at which they took into consid eration the expediency of choosing a special com mittee to. correspond with missionary societies and ministers of the gospel, on the subject of obtain ing the ministrations of the word of God in this place. They chose for this purpose James Coe and Samuel Everett, jr. June 15, 1806, this church had the sacrament of the Lord's Supper administered to the members for the first time since their removal here, by Rev. Samuel P. Robbins, pastor of the Congregational Church of Christ in Marietta. A regular record of the church proceedings were kept by the clerk, Mr. Everett. This record shows that various lec tures were read by the secretaries, dating back as far as February 7, 1806. On Wednesday, February 19th, a lecture was read by Mr. Hoge, a missionary of the general assembly. This was the Rev. Dr. Hoge, who settled about this time as pastor of the Presbyterian church at Franklinton, and removed with that church to Columbus, remaining its pas tor until his death, in 1864. His pastoral labors with that people covered a period of over fifty years. April 24, 1808, Rev. Timothy Harris, a licen tiate from Vermont, preached his first sermon in Granville. On the nineteenth of December of that year, Mr. Harris was ordained pastor. Revs. Lyman Potter, Samuel P. Robbins, James Scott, John Wright, Jacob Lindley and Stephen Lindley were present and officiated. Mr. Harris graduated at Middlebury college, Vermont, ard came to Granville a single man, but soon married Bethiah Linnell, daughter of Joseph Linnell. He was a man of fair ability, good scholarship, great modes ty and undoubted purity. He continued preach ing many years in this church, and died about the year 1822. His place was supplied by Rev. Ahab Jenks, who was dismissed about 1825. It was thought that Mr. Jenks became obnoxious to the church, or a portion of it, because he consented that the masons who were at work on a house he was building, late in the fall, might work on the Sabbath. After the dismissal of Mr. Jenks, they had no regular pastor until about 1827 or 1828, when Rev. Jacob Little was settled. Just previous to the death of Mr. Harris, or from 1818 to 1822, the state of religion and mor als was rather low in Granville. Mr. Harris had be come an invalid, meetings were not regularly held, and but little religious interest was manifested. Illustrative of this, some of the young people devised a theatrical performance, and obtained permission of the church authorities to occupy the church for that purpose. A stage was improvised on the top of the unfinished pews. Tragedies were performed, and perhaps some farces; comic songs were sung, and the performances were con tinued two nights. No charge was made. The house was well filled; people coming from Newark and the surrounding neighborhoods. The names of a few of the performers were Matthew Adams, jr., Hiram Pettibone, Stephen Smith, Calvin K. Warner, William Wing and Jeremiah Jewett. The trustees, however, soon came to the conclusion that the church was not the proper place for such performances. During Mr. Little's pastorate the following inci dent is said to have occurred: It was decided that a bell should be purchased for the church. An estimate was made as to the cost, and a subscrip tion raised to cover, as was supposed, the expense of procuring the bell and hanging it in the tower. A day was appointed for raising it to its place, and the people assembled in large numbers to witness the operation. Too late, it was ascertained that the cost of the bell and other expenses were much more than was expected, and no more money could be procured to pay this debt. Everything was ready, the people were assembled, and yet the rais ing was delayed, when it leaked out in some way that more money must be raised, to pay the deficiency, else the bell could not be put in its place. The assembled crowd did not pro pose to be cheated out of the object for which they came together; money enough was immediately raised to cover the debt and the bell put in its place. It is thought that this was the first church bell in the county. A frame church edifice was erected about 1815, but not entirely finished until 1827, when Mr. Lit tle took charge. This w-as the building in which occurred the theatrical performances. Prior to the erection of this frame church in 181 5, two others"], [446, "436 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. had been in use by this congregation. One, a log, was erected in the winter of 1805-6, and was used until about 1810. It was used as a school-house and church together, and for other public meetings. About 1810 this congregation erected a small frame which was in use until 18 15, when the larger frame above mentioned was erected. This latter build ing was removed about 1864, and the present fine brick edifice erected. Dr. Little's pastorate extended over thirty-nine years. He was very popular, a man of ability and influence, and much beloved by his people. The society over which he presided was not only a religious society, but it had the courage as early as 1831 to take a strong stand against intemperance. Whiskey drinking, as is well known, was freely in dulged in by men of all parties and conditions, as well as by church members, even the Puritan blood of this church not excepted. Dr. Little was a prime mover in this first temperance society, and its influence soon became so potent for good that strong drink was no longer tolerated in the church. Dr. Little was followed by Revs. David Beech and Mr. Dudley, and the present pastor, Rev. D. B. Hervey. This church is yet large in numbers, and in a flourishing condition, having changed to Presbyterian about the time the old and new school Presbyterian churches united. The Sunday-school of this church was first or ganizid soon after the advent of the colony in the county, 'and has been successfully continued until the present time, and is now large and active. It may be proper here to state that the first Pres byterian preaching in the township was probably by Rev. Thomas Marquis, in 1803. This gentleman visited the Raccoon valley at that date and preached a sermon in an unoccupied cabin, probably that erected by John Jones and vacated by him after the decease of his wife. Patrick Cunningham at tended this service, and, like all the settlers at that time, was poor and had hoped some of them would tender the requisite hospitalities to the minister; but they all left without inviting him to remain over night, for the reason, pephaps, that each thought his means inadequate to entertain him properly. After all had left, Patrick, whose theological views were in sympathy with those of the preacher, told him that he would gladly entertain him, but that he had nothing fit to set before him. On this subject a colloquy took place between them which developed the fact that corn for the horse, and milk, corn bread and potatoes for the preacher were on hand, whereupon a tarry until the next day was soon ar ranged. Mr. Marquis afterward, in 1807, held communion service in Newark for the few scatter ing Presbyterians, and this is about the extent of his operations in this county, so far as remembered. He was from Washington county, Pennsylvania. The first Episcopal preaching in Granville, it is believed, was by Bishop Chase, of Kenyon college. On his way from the east, he passed through this place, was requested to hold services and did so. His own short record of it is thus given in 181 9 : \"On my way home, I preached and performed service at Granville. The audience, though assem bled at two hours notice, was attentive, and further services were requested.\" From time to time Episcopal services were held by different ministers passing through, but it did not become a regular preaching station until 1826, when Rev. N. G. Baldwin, taking Granville in con nection with Zanesville and Newark, organized a parish here. From that time to the present, though occasion ally with long intervals of neglect, the parish of St. Luke's, Granville, has had services. The fol lowing ministers have officiated: Revs. P. Chase, J. Morse, N. G. Baldwin, George Denison, S. A. Bronson, W. C. French, E. A. Strong, Thomas Corlett, E. B. Kellogg, C. S. Doolittle, and J. W. McCarty. In proportion to its numerical strength and pecu niary ability, St. Luke's church ever set the other par ishes of the diocese a good example. Zealous, active and liberal, though but a small band, the members in 1837, erected on the public square a house of worship, which externally was- an ornament to the town, and internally tasteful a>id neat. With furni ture and organ, its total cost was a little over seven thousand dollars, in those days by no means a small sum. St. Luke's was, for many years, self-supporting; able to keep a pastor of its own, and give him a respectable living; only, however, by great effort"], [447, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 437 and self denial on the part of its members, who, in the best days of the parish, never numbered mere than sixty-seven. That which mainly gave the church strength and stability was the presence of the ladies' seminary, connected with it. In 1838 Rev. Alvah Sandford commenced an Episcopal school for young ladies, which, for many years, was very successful. The buildings in which this school was kept, had been erected by a Baptist society under the lead of Charles Sawyer, in r832. Mr Sawyer becoming embarrassed, was compelled to dispose of the build ings, and they were purchased by the Episcopal church. Those connected with this institution, combined with resident Episcopalians, made a weak church comparatively strong. This institution, passing into the hands of another principal, Rev. C. S. Doolittle, it was de cided some years ago to remove it to Mansfield. This was a misfortune to the people of St. Luke's, as it deprived them at once of the regular services of a resident pastor \u2014 a deprivation which had the most depressing effect. Since that time the par ish here has simply kept together, holding its own, perhaps; having a few additions from time to time, but losing by removals about as much as it gains. The main consolation of the good people of St. Luke's is, that what has been their loss, has been gain to some other parish, that many of those who are an honor to the church, in other portions of the diocese, entered on their Christian course at Granville. Rev. J. W. McCarty ministered to the church about ten years. Regular preaching has not been sustained since 1873, but occasional services are yet held. Rev. Hall now ministers to the people of this church occasionally. The Rev. Edward Jones, now of Cincinnati, is believed to have preached the first Welsh sermon in Granville, at the residence of Mr. Jenkin Hughes, about the year 1834. About this time also, a Sabbath-school was organized. These ser vices and Sunday-school exercises were conducted in a rented room over the post office. Revs. Edward Jones, William Parry and William 18 Morgan were occasional preachers until 1840, when Rev. William Parry became the settled min ister. He remained until 1852, and was succeeded by Rev. Joseph E. Davis. Rev. E. T. Evans became the settled minister in 1856. At the organization in 1839, William Ellis, John Jones and William T. Williams were elected elders. J. J. Hughes and John R. Owens were subsequent ly elected. A small Sabbath-school is connected with the church. The first church edifice was erected in 1843; this was succeeded, in 1856, by the building now occupied. Services in this church have always been conducted in Welsh. TheWelsh Hills Baptist church was organized Sep tember 4, 1808, in the cabin of David Thomas, by Elder James Sutton, assisted by Mr. Steadman. It was styled the \"First Regular Baptist Church of Granville,\" because of its location in Granville town ship. It continued to be known by that name until 1 81 9, when, upon the organization of the Regular Baptist church, in the village, its name was changed to its present title. The original members of this organization, nine in number, were Theophilus Rees, David Thomas, jr., Nathan Allyn, jr.; David Lobdell, Joshua Lob dell, Thomas Powell, Elizabeth Rees, Elizabeth Jones and Mary Thomas. Theophilus Rees was elected deacon, and Mr. Lobdell clerk. They worshipped in private houses for some time, but a log building, with a puncheon floor, and, in size, about eighteen by twenty feet, was erected during the year 1809, on the Rees purchase, about one mile northeast of Granville, which was used, more or less, for a church and school-house several years, when a building, twenty by twenty-four feet was erected two miles north, of round logs, pun cheon floor and pulpit. Mr. Phillips donated a few acres of land in connection with this church for a cemetery, in which he and many of his family and descendants are buried. In 1822, this church was used as a school-house and accidentally burned down, Deacon Theophilus Rees had also donated some"], [448, "43\u00ab ground for a cemetery where the original church stood, which is yet known as the \"Welsh Hills cemetery,\" and in which he and his family are buried. It was given by him February 6, 1808, and on the same day, Rees, son of David Thomas, was buried there, being the first interment. David Lewis and Simon James dug the grave. These meeting-houses were used alternately, for the better accommodation of the old people of these neighborhoods. A school-house, standing at a point about mid way between these meeting-houses, was used some years for church purposes, and private houses were, meanwhile, frequently used for this purpose, as well as churches. In 1823, a large hewed log meeting-house was built near the site of the one that was burnt, where services were conducted until 1834, when it, too, burnt during its occupancy as a school-house. After this, a stone school-house, on the farm of Rev. Thomas Hughes, was occupied by the church two years. At present the services of this church are held in a comfortable frame church-building standing near the old Cambria mills, erected in 1836. It is about thirty by forty feet in size. Deacon Theophilus Rees may justly be re garded as the founder of the Welsh Hills church. Through his influence and exertions it was organ ized, and four of his family were among the first members of it. He lived only about four and a half years after its organization, when it had at tained to a membership of thirty. He died in February, 1813, aged sixty-six years. He exer cised the functions of deacon until his death, and was a useful, intelligent and Christian pioneer. The Welsh Hills church was among the first organized in Licking county. The small Method ist organization on Hog run, ministered to by Rev. Asa Shinn, in i8o3-'4, and the organization ef fected on the eastern borders of the county through the instrumentality and labors of Rev. Joseph Thrap, in 1805-6, together with the Con gregational church of Granville, organized in Mas sachusetts, in 1805, and a Methodist church in Newark, being the only ones of prior date, with in the present limits of the county. This small church had preaching very irregu- larly for the first two years of its existence. Rev. Thomas Powell preached occasionally, and other pioneer preachers, braving the dangers and priva tions incident to life in the wilderness, sometimes visited and preached for them. Meetings were, however, held regularly, and every month the church met for praise and prayer. June 10, 1810, Rev. J. W. Patterson, who had recently settled in the county, became settled pas tor, and continued that relation until 1816. Elder John Mott, of Knox county, was chosen pastor, and although aged and infirm, continued his ministerial labors six years. During 181 9, Elder George Evans supplied the pulpit temporarily, and for a year there was no settled minister. About 1823, Mr. Owen Owens, of this church, was licensed to preach, and during his missionary operations, organized \"Liberty,\" \"Genoa\" and \"Homer\" churches. In March, 1823, Elder Thomas Hughes, a licentiate from Wales, who settled in the neigh borhood, was chosen pastor, and supplied the church regularly until 1832, when he resigned. During his pastorate services were held in the stone school-house, and in the old log church. Elder James Berry served the church one year after Elder Hughes resigned. In 1833, Mr. Hughes again became settled minister, and served the church until 1841. Seventeen persons united with the church dur ing his ministry, and the aggregate reached seven ty-one members. Mr. Hughes' resignation was again reluctantly accepted, the church esteeming him a man of sound judgment, and of great wis dom in counsel. Elder James Sargent, a young man from Gran ville college, served the church very acceptably one year. During his ministry thirty persons were received into the church. After his resigna tion, Messrs. Roberts and Owens, students from Granville college, supplied the church a year or more. In 1844, Elder David Pritchard, of New York State, was chosen pastor, and remained two years. In 1846 William Smedmer engaged to supply the church three-fourths of the time, which he did until 1848, when he resigned, and was succeeded"], [449, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 439 by E. S. Thomas, who remained about two years. He was succeeded in 1849 by Rev- J- W. Heistand. In i85r Thomas Hughes was called for the third time to the pastorate of this church, and died September following, after having been a member of the church for fifty years, most of that time in the ministry. After his death, the church was served some time by Rev. Dr. Bailey, president of Granville college, and Rev. J. Lawrence. They were fol lowed in 1853 by Rev. N. Clouse, who remained two years. In January, 1855, Rev. Dr. Hall be came minister, and served five years, frequently assisted by Mr. Clouse and Rev. E. D. Thomas. Mr. Clouse became pastor again in January, 1863, and continued three years; being succeeded by Rev. B. J. Powell, who also served three years. President Talbot followed for one year, and Rev. A. Jordon for nine months. Revs. J. Kyle, N. Clouse, Miller and Thornton have successively occupied the pulpit since Mr. Jordon's time. During seventy-two years this church has been four and a half years without a pastor. The long est pastorate, that of Rev. Thomas Hughes, was seventeen and a half years. At present there are fifty members connected with the church; and the Sabbath-school, organized about 1825, contains sixty members. The Muskingum association was formed in this church in May, 181 1, in the building first erected, by Revs. William Brundige, Jacob Drake, William Thrift and J. W. Patterson. This church remained with said association until 1841, when it united with the Columbus association, with which it is yet connected. The services in this church have generally been conducted in the English language, but occasion ally in Welsh. The First Baptist church of Granville was organ ized in 1819. In Howe's history of Ohio, it is stated that the first Baptist sermon preached in Granville was by Elder Jones in 1806. This is undoubtedly the \"Chaplain Jones\" of revolution ary fame, who often visited Licking county, and especially Granville and the Welsh hills, and preached to his Baptist friends, and a sketch of whom will be found in another part of this work. This society may be considered an offspring of the Welsh hills church, founded by Deacon Rees. When their numbers increased sufficiently about Granville, they ceased attending the old church, and organized one of their own. In 1828 they erected a brick church in the west part of town, upon the present site of Professor A. M. Thresh er's residence, and since that time have erected a frame church on the public square, opposite the Congregational church, and disposed of the old brick building. From the record dated June 6, r8i9, the follow ing names appear as the first members of the church: Levi Nichols, James Hair, Abraham Chandler, Sanford Castile, Timothy Spellman, jr., Thomas Green, David Adams, Salome Squire, Mary Atwood, Philander Jewett, Sarah Crow, Mary Drake, Rhoda Burnet, Annie Chandler, Jerusha Baker, Sarah Kelly, Betsy Case, Lovina Woods and Polly Phelps. After Chaplain Jones, Elder George Evans was probably the first preacher for the congregation. He continued his ministerial labors from the or ganization of the church until October 26, 1822. He was a missionary from Massachusetts. At the above date, he was succeeded by Elder John Han over, who preached until 1825, and was succeeded by Elders DeBolt in 1825; Hanks, in 1826; James Berry, in 1828; Allen Darrow, after 1832; Henry Carr, from 1842 to 1847; Silas Bailey and Professor John Pratt, until 1851; Jeremiah Hall, D. D., from 185 1 to 1853; N. S. Burton, eight years; J. D. King, one year; J. C. Fernald, until 1873, and W- C. P. Rhodes to the present date (November, 1880.) The Methodist Episcopal church of Granville, although one of the first organized is, as usual, last to take steps for the preservation of its his tory. No records have been kept until in later years, and consequently its earliest history has dis appeared. Howe's \"Historical Collections\" says : \"In the .fall (probably the fall of 1806, though no date is given) the first Methodist sermon was preached under a black walnut tree; the first class organized in 1810, and the first church erected in 1824.\""], [450, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 440 It has been ascertained that this class organized in 1810 was at the house of William Gavit, by the Rev. James B. Finley. This was then called the Knox circuit. The names of the members of this class do not appear, but the names of the minis ters that immediately succeeded Mr. Finley are Revs. Elisha W. Bowman, 181 1; Michael Ellis, 1812; David Knox, 1813; Samuel West, 1814; John Solomon and John McMahon, 1815; Shad rick Ruark, 18 16; Henry Baker and Philip Green, 181 7; Thomas Carr and Leonard Lane, 18 18, and Thomas Carr and John Solomon, 1819. In 1820 the name of the circuit was changed to Granville. Rev. S. B. Frampton is the present minister, and the church and Sabbath-school are in a flourishing condition. CHAPTER LI.

ONE of the most important legal instruments to the Granville colony was the partition deed, executed by Mr. Samuel Everett. It partitioned the land among the people of the colony, and was signed by seventy-eight proprietors, in the pres ence's, and attested by, Abraham Wright, justice of the peace. It bears date of March 8, 1806, and contains twenty-eight closely written pages of foolscap. It appears upon the records of Fairfield county, and is the most lengthy written instrument of the kind upon the records of the county. It was executed gratuitously by Mr. Everett. He was a ready accountant and good conveyancer. He was the father of Harlow, Revel and Israel Everett. One of the things most needed for the conveni ence and improvement of the country was a saw mill. For the purpose of building one, a mill wright named Phelps, and four men as assistants, had been sent out to the purchase in the spring of 1805. They came in company with Mr. Coe and his surveying corps. A site near where the old furnace stood was selected, and a temporary mill erected. They dammed the Raccoon for the pur pose of procuring a supply of water, but evidently they did not understand damming a western stream in a new country, and the first freshet swept it away. The mill was abandoned before it was ready for operations. This was a drawback and disappointment to the colony; and from this cause more light and transient dwellings were erected than otherwise would have been. By the fall of 1806, a saw-mill had been erected further down the stream by Augustine Munson, with a capacity of four thousand feet per day. A reasonable supply of lumber to meet the wants of the colony was now to be had, and the heavier and more substantial structures began to be erected. The first farm house was built by Deacon, after ward Judge, Timothy Rose, in the winter of 1806-7, and stood where Judge Bancroft afterward resided. The first (forty by fifty) frame barn built in the"], [451, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 441 county was erected in this township in the spring of 1807. The boards enclosing it were nailed on with Newgate nails, made in the Connecticut State prison. Most of the boards and nails are yet in their places. The first male child born in the Granville colony was a son of Levi and Polly Rose, who became the well known Deacon William Rose. The first female child was the daughter of Justin and Adah Hillyer, afterward the wife of Deacon E. C. Wright. May 12, 1807, the first marriage was celebrated. The parties were Samuel Bancroft and Clarissa, eldest daughter of Judge Rose. It was the frequent remark of strangers and visitors to Granville in those early days, that no pioneer settlement in the west could boast of so many marriageable and desirable young ladies as could Granville. In 1807 an epidemic swept away a large number of young folks. A burying-ground was laid out in the company's first survey. The first death and burial was that of an infant son of Ethan Bancroft, who died April 6, 1806. On the twenty-second of August of the same year, Gideon Cromwell died, aged forty-five, and was the first interment of an adult person in this graveyard. The pioneers of Granville early paid attention to the cultivation of music, both vocal and instru mental. Singing schools, to learn church music, were held as early as the fall of 1806; and at all their social parties singing was part of the enter tainment. As early as 1808, a band for instru mental music was organized; it consisted of eleven performers; three clarionets, three hautboys, three bassoons, one bass drum and cymbal. This was the first band west of Pittsburgh, if not of the Alleghanies. It was the band of Cass' regiment in the War of 1812, and was in Hull's surrender at Detroit. In the formation of the Granville colony an effort was made to have the professional and mechanical pursuits represented as far as possible, so that among these pioneers men were found for almost any work or duty required, and they were, therefore, better fitted in all respects to enjoy life than the majority of western pioneers, and their progress was, therefore, more rapid toward the ac cumulation of material and intellectual wealth. In the spring of 1807 Dr. Lee settled in Granville, the first physician in this part of the county. He mar ried Sabina, eldest daughter of Job Case, and subse quently removed to Coshoeton. He was followed by Drs. Richards and Eager, men of general edu cation and professional skill. One of these was a regular graduate of Dartmouth and the other of a literary institution in Rhode Island. Granville has never been without medical men who would adorn that piofession in any age or community. The first court ever held in the county was held on Centerville street, in this township, in a house that stood on the corner of Levi Rose's garden. The grand jury held its inquest under a tree that stood near the guide post that points to Hebron. Mr. William Wing was a resident of Granville township from 1818 to 1827, and has furnished some valuable history of early times here. He died in Columbus, Ohio, February 13, 1878, in his seventy-ninth year. He came to Licking county from Windsor, Connecticut, settling in Granville in 1818, where he married Electa Spell man in 1822. He was a merchant, a canal con tractor and, later in life, engaged in railroad busi ness. He was well acquainted with the pioneer history of central Ohio, and was often called upon to address pioneer gatherings. A few extracts fol lowing are taken from the few of these addresses which appear in print : \"From i8i8to 1822 money was exceedingly scarce and pro duce low. The inhabitants had to live chiefly on what they were able to raise and manufacture themselves. Business of most kinds was conducted by exchanging one article for another. It was next to impossible to get money to pay debts. About this time a stay law was enacted by the legislature which virtu ally suspended the forced collections of debt for some time. Pro duce would scarcely pay enough for transportation to any market that was accessible. As an instance of this a company was formed at Granville, about the year 1820, called the \"Licking Exporting Company,\" for the purpose of sending produce, especially pork, to market. The hogs were put into control of the company by the farmers, driven to Sandusky, there slaught ered, packed and shipped in the spring to Montreal. Mr. C. Humphrey supervised the shipment, and went to Canada and made sales. About one dollar and twenty-five cents per hun dred was realized for the pork, and the operations of the com pany were not repeated. 1 ' The prices of some articles of produce, about that time, were about as follows : Wheat, twenty-five to thirty-seven and one-half cents per bushel ; oats and corn, from twelve and one-"], [452, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 442 ers, collected together, went to the depository where considerable accumulations of them were, and gathering them up, formed a procession, and with muffled drums and fife marched to a cross street in the east part of the town and buried them. Shortly after a number of subscribers took produce of various kinds to Newark to pay their subscriptions and stop the paper. Briggs published in his next issue an article in regard to the matter, attempting to ridicule the people, and there the matter ended ; but the Advocate, after that time, never had much circulation there while he conducted it. \"After this a press was obtained by Mr. Sereno Wright, who was a practical printer, and the publication of a newspaper was commenced by himself, called the Wanderer. ' Uncle Sereno, ' as he was familiarly called, was considered a very honest, up right man, but somewhat eccentric in character. Many stories used to be told of his peculiar ways in dealing with his custom ers in his store, which he kept about this time. It is probable they were not true, or if they were, they were not to his preju dice, but only illustrative of his eccentricities. He afterward sen-ed as county treasurer a number of years with great accep tability. The Jackson party finally became dominant in the countv and he was obliged to give way.\" The Wanderer spoken of by Mr. Wing, was es tablished in 1822, and was the second paper start ed in the county. It was devoted to news, adver tising, and the interests of the little village in which it was published. It was small in size, con tained little reading matter, and was issued by \"Uncle Sereno,\" and one of his boys. The latter fell down stairs one day, seriously injuring himself, which circumstance led to the suspension of the Wanderer. This was about two years after it started. Newspapers were not in great demand in this county in the days of the Wanderer. Probably the next paper started in Granville was the Granville Intelligencer in 1847, by D. Hunt and H. C. Blackman. Mr. James Taylor may also have been connected with the Ititelligencer before its name was changed to the Licking Bee in 185 1, as it was afterward. , These papers were devoted to the interests of Granville, were well conducted, well printed and exerted a good influence. The Bee advocated the Maine Law in 1853, and was always strongly for temperance. Both of these papers were indepen dent in politics. The Denisonian, a literary periodical, conducted by the students of the Denison university, was commenced in 1857. Henry Fulton, H. E. Jones, J. B. Shaff I. M. Clemens, J. H. Sedwickand J. B. Jones appear as editors, at different times. It was a clever publication, but died in 1859, and was half to twenty cents ; flour, from one dollar to one dollar and twenty-five cents per hundred weight ; pork, one dollar and fifty cents to two dollars ; chickens, thirty-seven and one-half to fifty cents per dozen , butter, six to eight cents per pound ; eggs, three to four cents per dozen ; country sugar, six to eight cents per pound ; country molasses fifty cents per gallon (no foreign sugar or molasses to be had); coffee, when obtainable, about fifty cents, and tea two dollars and fifty cents to three dollars per pound. Salt retailed for three dollars and fifty cents per bushel ; whiskey, twenty-five cents per gallon ; potatoes and tur nips, twelve and one-half to sixteen cents per bushel, and other articles in proportion. Even at these prices money could not be obtained freely for them, there being no other than a home market. Merchandise and goods of all kinds could be obtained only with great difficulty. The stores were bare of the real necessaries for the people, and all had to depend on their own resources. \"From 1822 to 1825, there was a gradual improvement, mer chants at Granville purchased the farmers' hogs and cattle, drove them to an eastern market and returning furnished the people with merchandise suitable to their wants. From that time the inhabitants were better accommodated, and the par ties engaged in the business were benefitted and eminently suc cessful. The working of the Granville furnace by the same parties successfully, afforded a market for considerable of the produce raised by the farmers. \"Beginning work on the Ohio canal in 1825, gave an im petus to business, furnishing a home market for much of the surplus labor and produce of the county. Great advances and changes soon took place. The people of Granville felt much interest in that work, expecting to derive much benefit from the proposed side cut, or feeder. Meetings of rejoicing were had upon the passage of the law, speeches were made, toasts of fered and good feeling prevailed. A toast given by Judge Alexander Holmes, of Newark, was as follows: 'The Licking summit \u2014 we are indebted to her depression for this day's eleva tion.' A well known citizen, Chauncey Humphrey, in the height of his joy made this remark in relation to the prospects of Granville: 'We shall be a second Utica.' \"But the expectation of advantages to be derived from the side cut to Granville, does not appear to have been realized, as it has been useless for purposes of navigation many years. However, the people were generally benefited by the prosecution of the work. \"From the day of the beginning of the canal (July 4, 1825,) we may date the rapid advancement of the county and State in wealth, prosperity and all the material elements which go to make a happy and prosperous people. \"The Newark Advocate, published by Mr. Briggs, at New ark, was commenced in the year 1820. A good subscription list was obtained for the paper at Granville; the papers were sent to a depository there by a carrier, for the subscribers. To fill up his columns the publisher commenced publishing the life of Patrick Henry in weekly installments. Some of the sub scribers became dissatisfied. About this time Augustine Mun son was a candidate for the legislature; some one was sent to the Advocate office to get tickets printed with Munson's name on them. Mr. Briggs, not favoring Munson's election it was thought, declined to print them, assigning as a reason that he had so much printing on hand he could not do it in time. Of course the parties were not pleased, and having been dissatis fied with his paper before, a number of the subscribers and oth-"], [453, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY 443 buried with literary honors, J. B. Jones delivering the funeral oration. The Herbarium was a literary periodical issued in Granville, in the interest of one of the literary institutions of that place. It was the cotemporary of the Denisonian, and lived as long at least, per haps longer. It was conducted, probably, by the young ladies of Mr. Kerr's seminary. The Collegian, a magazine of thirty-two pages, was started by the members of the Calliopean Literary society of Denison university, in July, 1867, with Thomas Ewart, F Catworthy, and F. Austin Drew as editors, and H. A. Rogers and C. M. Rupe publishers. It was published by this society two years. In 1869, the Franklin Literary society united with the Calliopeans in its publica tion, and from the commencement of the third volume it was issued as the Denison Collegian, and under the auspices of these societies it is ably conducted. The Granville Times, a weekly Republican paper, was established in June, 1880, by Harry A. Church, the first number appearing on Friday, June n. The paper is a five column folio, and is principally devoted to the interests of Granville township. It has been placed upon a paying basis, and is a welcome sheet to almost every family in the town ship. Although supporting the principles of the Republican party, it is liberally encouraged by men of both parties, Rev. A. Y. Yale, of Alexandria, now prints a periodical in the Times office. It is noticed in the chapter on St. Albans township. Mr. Wing's paper is again quoted: \"Of the first pioneers who were living in 1S18, Joseph Lin nel, sr., Levi Rose, Deacon Levi Hayes, Roswell Graves, Job Case, Samuel and Azariah Bancroft, Justin Hillyer, sr., Timo thy Spellman, Elias Gilman, Silas Winchel, William Gavit, Amos Carpenter, and Hiram Rose, are remembered \u2014 all now dead. \"Of the descendants of the first settlers and others residing there at the time are recollected the following : Augustine, Jere miah R. and Jesse Munson, Spencer Wright, Elkanah Linnel, Grove Case, Curtis, Amara, and Daniel Howe, Benjamin and Ja cob Cook, Oren and Ralph Granger, David and Campbell Mes senger, A. P. Pritchard, Elias Fassett, Willard Warner, Hiram and Samuel Boardman, Jacob Apollos Griffin, the Mower fam ily (father and sons), and many others whose names are not now recalled. \"The first postmaster at Granville was Judge Rose ; the next, William Gavit. Sereno Wright succeeded him and was post master there in 1818, and so remained many years. \"The physicians in practice were W. S. Richards and a Dr. Moulton. Dr. Sylvester Spellman settled there about 1820, and was in practice many years. Some other physicians came there but did not remain long. \"At an early period an act of the legislature incorporated the Granville Alexandrian society. It was supposed the law con ferred banking powers, accordingly a bank was established about i8r4 or 1815. \"The banking house was a one-story stone building, and stood at the southeast corner of Broad street and the public square. It issued circulating notes and did a general banking business.^ I am not certain who its first directors and officers were, but believe Elias Gilman, Silas Winchel, and Timothy Spellman, residents of Granville, were of the board, wiih Alex ander Holmes, of Newark, as president, and R..R. Roach, as cashier. Subsequently G. Swan was cashier, and he was suc ceeded by Elisha S. Gilman. This was, no doubt, the first banking institution in the county. \" In 1817, in common with other banks in the State, such as the Owl Creek bank of Mt. Vernon, and others, the bank failed to redeem its notes, and suspended payment, when its notes greatly depreciated. In 1836 the bank was revived, principally by Buffalo parties. Henry Roop was made president, and A. G. Hammond cashier. Mr. Hammond did not continue long, and A. J. Smith succeeded him. Mr. Roop retired from the presidency after a time, when his place was supplied by some person interested in the bank in Granville. The public did not have great confidence in this bank, its issues not being in much favor, and it suspended payment in 1841. Its business was wound up by order of the court, and, I believe, some of its stockholders were made individually liable for its outstanding notes. \"The Granville furnace was built in 1816, by J. R. and A. Munson. It was supposed that ore could be obtained about four miles west of Granville. This proved to be a mistake, and the ore had to be transported by wagon from Mary Ann town ship, and other places, distant twelve or sixteen miles. After the completion of the canal ore was obtained from Zoar, in Tuscarawas county. The operations of the furnace were not successful until it passed into the hands of L. D. Mower and his associates in 1822 or 1823, when it became profitable. In 1825 Elias Fassett purchased the interest of L. D. Mower & Co., and carried on the business some years. From 1830 to 1838 the persons interested in it were Elias Fassett, Alfred Avery, P. W. Taylor, Elizur Abbott, Simeon Reed, D. L. Cook, and D. D. Jewett. It was finally abandoned in 1838. \"A forge was built by A. Munson on Raccoon creek, two miles from town, and worked for a time with partial success; it was built about the time the furnace was erected. Colonel A. Jewett worked it in 1824 and 1825, but was unsuccessful. A. Munson had a grist and saw-mill on the site of the forge; Grove Case had a grist-mill on Clear run, adjoining the town on the east. ' ' Distilleries were common. The parties operating them were Joseph Fassett, Roval Marsh, Silas Winchell, and another name not recollected, about a mile and a half west of town. \"The Ohio canal opened a market for much of the whiskey manufactured ; price twelve and a half cents per gallon by the barrel. \"A saw-mill was carried on by Captain John Phelps, about three-fourths of a mile southeast of town. He will be remem bered by some of the older residents as going by the name of \"Captain Put.\" He became partially deranged about 1824,"], [454, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 444 \"Linnel, French & Brace had a clock factoiy five miles west of Granville, and had several men in their employ. In 1825 or 1826, Franklin county was a part of the congressional district, and Lyne Starling, of Columbus, was a candidate for Congress. He came to Granville on an electioneering excursion, and was introduced to the people as a candidate to represent them. Hearing of the clock factory he wished me to go there with him, which I did. After spending some time with the princi pals, as we were about leaving, he inquired the price of a clock, and directed them to send him one; it was sent to my care and forwarded to him at Columbus. He paid for the clock, but whether he received the votes of the parties or their employes I do not know, but he was not elected. The clock factory was afterward removed to Granville, and stood north of the building now occupied by the First National bank of Granville, and carried on by French & Brace, Mr. Linnel having withdrawn. \"The kind of clock manufactured by them was the old fash ioned Yankee clock. \"From 1818 to 1828 the attention of the people was called to military matters, Regimental and company musters were regu larly kept up. There were three uniformed companies, one of infantry, one of artillery and one of cavalry, commanded re spectively by Captains Timothy Spellman, jr., Willard Warner and P. W. Taylor. There were also two companies of militia ('flood-woods' and 'barefoots'), one in the south part of the township, commanded by Captain Myron Phelps, and one in the north part commanded by Captain Alpheus Jewett, who afterward became colonel of the regiment. The writer had not much military taste, but was appointed pay master of the regi ment, and was mustered as such, but is not aware that any money came into his hands, wherewith to make any payments. \"The first and only cannon ever made in the county was cast at the Granville furnace, for the artillery company, and bored out in a stable near where the clock factory stood, and mounted for the company. It was used at the celebration at Licking Summit in 1825, at the beginning of the Ohio canal. \"In 1818 Griffin & Humphrey had a stock of goods in the store next east of the old bank building. Mr. Humphrey sold his interest to Elisha S. Gilman, the firm then being Griffin & Gilman. They did not replenish the stock, and soon gave up the business. Matthew Adams, jr., had a stock of goods in 1819, or 1820, but I do not recollect who was concerned with him. His store was next west of R. Granger's tavern; but he was not successful, and the business was closed up. Fitch & King opened a stock of goods, and, I believe, Matthew Adams, jr., assisted them; but they did not remain long. Sereno Wright kept some articles of merchandise in part of his dwelling, south west corner of the public square; and the post office was kept there, he being postmaster. \"Charles Sawyer came to Granville in 1817. He was a sad dler by trade, and carried on the business in a small, red build ing, on the lot now occupied by Doctor Spellman's dwelling house. In 1819 or 1820 he began keeping some articles of mer chandise, and from small beginnings and close attention to business, he had accumulated considerable property by the year 1830. At or about this time he became a zealous member of the Baptist church, and felt it his duty to contribute liberally of his means towards the enterprises of his church, one of which was the building of a female seminary, with a spacious boarding house attached. The buildings were located in the northwestern part of town. The seminary was occupied and well patronized. travelled about from place to place, and when he came into a town he would call his roll, naming persons whose names he had obtained. I recollect hearing him call it one day in Granville. What became of him I do not know, but have the impression that he wandered off to the State of New York, or some of the New England States, from whence he came, and died. \"An oil-mill was built at an early day on Clear run, north of town, near the Welsh Hills road. It was run for a time but soon discontinued. Two tanneries were in operation in 1818, one carried on by Spencer Wright, near Clear run, east of town, and the other by George Donnovan on a lot afterward occupied by Harvey Bragg, near the spring. \"A salt well was sunk some hundreds of feet, about three fourths of a mile southwest of town at an old deer-lick. Salt water was reached and a furnace erected to make salt, but on testing the water, two bushels of salt per day was all that could be made, and the enterprise was abandoned. Another well was commenced on Moat's run, in St. Albans township, but did not come to anything. I think these enterprises were undertaken in 1822 or 1823. \"There were four ponds of standing water on the town plat; one at the junction of Broad street and the Columbus road, one on the north side of the public square; one in the street fronting the house occupied by Rev. Mr. Little, and the other north of Broad street, and west of the street leading north toward Mt. Vernon. By voluntary labor contributed by the people in town and country, they were filled up and drained in 1826, and the unsightly nuisances abated. \"The old burying ground south of town, containing some twelve or fifteen acres, was first surrounded with a wooden fence, which became decayed. In 1820 the inhabitants turned out and built a good, substantial wall around the lot, which still remains. A new cemetery has been established and dedica ted in the past few years, southeast of the town plat. \"There were two or three woollen factories in the township at an early day. The original proprietors were William Paige, Horace Wolcott, James Mead, and Linus G. Thrall; there may have been others whose names are not remembered. \"The people of the township and county were supplied with plows made at Granville. The first manufactured was the \"bull plow,\" so called; the woodwork made by the Blanchards, and the iron (all wrought) by Colonel Alpheus Jewett, and afterwards by Allen Sinnet, Hugh Kelley and others. The Blanchards and Woodbury also built wagons, carts and other things. \"In 1831 a Mr. Bunker, from Troy, New York, started, on the site of the old forge referred to, an extensive manufaciory of plows, of the \"Wood's patent.\" They were of cast iron, so far as iron was used. These plows came into general use; had a wide market, and gave great satisfaction. \"A very considerable business was carried on from 1820 to 1825, in quarrying and cutting stone for building purposes, also grave stones, by Josiah Taylor, P. W. Taylor, and others. Several teams were kept running in the country peddling grave stones, and it is supposed that those engaged in the business did well. \"The first lodge of Free Masons in Licking county was in stituted at Granville, called \"Center Star.\" It had members from all parts of the county, and had a Royal Arch chapter. I believe it still continues in working order. \"The people were foremost in the county in the formation of a temperance society iu 1828."], [455, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 445 Mr. Sawyer having contributed so freely of his own means, be came embarrassed and was obliged to take the building and its surroundings in payment of his advances on account of it, and to relieve himself was obliged to sell it to the Episcopal church, but did not realize near what he had paid out. He lemoved to Newark soon after, in 185a to Columbus, and from thence to Springfield, Illinois. \"About 1822 L. D. Mower commenced merchandising, built a new brick store-house on the south side of the street, between the houses occupied by Doctor Spellman and Dr. Paul Eagar. His brother, Horatio, and Alfred Avery were associated with him; and after Horatio's death his brother Sherlock was a part ner. Mr. Mower also worked the furnace until he disposed of his interest in that enterprise to E. Fassett, as before mentioned. Afterward A. P. Pritchard was a partner of his in the sale of goods in 1830, under the firm name of Mower & Pritchard. Mr. Mower was a very thorough business man, and a man of great energy and perseverance, and acquired a handsome prop erty. He died in 1834 or 1835. \"A. P. Pritchard was probably the first druggist in the county. He had a chemical establishment or labratory in connection with the drug business, near ihe spring, in the northwest part of town. \"Other parties were engaged in merchandising from 1820 to 1838, whose names are as follows: Elias Fassett, Alfred Avery P. W. Taylor, D. R. Cook, Elmer Abbott, Doctor Sylvester Spellman, Simeon Reed, D. D. Jewett and George Abbott. Some of these parties were also engaged in the furnace, their names appearing in a former paragraph. It is supposed that these gentlemen were generally successful in their undertakings. A steam flouring mill was built near the furnace in 183 1, by P. W. Taylor & Co. After the feeder had been finished to Gran ville, the mill was removed to the site of the old Phelps saw mill, before referred to. \"In 1832 the question was agitated of building a new court house. The people of Granville became much ex cited on the subject, and made great efforts to get the county seat removed to this place, offering to build the county build ings without charge to the county, or contribute largely thereto. Newark, however, being in posssssion, and being on the main line of the canal, overcame the enterprise of the Granvillians, and the county seat remained at Newark, and the people of Newark were not required to contribute anything to retain it. \"The Granville feeder extended from Licking summit to Raccoon creek at Paige's woollen factory, about a mile and a quarter southeast of town. In order to have navigation as near the town as possible, the canal commissioners agreed to make the feeder navigable for boats to Paige's factory, provided the people of Granville would make it navigable from thence to the bridge al the Lancaster road. This they agreed to do. It in volved a considerable expense, as a dam, guard-lock, lift-lock, and about half a mile of canal had to be bnilt to render it nav igable. \"A warehouse was erected at the head of navigation, and a boat built there by the Troy and Ohio line, under the superin tendence of a Mr. Wallace, and it is supposed that it was the first canal-boat built south of Cleveland. The feeder was nav igated until the furnace was abandoned in 1838, since which it has become dilapidated and out of repair. \"During the construction of the canal, many of the citizens were engaged as contractors on the work, among whom were A. Munson, L. D. Mower, P. W. Taylor, Sylvester Hayes, Levi Rose, Alfred Avery, Elias Fassett, Joseph Fassett, Sim eon Reed, Byron Hayes, William Wing, Justin Hillyer, jr., Curtis Howe, Ashley A. Bancroft, Hugh and Dennis Kelley. Several of the above had large contracts, and they generally enjoyed the confidence of the canal commissioners. I have no doubt that more of such work was done by these people than was done by the people of any other township or county in the State. So far as I know, it is believed their contracts were generally remunerative. \"A water-cure was established in 1852, by Dr. W. W. Ban croft. The establishment was well patronized from the first, and has been very successful in the treatment of chronic and other diseases.* \"In the late war for the suppression of the Rebellion, it is understood that the people of Granville patriotically responded to the calls of the Government, in all cases filling their quotas, and contributing in every possible way to aid and assist those and the families of those who were called to the front. Several of the Granville boys shed their blood and lost their lives in the service of the country, and in defence of free institutions. In a paper read on the Fourth of July, 187 1, at Utica, Mr. Wing continues : \"Revel Everett was a Granville man. I remember him as be ing constable of the township. Afterwards he removed to Hartford, and for a time was engaged in merchandising and where he has continued to reside ever since. \"David Messenger, of the committee, I recognize as an old familiar friend, one whom I have known about as long as any other in the State, he being a resident of Granville when I ar rived. He was a shoemaker by trade. I think he did not take kindly to it, or the business did not suit him. He acquired con siderable reputation as a player on the violin, and at the first dancing party I attended, six days after my arrival, he was one of the musicians who made music for the dance. The other player was Fish, of Johnstown, and their 'Money Musk,' 'Fisher's Hornpipe,' and other tunes for country dances were not often excelled. About i82r he came to Utica and engaged in merchandising, and continued the business some years. \" I believe none of the first settlers of Granville township now survive. There are few townships in the county whose repu tation is as good as that of Granville, or one that has done more for the advancement of good morals and public and pri vate enterprises.\" In his paper read on the Fourth of July, 1872, at Newark, he says: \"Oren and Ralph Granger, brothers, each kept a tavern in Granville, and kept good houses. Oren died in 1821 or 1822 ; Ralph continued in the same business at times until 1830, when he removed to his farm, and died about 1866. Willard Warner kept a tavern in Granville four or five years and removed thence to Newark, where he kept at the Houston stand some time. He was a mail contractor and represented Licking county in the senate one term. \"Major J. R. Munson was by profession a lawyer, and was a man of good natural ability ; was a representative in the legis lature when it met at Chillicothe, and was said to have been instrumental in obtaining the charter of the Granville Alexan drian society, which, it was supposed, conferred banking *This institution went out of existence two or three years ago."], [456, "446 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. powers. He was not fortunate in his business enterprises, and died in r82r or 1822. ' ' Elias Fassett, before mentioned as a business man ot Gran ville, removed to Cleveland and thence to New York, engaging first in the dry goods business, then in brokerage, dealing in bonds and stocks until 1856, when he returned to his farm near Granville ; was elected president of the Central Ohio railroad company, holding the position some two years, and retiring to his farm, where he died suddenly in 1863.\" In the early days of the agitation of the slavery question \u2014 between 1825 and 1840 \u2014 when an abo litionist was something of a curiosity in this coun ty, Granville had her share of them, and her share of trouble in consequence. Quite an anti-slavery society was organized in that place, and although they dare do or say nothing openly for some years, they grew bolder by degrees, and began to hold meetings and have public speaking upon that all important subject. The men of Granville gener ally had minds and thoughts of their own upon all subjects, and Puritan blood was generally largely impregnated with abolition blood. Something was done here on the under-ground railway, and there were a few zealous workers in the abolition cause at all times, and their numbers continually increased. A majority of the people were, how ever, pro-slavery, as they were everywhere in the North. About April 1, 1835, a Mr. Weld, an abolition ist, undertook to deliver a lecture in Granville, and was stoned and egged by a mob. He had lectur ed a few days before at Circleville,' where he had also received rough treatment; the mob throwing eggs and stones thiough the window. 1 ' One of the stones was so well aimed that it struck me on the head, and, for a moment, stunned me. I paused a few moments until the dizziness had ceased, and then went on, and finished my lecture. Meanwhile, some of the gentlemen had hung their cloaks up at the window, so that my head could not be so easily used as a target.\" The above extract is from a letter written by Mr. Weld at the time, and is evidence of what an abolition lecturer had to endure. In the following year, 1836, the following notice appeared in the Newark Gazette: \"We, citizens of the town of Granville, in the county of Licking, and State of Ohio, having understood from common report, and from certain notices published in newspapers, that a State convention of delegatesfrom the Abolition societies of Ohio is to be held in this place on the twenty-seventh day of April, ensuing ; and having had bitter experience, in times past, of the evil effects of abolition meetings, as tending to destroy the peace of society, and introduce discord and contention through all its constituent departments ; and learning that a great and increasing excitement already exists, not only in our own, but in the neighboring towns, in prospect of the contemplated meeting \u2014 we do, therefore, most earnestly remonstrate against any such meeting being held in our town on the twenty-seventh day of April, or any other day in the year. And we most ear nestly call upon and request all officers and leaders of the aboli tion society, and all who are, or may be, appointed delegates to the said convention, if they have the least regard for our peace and welfare, or for the well-being of the religious, moral, and literary iustitutions established among us, to abstain from com ing to said meeting. And we do hereby engage to use our best endeavors, by all lawful and proper means, to prevent any such public meeting from being held within the limits of our corporation. \"Granville, March 31, 1836.\" This notice was signed by Elias Fassett, mayor; Samuel Bancroft, recorder; William S. Richards, Knowles Linnel, S. Spellman, S. Mower, Daniel Wildman, council, and by sixty-nine other citizens. Notwithstanding this, the abolitionists held their meeting, though not, it seems, within the corpora tion. Mr. Briggs, in an editorial published in the Advocate, April 30, 1836, thus gives the result, heading his article \"Bloody Wars in Canada:\" \"The abolition convention adjourned on Thursday about noon. The day was distinguished by violence and bloodshed, though fortunately no lives were lost. \" On Wednesday evening, the abolitionists held a meeting in a school-house, about a mile south of Granville. During the evening a mob collected, and broke the windows with stones. They were driven off by the abolitionists. They dispatched expresses during the night to Martinsburgh, Utica, Mount Vernon and Newark, for re-inforcements, and accordingly a number of recruits were in the field on the next day, armed with clubs and ready for action. \"Twelve o'clock on Thursday was the time fixed upon for the commencement of hostilities. The convention adjourned about that time, and many of the members accompanied by ladies, formed a procession about a mile from the village where the convention sat, and marched through the principal streets, where the mob was assembled. When they reached that point, the mob commenced hissing and yelling, and followed the pro cession to the ladies' academy, where the ladies left the proces sion; and then both parties resorted to clubs, dirks and brick bats, which they employed as knock-'em down arguments for and against the abolition scheme. The fighting continued at inter vals for some time. One of the mob was dirked, and some of the abolitionists were knocked down with clubs, and one was pelted with eggs most unmercifully. Three abolition horses\" manes and tails were closely shaved.'' In another part of the same issue, Mr. Briggs says: \"We are told that upwards of four thousand dollars were"], [457, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 447 contributed by the abolitionists at Granville on Wednesday night, to support a press that is about to be established at Cin cinnati, and to defrav the expense of printing abolition tracts.\" It will be seen from the above that both parties were very determined, and that the abolitionists were especially wide-awake, active, belligerent, in earnest, and ready with brain, muscle and money to further their cause. Thirty years from that time their cause emerged from the smoke, dust and blood of battle, triumphant. The following regarding Granville is from Howe's Collections: \"When Granville was first settled it w-as supposed that Worthington would be the capital of Ohio, between which and Zanesville this would make a great half-way town. At this time, snakes, wolves and Indians abounded in this region. On pleasant spring mornings, large numbers of snakes were found running on the flat stones. Upon prying up the stones, there was revealed a singular fact respecting the social nature of ser pents. Dens were found containing very discordant materials. twenty or thirty rattle-snakes, black-snakes and copper-heads, all coiled up together. Their liberal terms of admission only seemed to require evidence of snakeship. Besides various turnouts to kill them, the inhabitants had one general hunt. Elias Gillman and Justin Hillyer were the captains, who chose sides, and the party beaten were to pay three gallons of whis key. Tradition is divided as to the number killed that day; some say three hundred. They killed that year between seven and eight hundred rattle-snakes and copper-heads, keeping no account of the black and other harmless serpents. The young men would seize them by the neck and thrash them against the trees, before they had time to bite or coil around their arms. The copper-head, though smaller, was much more feared. The rattle-snake was larger, sooner seen and a true southerner, always living up to the laws of honor. He would not bite without provocation, and by his rattles gave the challenge in an honorable way. Instead of this well-bred warfare the copper head is a wrathy little fellow, whose ire is always up, and he will make at the hand or the foot in the leaves or grass, before he is seen, and his bite is as poisonous as that of his brother of the larger fang. The young men tested his temper and found that in his wrath he would bite a red hot coal. Very few were bitten by the rattle-snake, and all speak well of his good dispo sition and gentlemanly manners; but so many were bitten in consequence of the fractious temper of the copper-head, that he has left no one behind him to sound a note in his praise. \"The limb bitten became immediately swollen, turned the color of the snake', and the patient was soon unable to walk. In some cases the poison broke out annually, and in others the limb for years was inclined to frequent swellings. After all that was suffered from poisonous reptiles, it was proved to a demonstration that no animal is so poisonous as man. Carry ing more poison in his mouth than any other creature, he can poison a venomous serpent to death quicker than the serpent can him. Martin Root and two other young men, chopping together, saw a rattle-snake, set a fork over his neck, and put into his mouth a new quid from one of their mouths. They raised the fork, and the poor creature did not crawl more than his length before he convulsed, swelled up and died, poisoned to death by virus from the mouth of one of the lords of crea tion. Deacon Hayes and Worthy Pratt tried the same experi ment upon copper-heads, with the same result. Many others killed venomous reptiles in the same way, and one man pre tended that by moderate use he had taught a copper-head to take tobacco without injury. \" Of the adult pioneers of the Granville colony who came here in 1805, all are dead; a few of their children, however, whom they brought here at that date are yet living. Among them are Franklin and Ezekiel Gavitt, who live in Delaware county ; Timothy M. Rose, yet living in Granville; Hiram P. Rose, living in Indiana; Justin and Truman Hilliar; Justin in Kansas and Truman in Colum bus, Ohio. Sylvanus and Gideon Cornel are probably living. Leverett and Charles Butler are yet living in this county. The Center Star lodge, Free and Accepted Ma sons, spoken of in Mr. Wing's paper as being first in the county, was organized by Mr. Job Case, Timothy Spellman, Justin Hillier, David Butler, and Elias Gilman. These gentlemen having received the degrees of symbolic Masonry in New England, united with a few others and presented a petition to Lewis Cass, grand master of Masons in Ohio, early in 1810, praying for a dispensation to organize a lodge in Granville. Mr. Cass came to Granville in person and organized the lodge, in the upper room of the dwelling of Deacon Timothy Rose. The 'odge was chartered in January, 181 1, and num bered eleven persons. Its first officers were; Job Case, worthy master; Timothy Spellman, senior warden, and Noble Landon, junior warden. The first place of meeting was a room in the second story of the residence of Elias Gilman, finished off for that purpose. The first Masonic hall in the county was ten by fourteen and a half feet in size. It had a window on the east side, a fire-place on the west side, and was the first room finished off and plastered in Granville. About a year after the organization of the lodge, a larger and more con venient room was secured in the residence of Grove Case. The first candidate initiated in this lodge was Hiram Rose. The first return to the Grand lodge included 1810 and 181 1, and showed a membership of twenty Master Masons, and, at the end of 1812, the membership had increased to thirty-nine."], [458, "448 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. sequently Mr. Sanford died and willed the works to the town, one of the conditions being that the town should pay to the Episcopal church one hun dred dollars per annum. One of the woollen factories, mentioned by Mr. Wing, stood about one and one-fourth miles below Granville on Raccoon creek, and was destroyed by fire about 1840. Another building was erected and used as a woollen factory until 1856. Subse quently, about 1857, Noah Clouse established the present machine shop in this building. The firm is Noah Clouse & Son, and they have conducted this business successfully to the present time. Granville, however, lays no claim to being an unusual manufacturing or business place. There are several manufacturing establishments within the limits of the place, among which are the mar ble works, the planing mills of Jones Brothers and of Pratt Brothers. Both these firms make and deal largely in furniture. There are three dry goods stores, kept by George Parsons, Henry Green, and Mr. Craig; two grocery stores, kept by Carter & Carter and H. L Reed; one drug store, kept by Charles Bryant f one hardware store, kept by Jones Brothers; two banks, one national and one private; two newspapers, two hotels, and the usual number of smaller establishments. The trades and professions are also well represented. It does not appear that it is money and business that these people are living for; the whole com munity is deeply religious, highly educated, and, as one prominent educator expressed it, they are \" interested in what the human mind can accom plish.\" The nearest lodges to Granville, in those days, were at Worthington, Mt. Vernon, and Zanesville. The first death in the lodge was that of James Thrall, in 1813. The \"fourth step in Masonry \" was introduced into this lodge June 30, 1814, and Timothy Spell man was passed to the chair of King Solomon. Center Star lodge went down in 1837, but was resuscitated again in 1850, and has continued in successful operation to the present time. The Granville of the present day is a beautiful, pleasant, healthy village, the people being more devoted to religious and educational matters than, perhaps, any other town of its size in the State. About 1850 water works were projected and put in successful operation. Dr. Sinnet and a few other leading citizens were influential in getting these established, and thus giving the town the ad vantage of the purest of spring water. The water was brought from a spring on the farm of Colonel Woods, two miles northwest of town, and con veyed in earthen pipes to a reservoir near the \"Sugar Loaf,\" a conical hill in the western suburbs of the town. From here it is distributed over the town, wherever wanted, in pipes. Those who use the water pay a rental of five dollars a year for an ordinary family. The company that carried these works forward to completion was known as the \"Granville Hy draulic company.\" As an investment, in a finan cial view, it did not pay, and probably its projec tors thought less of making money out of it than of furnishing the inhabitants with pure water. April 13, 1860, the company sold out to Mr. San ford for two hundred and thirty-four dollars; sub-"], [459, "CHAPTER LII. GRANVILLE\u2014 INSTITUTIONS OF LEARNING. An Educational Center \u2014 First Schools and School-Houses \u2014 The Granville Female College \u2014 The Granville Female Institute \u2014 Denison University. CONSIDERING Granville as an educational \\J center, the history of its first schools and school-houses becomes a matter of some impor tance. From the character of the first settlers, who came from the land of schools and churches, it is not surprising that these institutions soon took root in the new settlement, grew and flour ished, and are to-day among the best in the State. The first school-house erected in Granville was in January, 1806, about two months after the arri val of the first detachment of the Granville col ony. It was a rude log building, stood on the site of the Presbyterian church, and was used for church and school purposes. The colony was not much divided in church matters; nearly all be longed to the Congregational church they had organized in Granville, Massachusetts, and 'those who were not regular communicants attended the church and assisted in its support. This log building was used four or five years, when the church wanted a better building for its use and the old log must be taken away. This necessitated the erection of a new school-house. This second building was of brick, and was an imposing struc ture for those times. It stood at the foot of the hill, on Market street, facing Main ; was two sto ries and a basement in height; it was solid and commodious, and did honor to the people. It was probably the first brick house in the village. For many of the first years of its existence, there were not children enough in Granville to fill it, and therefore part of it was rented for other pur poses. The basement was used as a market-house, the upper room, a large hall, was used by the Ma sonic fraternity, and the second floor only was occupied as a school-room. This building was also used some time by the Episcopalians for holding services, before their church was erected. It served all the purposes of a school-house until 1854, when the present union school building was erected. This latter building is situated in the northeastern part of town, is a commodious brick, and probably accommodates two hundred scholars. Five teachers are employed. This is a district school, and the only school in town beside the three colleges. Of these colleges, the first one was established in 1827, by the Congregational church, or in other words, by the Granville colony. Prominent mem bers of the colony were instrumental in establish ing this college, which first went by the name of Granville academy. The building in which this college was established is yet standing. It is a small frame, and when first occupied by the school it stood on the lot now occupied by the residence of Dr. Sinnet. When this institution was first established, it was open for both male and female students. The female department was conducted on the domestic labor plan, the same plan upon which Denison university started out. That class of institutions was popular in those days, the idea being that a young person of either sex should be taught the various branches of labor necessary for them to understand in the battle of life, and those unable to pay their full tuition were thus enabled to earn part of it, and thereby were placed on an equal footing, in educational advantages, with their wealthier classmates. The female depart ment of this school was under charge of Miss Marianne Howe in 1827; in 1828, under Miss Emma Little, and from 1830 to 1834, under the charge respectively of Miss Boardman, Miss Eels, and Miss Eliza Foster. In 1834, Miss Nancy Bridges and Miss Elizabeth Grant were teachers. 445"], [460, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 45\u00b0 time to the present, with the exception of five years, between 1872, and 1877, when it was conducted by others, he has had charge of the college as prin cipal and manager. Very early in its history this school w-as merged into a female academy, the male department being abandoned. Its projectors determined it should become a first class college for the higher education of women. One of its by-laws required that every teacher should be a consistent Christian, the great purpose of its founders being to advance morality and religion. It was established on the Mt. Hol yoke plan, and so continued until 1845, when, under Mr. Moore, it was conducted on the boarding-house plan, and has so continued to the present. The contributors to the erection of the main building in 1837 were citizens of Granville and largely by those who made their money by hard work. This building is quite large, four stories in height and a basement. An addition of brick was made about 1864-5, and tne institution will easily accommodate one hundred students, as regular boarders and lodgers, and fifty or seventy five additional, without lodging. Recently a steam heating apparatus has been placed in the basement, which works to a charm, and the atmosphere of the great building, including all its private and public rooms and labyrinth of halls, is continually kept a pleasant summer temperature, making it a most comfortable and desirable home for the young ladies from all parts of the country who at tend the college. The first floor of the main build ing is occupied by the dining room, the parlors, reception rooms and dwelling rooms of the prin cipal and his family; the second and third floors are principally occupied by the students, their rooms being generally fifteen or twenty feet square, all nicely furnished and finished, and occupied generally by two students each. A few rooms on the second floor of this building are also used as school rooms, the primary school room having its location here. The brick addition is mainly occu pied by the gymnasium, in charge of an efficient teacher, a chapel and recitation room. Every pro vision seems to have been made for the health, comfort and thorough training of the inmates in all that goes to make up the sum of human happi ness. It is probably one of the most complete Miss Bridges became principal in TS36, and re mained such, with her corps of teachers, until 1841. During the first eight or nine years of the early history of this school its managers were compelled to rent school rooms and buildings for their pur pose wherever they could get them; and thus it was that the school was kept in various parts of town. It was not until 1836 that they were ena bled to purchase six lots where the building now stands, of Grove Case, and in 1837 the main build ing (frame) now known as the Granville female college was erected. March 14, 1836, the school was incorporated by the legislature, section first reading as-follows: \"Be it enacted by the general assembly of the State of Ohio: That there shall be, and hereby is established, in the town of Granville, in the county of Licking, an institution for the education of youth in the various branches of useful knowledge, by the name of 'Granville Academy,' and that Rev. Jacob Lit tle, Samuel Bancroft, Spencer Wright, Knowles Linnel, Leon ard Bushnell, William Smedley, Timothy M. Rose, Henry G. Bancoft, Ebenezer Crawford, Edwin C Wright and William W. Bancroft, and their successors, be, and they are hereby ap pointed, trustees of said institution, and made a body corporate and politic, with perpetual succession, to be known by the name and style of 'Trustees of Granville Academy.'\" Other sections followed, but space cannot be al lowed for them. These trustees held their first meeting May 26, 1836, and organized by electing Rev. Jacob Little, president, W. W. Bancroft, sec retary, and Samuel Bancroft, treasurer. Board, in those days, could be had for eighty seven and a half cents per week, and the tuition was four dollars and twenty-five cents per quarter. Upon the expiration of Miss Bridges' term as principal in 184T, Mr. H. R. Gilmore was elected and served one year. August 4, 1842, Miss Han nah O. Bailey was elected principal, assisted by Miss Hamlin. The domestic labor system for students did not work according to the expectations of its friends, and in this institution it was accordingly abandoned February 9, 1844. February n, 1845, William D. Moore rented the academy buildings for three and a half years, at the end of which time he re-rented and continued principal of the school until 1854. May 9th of this year a contract was made with William P. Kerr, the present principal of the college, and from that"], [461, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 45 1 and thoroughly equipped institutions in the coun try for the purposes for which it was designed. The principal, W. P. Kerr, has been untiring in his devotion to the interests of this institution, and it is mainly due to his persevering efforts that the in stitution has been brought to its present proud position among the educational institutions of the State. His attainments in scholarship are of a high order; he is genial, and social, and a pure minded Christian gentleman, to whom' parents may safely trust the education of their daughters.

The*course of study may be pursued' entire or in part, according to the wishes of parents and guardians, or the circumstances of the pupil. German, Greek, French, music and art are op tional. During the course, exercises in reading, spelling and penmanship, reviews of common English blanches, and weekly exercises in composition and the Bible are required of all. One of the most important departments in this college is the musical, at present in charge of Professor G. H. H. C Lowery, M. A., a graduate of the London, Heidelberg and Paris conserva tories \u2014 a gentleman who has made music a lifetime study, who has perfected himself under the best masters in Europe. Granville Female Institute. \u2014 This institu tion was established aboutt 1832, by the Baptist society, the preliminary steps being taken by Mr. Charles Sawyer, then a resident of Granville. He was foremost in contributing of his own means, and obtaining means from others for the erection of the seminary building and boarding-house \u2014 two large frame buildings, occupying beautiful grounds on Main street, in the western part of the town. The following advertisement regarding this college appears in the Neivark Advocate of March 2, 1833: \"Granville Female Seminary.\u2014 In establishing this seminary, it is the object of the trustees to build up a first rate school, suited to the wants of the west. They are happy in now being able to inform the public that they have appointed Mr. James W. Poland, of Massachusetts, who, aided by com petent female teachers, is expected to take its superintendence about April rst. Until the arrival of Mr. Poland, the school, now in successful operation, will continue under the care of Mrs. Gear. Next quarter will commence Monday, March 4th.\" The above is signed by William S. Richards, chairman of trustees, and James Berry, recording secretary. It is also endorsed by John Pratt, principal of the Granville institution, and Paschal Carter, professor of mathematics and natural philosophy, in the same institution. Those who assisted Mr. Sawyer in completing the buildings, were Messrs. Luther Woods, Allen Sinnet, D. M. Shepardson and Alanson Sinnet. The teachers under Mr. Poland were Miss In graham and Miss Isabella R. Clarke, of Massachu setts; the latter becoming superintendent in 1835. Miss Maynard and Miss Trimble were employed the next year, and Messrs. Moore and Converse were also principals one year. Dr. Burton had control of this school one or two years, and Mans field French was principal, following Mr. Burton. About 1840 Rev. Alva Sanford obtained posses sion of the property, and changed the name and influence of the school, he being an Episcopalian. He called it the Episcopal Female seminary, and continued to conduct the school with a consider able degree of success for fifteen years. At the"], [462, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 452 GRANVILLE FEMALE COLLEGE AND CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC."], [463, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 453 end of this period Solomon Sanford assumed con trol of the institution, continuing its priucipal, however, only about a year. Under control of the Sanfords the school flourished, and was a great help to the Episcopal church. In 1856 Rev. C. S. Doolittle and Joseph Lindley became proprietors, and conducted the school about three years, when they concluded to move it to Mansfield, Ohio. This seemed to be at the time an unfortunate move for the school, and especially for the Episcopal church. The buildings were closed for a time. In 1860 Rev. N. S. Buxton and wife opened a ladies' female institute in the basement of the Baptist church, with the thought, probably, of reviving the Baptist seminary which had been re placed by the Episcopal. This school continued about two years, when Rev. M. Stone purchased the seminary buildings, and opened a school, when both schools were consolidated under Mr. Stone, and came again under control of the Baptist de nomination, where it has ever since remained. The name was again changed to the Baptist Female seminary. Mr. Stone gave good satisfaction as an instructor, but circumstances rendered it necessary for him to dispose of the property, which he did to its pres- ent proprietor, Rev. D. Shepardson, D.D., who be came principal in 1867. Dr. Shepardson changed the name of the college to the Granville Female seminary. Denison University. \u2014 This institution was organized at Granville, Ohio, December 13, 1831, as the Granville Literary and Theological insti- tute, and incorporated February 3, 1832. Its first professor and president was the now venerable and highly esteemed John Pratt, D. D., who continued to occupy a position in its faculty until 1859, and novv lives on a farm near the former site of the col- lege, honored by all who know him. The school was at first organized on the man- ual-labor idea, and was located on a farm of some one hundred and thirty-five acres, about one mile southwest of the village \u2014 the farm, valued at three thousand three hundred dollars, having been given by the Baptist church and citizens of Granville as an inducement to locate the school there. In 1837 Rlv. Jonathan Going, D. D., then secretary of the American Baptist Home Mission society, was >9 called to the presidency, and moved to Granville, administering the affairs of the school to the great satisfaction of its friends until 1844, when he died. In r845 the name was changed to Granville col lege, and in 1846 Rev. Silas Bailey, D. D., LL. D., was called to the presidency. At a meeting of the trustees in August, 1833, the institution was organized into four depart ments, viz.: Preparatory, English, collegiate and theological. The \"manual labor system\"' adopted by this college was persevered in for some years. The students were required to be daily occupied with some kind of work, either on the farm or in some mechanical pursuit; the trustees early \"resolved, as soon as practicable, to furnish them with work and the instruments for performing it, and to pay them the value of their labor.\" In addition to Rev. John Pratt, who was then professor of moral philosophy, the first faculty consisted of Pascal Carter, A. M., professor of mathematics and natural philosophy; Asa Drury, A. M., professor of languages, and A. H. Frink, A. M., principal of the preparatory department. In the spring of 1832, the buildings of the in stitution were destroyed by fire, which caused some embarrassment, but new and more commo dious buildings were promptly erected during the ensuing summer. In the Baptist Weekly Journal of November 29, 1 83 1, published in New York city, Dr. Jonathan Going writes as follows regarding this institution: \"With such a corps of teachers as President Pratt, professors Carter, Drury and Frink (I speak from personal acquaintance with these gentlemen, except the last named), with a hundred pupils, including already a dozen regular college students; in a location so delightful and healthy, in the heart of the great and growing State of Ohio, where expenses are so small, and with arrangements for manual labor in agriculture and various branches of mechanic arts, which will at once diminish these, and promote health of body and mental vigor, it requires no spirit of prophecy to predict the future prosperity of the insti tution. I am persuaded, indeed, that it presents even now facilities for acquiring a thorough education inferior to none in the western valley, while it promises in future to hold respecta ble rank among similar institutions, which happily are rising into importance at different points.\" During its early history the college was greatly- straitened in its finances, and for years passed through the trials and vicissitudes incident to young institutions in those times. In 1852 Dr."], [464, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 454 DENISON UNIVERSITY. Bailey resigned, and in 1853 Rev. Jeremiah Hall, D. D., was elected to the position. In 1855, the location of the college was changed to the present elevated and beautiful site just north of the village, and its friends rallied and erected a new building which is four stories high, one hun dred and thirty-three feet by eighty-three feet deep in the middle, with wings forty-five feet deep. It contains,, besides recitation rooms and society halls, thirty-three suites of rooms (sitting room, bedroom, and two closets), and accommodates sixty-six stu dents. In the following year (1856-7) a frame building, three stories in height, was erected. The present grounds contain twenty-four acres, nearly half of it being a grove of old forest trees. From this time the school entered upon a new career of prosperity. The Baptists of Ohio began to rally around it, students came to it, and it was enabled to take an important place among the edu-"], [465, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 455 cational institutions of the State. In 1853 the entire assets of the college, including all endowments, amounted to only thirteen thousand seven hundred and seventy-two dollars and sixty-five cents; but in 1856 William S. Denison, of Adamsville, gave ten thousand dollars toward the endowment, and in his honor the name was changed to Denison univer sity. In 1863 Dr. Hall resigned, and Rev. Samson Talbot, D. D., was elected to the presidency, and continued to discharge the duties of the office, to the great satisfaction of the trustees and patrons, until his sudden and lamented death in 1873. In 1869-70, the second building (that on the right hand in the cut) was erected, still larger in dimen- sions than the former. It contains a chapel, nat- ural history room, and accommodations for seventy- two students. In 1863 the Baptist convention of Ohio undertook to raise an endowment of one hundred thousand dollars, which was completed in 1867, and the full amount has thus far been pre- served intact, an income of six per cent, on the amount being available, annually, for the payment of salaries of professors. In 1872-3 another fund of seventy-five thousand dollars was raised and is held in like manner. These funds are largely due to the intelligent munificence of E. E. Barney, E. Thresher, and W. P. Huffman, of Dayton, J. M. Hoyt, of Cleveland, and other noble brethren scattered throughout the State. In 1875 Rev. E. Benjamin Andrews, A. M., was elected president, and continued in the office until 1879, when he resigned, and Rev. Alfred Owen, D. D.j was elected to succeed him. In 1877 W. H. Doane, musical doctor, of Cin- cinnati, donated to the college the sum of ten thousand dollars, for the purpose of erecting a building for the library and cabinet. This building was dedicated at the commencement in 1878. It is substantial and beautiful; and is believed to be as well adapted to its purpose as any such building in the country. It is called \"Doane Hall.\" There is on the premises (unrepresented on the cut, hidden by Doane Hall), a wooden building oiiginally erected on the farm above referred to, but removed to the present site and now appropri- ated to a gymnasium and armory for the use of ' the students. The present value of the buildings and grounds is about seventy-five thousand dollars, and the endowment at the present time, with no debt, about one hundred and seventy-five thou sand dollars, making the total value of the proper ty two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, besides the library and apparatus. The university library contains ten thousand volumes, and with the two society libraries makes the whole number of volumes available to the stu dents at least founteen thousand. The university library, in Doane hall, is open in term time, daily, except Sundays, for the use of the members of the college classes. The college reading room, open every forenoon and evening, is supplied with the choicest daily and weekly papers, and with the best English and American magazines and reviews. The cabinet contains a choice selection of shells, and a full series of specimens for illustrations in geology, mineralogy, Zoology, and arch\u00e6ology. During term time it is open daily, except Sundays, to students and visitors. Students have the use of the university library, as well as the cabinet, free of charge. Both library and cabinet are re ceiving constant accessions. There are two college literary societies \u2014 the Calliopean, founded in 1834, and the Franklin, founded in 1S43. They publish a bi-monthly pa per, the Denison Collegian, devoted to literary themes and college and town news. There is a literary society connected w-ith the preparatory de partment \u2014 the Ciceronian. The society of Alumni was organized in 1859, and the Reading Room and Lecture association in 1873. The aim of instruction has been, from the first, to secure the greatest accuracy and thoroughness. The graduates of the university have taken rank with any others in the professional schools where their studies have been continued, and in society. The charter, amended in 1867, vests the man agement of the university in a board of thirty-six trustees, to be chosen exclusively from members in good standing and full fellowship in regular Baptist churches of Ohio, who shall hold their office only so long as they retain such membership and con tinue to reside in the State \u2014 five, at least, to be resident freeholders of Licking county. These are divided into classes of twelve each, the term"], [466, "4S6 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. of office being three years.

These men are generally faithful to their trust, and give their best thought and most earnest at tention to the affairs of the college. Twenty-one of them were present at the last meeting, and their deliberations were marked by great unanimity of thought and purpose. The faculty is composed of men most of them long tried and found to be thoroughly prepared for and interested in their work. Dr. Owen, the president, has won the high regard of his col leagues and the entire confidence of the board, as well as the respect and esteem of students and citizens. There is to be no change in the corps of instructors for the coming year. The faculty consists of the following able men : Rev. Alfred Owen, D. D., president; Maria Theresa Barney, professor of intellectual and moral philosophy; Almon U. Thresher, A. M., professor of rhetoric and English literature; Lewis E. Hicks, A.

The next anniversary closes fifty years of edu cational work at Granville \u2014 a fact of no mean im portance. Few institutions in the land can point to a fairer record. It is doubtful if more has been done, with equal resources, anywhere on the conti nent. The college has had, from the first, a well earned reputation for careful training and thorough scholarship, which it hopes to maintain in all time to come. This semi-centennial will be appropriately ob served. A committee oi the trustees is appointed, and the co-operation of alumni and students is specially invited, that the end of fifty years may result in such awakened enthusiasm and hope as will bear the work forward both in attempting and accomplishing greater things in the future. The following extract from the report of the committee appointed in 1878, to examine the finan cial condition of the college, will be found inter esting in this connection: \"The committee appointed to prepare a statement as to the history and condition of the funds of the university, present the following. In submitting their report, the committee offer as prefatory, and as being necessary to its completeness, the substance of a paper prepared by Dr. Talbot in r863, which presents an exhaustive and complete exhibition of the finances of the college from its origin to the date of that paper. This exhibit divides those thirty-two years into two periods; The first extending from the origin of the college in 1831 to 1853; the second from 1853 to 1863. \"It was ascertained that the entire assets of the college in 1853, including all endowments, were only thirteen thousand seven hundred and seventy-two dollars and sixty-five cents. At the end of the second period in 1863 the entire endowments of the college were estimated at fifty thousand dollars. Dr. Tal bot was appointed president of the college at the June meeting of the trustees in that year. The college was at that time in a. very precarious condition. The country being in the midst of"], [467, "HISTORY FO LICKING COUNTY. 457 our late civil war, was depressed in all its interests almost to despair. The faculty were without any visible means of sup port, except the tuition fees of the scanty number of students, and that number was constantly decreasing by enlistment in the volunteer armies of the Government. In this state of affairs the trustees resolved to petition the Baptist convention of the State of Ohio, to recommend to the friends of the college to raise some endowment for the support of its faculty. This petition was presented to the convention at its annual meeting in October, 1863, and the convention resolved to recommend the raising of a special endowment of one hundred thousand dollars. This undertaking was assumed by a few individuals in manner as set forth in the following plan: ' \"The undersigned residents in the State of Ohio propose to raise the full sum of one hundred thousand dollars, to be held as a permanent fund, the annual income of which only may be expended in sustaining the faculty of instruction in Denison university, at Granville, Ohio. '\"To secure this object, we, the undersigned, agree to pay the several sums set opposite our respective names to William P. Huffman, of Dayton, Hubbard Colby, of Mansfield, and George F. Davis, of Cincinnati, or either of them, to be held by them in trust, and invested in such form as they may deem best, until with the accrued interest, the entire sum of one hundred thousand dollars shall have been secured, when they shall call a meeting of the centributors at Granville, Ohio, by sending a written notice to each, and publishing it at least two weeks in the Journal and Messenger, or the denominational paper, to determine whether the money shall be paid over to the trustees of Denison university, or to a separate board of trustees of endowment fund, to be then incorporated under the act passed March 12, 1853. At this meeting a majority of the persons present, representing in person or by proxy the sums contrib- uted, shall be a quorum to transact business, each one hundred dollars contributed entitling the person representing it to one vote, and a majority of the votes determining to which body the funds shall be entrusted. In no event, however, shall any part of the principal be used, but the annual income only shall be appropriated as aforesaid.' \"This endowment was consummated in 1867. At a meeting of the subscribers to this fund held in Granville, June 27, 1867, it was ascertained that the full amount of reliable subscription somewhat exceeded one hundred thousand dollars, and it was resolved to pay over to the trustees of Denison university the full amount of this subscription in trust, for the object for which the funds were given with the specifications and restrictions attached thereto. This trust was accepted by the college at a meeting of its trustees, held in Granville on the same day, as above specified, and is known on our records as the hundred thousand dollars fund. \"Thus it will be seen thatjthe university holds in trust a spe cial fund of one hundred thousand dollars, limited in its appli cation to the support of the faculty, the annual income of which only can be expended. In 1872 and 1873, seventy-five thousand dollars were raised, known as the twenty-five thousand dollar subscription and the fifty thousand dollar subscription. These distinctions were caused by a proposition, in 1872, by Mr. E. E. Barney, a trustee, to give ten thousand dollars upon condition that the full sum of twenty-five thousand dollars could be raised, and by a proposal of the same, in 1873, t0 g've twenty-five thousand dollars, provided the full sum of fifty usand dollars could be raised. These conditions were ful- filled, and the sum of seventy-five thousand dollars was raised. These funds were given lo meet the current wants of the uni versity, without limitation, except that no part of the principal should ever be used, nor any more than six per cent, of the in come in any one year. The fifty thousand dollar subscription was accepted by the trustees under very heavy penalties of for feiture, provided any part of the principal or any more than six per cent, of the income should ever be used, or any part of the principal or more than six per cent, of the income of any other funds belonging to the university, then known to the sub scribers. \" In addition to the foregoing, the university has interest bearing securities amounting to sixteen thousand seven hundred and seventy-five dollars. This amount is made up of the fol lowing items: The presidential and theological fund $12,000 A memorial fund, given by Mr. M. E. Gray, a trustee, in 1876, as a token of respect to his deceased father, Andrew Gray 500 The centennial endowment fund, consisting of one thousand dollars, given by Mr. J. B. Trevor, of New York, and sundry small sums, called \"thedollar roll,\" collected in 1876 by Rev. T. J. Sheppard, amounting in all to 2,275 And two thousand dollars presented by Mr. J. D. Rock- efeller, a trustee, one thousand dollars at the annual meeting of trustees in June, 1878, and one thousand dollars at a special meeting held October 24th, of the same year 2,000 $16,775 \"The committee recommend that the above small sums, amounting to sixteen thousand seven hundred and seventy-five dollars, all of which are now applicable, in their annual income, to the current expenses of the university, be added, for the sake of convenience in keeping accounts, to the seventy-five thousand dollar fund; and that this sum, when both funds are united, be known as the consolidated endowment fund, amount ing to ninety-one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five dollars; and that the expenditure of interest from this fund and the one hundred thousand dollar fund, agreeably to sundry obligations assumed by the trustees, as before stated, be re stricted to a sum not exceeding six per cent, annually. \" In addition to the above, there have been added to the en dowment of the university, since 1863, the new brick edifice, estimated at a cost of thirty-five thousand dollars, in which is a commodious chapel, completed in the fall of 1871; the library building, estimated at a cost of ten thousand dollars, presented to the university by Mr. W. H. Doane, a trustee; and sundry additions made to the library, philosophical apparatus, etc., estimated at a cost of ten thousand dollars. \"The entire endowments of the university then stand thus: Estimated endowment in 1863 $ 50,000 One hundred thousand dollar endowment 100,000 Consolidated endowment fund 91, 77$ New building 35\u00bbooo Library building 10,000 Additions to library, etc 10,000 $296,775 \"Besides the above, the university holds in trust three thous and two hundred dollars given for the benefit of Mrs. Mary E. scribers. lowing items: $16,775 $296,775"], [468, "458 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. college. Students are made welcome in the various Sunday schools of the village. In the Baptist Sunday-school, several classes, taught by college instructors, are intended expressly for students. \"It is the desire of the trustees and faculty, to conserve, and as far as possible, advance, the honorable reputation already ac corded to this college, for thoroughness, and other excellencies of mental discipline. The aim is to build, fashion, and develop young men, in the most earnest and successful manner possible, intellectually and morally, for the higher vocations and duties of life. Every possible resource and effort is, and will be, em ployed in furtherance of this end. \"Many considerations particularly recommend Denison uni versity as a place for acquiring liberal learning. Its courses of study are thorough and comprehensive; students in it are pecu liarly free from incentives to dissipation ; they are constantly subject to a strong Christian influence; the location of the uni versity is beautiful and salubrious; means of living are obtaina ble at a low price, and the intellectual life of the college com munity is quickened by the presence of other schools.\" Talbot, widow of the late president, Samson Talbot, the annual income of which is to be paid to her quarterly for fifteen years from the date of the first payment to Mrs. Talbot, or, in the event of her marriage or death, for the benefit of her children, until the youngest is eighteen years of age, when said fund be comes the property of the university, and its annual income becomes applicable to its ordinary annual expenditures.

Its physical aspects are also deeply in teresting; containing, as it does, some of the grand est scenery in this part of the State. Few evidences of the Mound Builders yet re main within its limits, enough, however, to prove beyond doubt that its soil was pressed by the soot of this mysterious people. Centuries ago human beings, or beings in human form, perhaps, swarm-"], [469, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 459 ing river. It has been plowed over for years and greatly lowered and worn away, but is yet about eight feet high and thirty feet in diameter at the base. It was opened last winter by some curiosity hunters, and a quantity of human bones, in a more or less decayed condition, exhumed, but nothing was found of particular importance.- There is also a small mound on the farm of P. R. Den man, in the north part of the township, about ten rods west of his house. It is a little larger around than the other, being, perhaps, forty feet in diame ter at the base, but is only about five feet in height. No Indian history of consequence is connected with the township. No permanent camps of these red sons of the forest had an existence here in his toric times, though it was used by the Bowling Green Indians as a hunting ground. The northern and southern portions of the town ship incline toward its center, through which passes the main Licking river. The scenery along this stream is magnificent, but as it has been particular ly referred to in another chapter will not receive attention here. The main tributary of this stream is the Rocky fork, which enters the township near the northwest corner, and passing a little east of south, enters the Licking river a mile or more from the west line of 'the township Two or three smaller streams cross the northern part of the township, running south into the Licking. From the south the main stream is the Brushy fork, which, in an early day, was lined with underbrush and obstructed by drift wood \u2014 hence the name. The land along the Licking bottom is of the same quality as that of Madison, and needs no descrip tion. There is, however, less of it than in Madison. In the latter township there is a broad expanse of beautiful, level bottom land, the hills receding some distance from the stream. In this township they hug the river more closely, until at \"Black Hand\" the massive rocks shake hands, as it were, over the dark abyss through which the river finds an outlet. Much of the township is therefore hill or upland, and well adapted to grazing and the raising of wheat and other small grains. The Pittsburgh, Cincinnati & St. Louis and the Central Ohio railroads, and the Ohio canal, pass across the township from east to west, the two latter following the valley of the Licking, and the former entering the township at the northeast corner and traversing it in a southwesterly direction, enters the Licking valley in Madison township. The Licking river was first used for transportation, and many a canoe and skiff, loaded with pioneers, their families and effects, and many others with the product of the woods, passed up and down this stream in pio neer days. After 1830 the canal-boat took the place of the skiff and pirogue, and soon after 1850 the railroad, that wonderful human civilizing ma chine, came to crown all other means of transpor tation. Christopher Gist was the first white man known to history, to press the soil of Hanover township. This was one hundred and twenty-nine years ago. His story is told in another chapter of this work. Chaplain Jones passed through the valley in r 772, and was the second. He was accompanied by a trader named David Duncan. William Dragoo was probably the third white man to pass up this valley. This was in 1786. The father of the late Benjamin Elliott was the fourth, about 1790, and Captain Samuel Brady the fifth, about 1792 or 1793. Captain Brady, how ever, had with him a party of scouts. This com prises the list of white men who entered this valley, as far as known, until the coming of Messrs. Hughes and Ratliff, the first white settlers of the county. Philip Barrack was, probably, the first perma nent settler of this township. He was a native of Maryland, and early determined to make his home in Ohio. Accordingly, with his trusty rifle on his shoulder, his wife mounted on a two year old filly, and a few articles of clothing bound to the back of a two year old heifer, he started for Marietta, and after a tedious journey of some weeks, reached that place. Not liking the locality, he ascended the Muskingum river in a canoe, and finally the Licking river. This was in 1798. He squatted near where the Claypool mills now are until the spring of 1801 (some -accounts say 1802), when he removed six or eight miles further up the valley, settling near the Licking narrows. He was a man of energy, industry, enterprise, influence, conduct ing successfully his farm, together with a tavern and a distillery. His daughter, Millie, was pro bably the first white child born \"on the waters of"], [470, "460 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. the Licking.\" His first cabin, or dwelling, in this township was built near the spacious brick he afterward erected, and consisted of merely a pen of round logs, with but three sides, the fourth being left open for the fire, something after the style of a sugar-camp house. He was a man of considerable tact, and fertile in those expedients, by which he was enabled to conduct his business without the aid of those tools which made indus trial pursuits comparatively easy at a later day. Much is yet told of his leatherwood traces, willow bark gears, husk collars, etc. In 1803, Jesse James and Jesse Haines squatted on the Thompson section. The former put up his cabin a short distance south of Barrick's house, and the latter squatted near Stump's saw-mill. In 1804, John Stateler began to clear land on Wood bridge's bottom, near the \"ore landing.\" Matthias' Denman came in the same year, and erected a cabin on the Woodbridge land. He was from New Jersey. The Denmans were powerful men and delighted in feats of strength. It is related of Philip and Hathaway Denman, sons of Matthias, that in a mauling frolic with John Stateler, they split two hundred rails in the morning before breakfast. At another time Philip Denman cut the timber and split five hundred rails by two o'clock p. m., on the Camp farm, and at another time his two brothers made sour hundred rails in six hours. Two hundred rails were considered a day's work for two men. Daniel Thompson, the largest land proprietor in the township, came in 1804. He owned four thousand acres, and built his cabin near the road leading from Boston to Toboso. He seems to have been unfitted for a frontiersman; his large estate was soon frittered away in small tracts, for labor, stock, or anything which suited his fancy, .and he soon left the county. Rufus Enyart came soon after Thompson. He was the latter's son-in-law, settled on four hundred acres of land given him by Thompson, and erected a hewed log house, since occupied by his son, Daniel Enyart. In 1806 Chester Wells and John Hollister came. They pitched a tent on the Rocky fork, a few rods north of Martin's house, in which they lived until they cleared a \"truck\" patch and planted corn and potatoes. They then built a cabin with two rooms and a space between. Shortly afterward Captain Elisha Wells came and moved into the same house with Wells and Hollister, and the three conjointly erected, in 1808, a grist-mill where its successor is still running. The)>with others of the same family, became own ers of a section, or quarter township. Chester Wells had the east side of the section, and erected a frame house, and, a few years later, the brick house since occupied by Mr. Stump. Captain Wells owned the west side of the section, and John Hollister the middle. The latter erected a frame house on his part, since occupied by Captain Coman. These were energetic, public spirited men, who did much to advance the interests of the township. From 1806 to 1809 there was a large addition of immigrants. Among them were Daniel Shadley, Samuel Varner, George Learson, Michael Stateler, Peter Barrick, John Ratliff, James Johnson, and Zachariah Carlisle. The township was organized April 19, 1808, beina; the third organized in the county. It em braced all the territory east of Newark township. Records of the early doings in the township are lost. Among the early justices of the peace, how ever, was Zachariah Carlisle. His administration of justice was somewhat unique. He was alto gether untrammeled by verbose forms and legal learning. His own ideas of right and wrong gov erned him in deciding a case, and this often in volved him in difficulties with litigants. He rarely stopped to write subpcenas, but gave his order, ver bally, to George Learson, the constable, who could neither read nor write, to \" bring the defendant forthwith.\" Religion received early attention in this town ship. Joseph Thrap w-as the first, and, for a long time, the only preacher. He was a Methodist, and a zealous, earnest man, and much esteemed by all who knew him. James B. Finley was the first circuit preacher, and was \"a dreadful noisy man.\" At present there are six churches in the township \u2014 four Methodist (two being Protestant Method ists), one Presbyterian, and one Disciple. Rev. Joseph Thrap held the first religious ser vices in the Licking valley, and was one of the"], [471, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 461 most prominent of the early ministers. A short sketch of his life may he interesting in this con nection. He was born in Baltimore county, Maryland, in October, 1776. His parents had been members of the Church of England, but, under the ministry of Robert Strawbridge, embraced the Methodist reli gion. Joseph, in 1796, served six months in the Virginia militia under Captain Dent, and received for this service a land warrant for one hundred and sixty acres. In 1799 he embraced religion, attach ing himself to the Methodist Episcopal church. In 1803 he married Jemima, daughter of Isaac Van Camp, a pioneer, who occupied five hundred acres of land near Morgantown by virtue of a tomahawk right. Father Thrap was six feet in height; had an erect, firm, compact frame, and elastic step. He was always very patriotic, but was too old to bear arms in the Union cause in the great Rebellion, but encouraged thirteen of his grandsons to go. They were in many of the hardest fought battles of the war, and all came back but one, who starved to death in Andersonville. In the Spring of 1805, his father, with several other sons and daughters with families, settled on the Licking, and were soon organized into a Meth odist society; and in April, 1806, the first quarter ly meeting ever held in this region of the country was held in his cabin, which stood in the eastern edge of Licking, where the residence of Owen Dorsey now stands. He was there licensed to preach, and, finally, graduated to elders' orders. In 1829, when the Protestant Methodist church was being oganized, he attached himself to that body, and remained an acceptable member until his death. As a preacher he was up to the me dium standard, but in prayer he was often eloquent in speech, and overwhelming in power. He died at his residence near Irville, May r2, 1866, at the ripe age of nearly ninety years. The pioneers of this township, as well as of all other parts of the county, represented almost every phase of religious belief, and were generally deeply imbued with a religious spirit. There were repre sentatives of nearly every religious denomination, but they were chiefly Methodists, Presbyterians and Episcopalians. Preachers of the various religious creeds frequently passed through the valley, and held services in the cabins of the settlers. The earliest Methodist meetings were mainly held at Zachariah Carlisle's cabin, and a little later at the cabin of Joseph Thrap. The first Presbyterian sermon preached in the township was by a colored man, the services being held at the cabin of Chester Wells. At a later date the Rev. Mr. Rose, of Newark, frequently preached. Early Episco pal services were frequently held at the house of John Hollister, and were generally conducted by Messrs. Rose and Putnam, or other reprentatives of Gambier college. No one denomination, how ever, felt able, or were strong enough in numbers, to erect a church, yet all felt the need of a build ing in which to hold religious services. This ne cessity finally culminated in the erection, about 1815, of a union church, which should be free to all denominations. It was a brick building, and stood on land now owned by Leonard Stump, in the northern central part of the township. The Pittsburgh, Cincinnati & St. Louis railroad now passes near where the church stood. It was in use about thirty years, or more. At some period of its existence it passed into the hands of the Protestant Methodist society. This society, about 1860, or before, erected a new church near the site of the old one, where they continue to hold services. John F. Williams, Samuel Somerville (deceased), and Horace Fairbanks were prominent early members in this Protestant Methodist church. The present membership is, probably, twenty-five or thirty, and an active Sunday-school is main tained. The Protestant Methodists were very strong in the Licking valley in an early day, and organized several churches in different parts of the valley ; and probably the old Protestant Methodist church down on Brushy fork, in the southern part of the township, was among the earliest. It was estab lished by Joseph Thrap, and he and the Rev. C Springer were the earliest preachers here. Among the early members Messrs. Phillips and Skinner were prominent, and were leaders in the organiza tion. The church \u2014 a hewed log \u2014 was erected near the main fork of Brushy fork, about 1829 or 1830, and was used until 1852, when the present building was erected. The church building, proba-"], [472, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 462 \"Their church edifice is a substantial stone structure, and was erected in 1838. It is situated about two and a half miles southeast of Clay Lick station, on the Central Ohio rail road, on the road across the Flint ridge to Zanesville, some times called the Mount Sterling road. The whole number of members enrolled from the commencement to the present time, (about 1870,) is about three hundred. Many of the original members have died, and many others removed west, leaving the present number about seventy-five or eighty.\" There are three villages within the limits of this township \u2014 Boston (not the Hub) Hanover and Toboso. The first named, and of the least in size and importance, was first started. It was about 1832 that John Hoyt put up a little shanty, and opened a grocery. He did a thriving business, and soon other buildings were erected, and the place promised to become an important point; but the railroads changed the course of trade, and the little village may now safely say, \"Non sum gualis eratn.\" Three years later, Mr. Hoyt started a grocery on the flat, on Rocky fork near the grist-mill, and thus became the founder of the village of Han over. This was in 1835, but no town was laid out until 1849. William Wells, of Glastonbury, Connecticut, was the original owner of the quarter township upon which Hanover is situated. He divided this land (four thousand acres) among his relatives, among whom were Chester Wells and John Hollister; the latter received twelve hundred acres, and upon it laid out the town November 26 and 27, 1849. It was first called \"Fleming\" after John M. Flem ing, who had become part owner of the land, but was changed to Hanover after the post office was established, that being the name of the office. David Wyrick was the surveyor of the town plat, and laid it out on the east side of Rocky fork; it now extends to the west side of that stream. Chester Wells was the first postmaster, and kept the office in Hollister's mill. George Hollister was the second postmaster, and has retained the office continuously until the present time. He now keeps a store in the village, and the old mill is yet in successful operation, having ground the staff of life for seventy-two years for the people of that part of the county. A saw-mill has always been attached to it. John Hoyt's grocery was in exist ence many years before the town was laid out, but bly, did not cost over four or five hundred dollars, being built mostly by voluntary labor. The pres ent membership is forty-five; services are held every two weeks, and an active Sunday-school is maintained during the summer. The following regarding the attempt to establish an Episcopal church in Hanover is from an his torical sermon by Rev. William Bower, delivered at Trinity church, Newark, January 20, 1869: \"The places in the county at which the Episcopal church has held her ministrations, giving them in the reverse order of their importance, are Hanover, Utica, Granville and Newark. There has been occasional preaching by our ministers in other places, but not the organization of any church. In these four places parishes were organized, and reports concerning them are pre served in our church records. \"The parish at Hanover was organized about the year 1830, by some missionary from Gambier, whose name I have been unable to ascertain. Messrs. Rose and Putnam, as above stated.] It was very weak from the first, and very short lived. It depended for existence mainly upon the inter est and support of the family of Mr. John Hollister, at whose house the services were usually held. After the Newark church was built, Mr. Hollister and family, in 1837, became members of that parish, and services at Hanover ceased. As far as I can learn the only two ministers who went with any regularity to Hanover (in addition to Drs. Sparrow, Wing, and others from Gambier, ) were the Rev. R. T. Rogers and Rev. G. Deni son; Mr. Rogers only for two months, Mr. Denison nearly two years. One short item from Mr. Denison respecting Hanover at that time, and I will pass on to another parish. From this item, those who are interested in temperance reform will be able to see, as far as that portion of Licking county is concerned, whether, respecting the use of liquor, we are going backwards or forwards. Mr. Denison writes of Hanover in the year 1830: 'Distillation of ardent spirits, once carried on exten sively, is entirely stopped in this township, and one of the church officers said to me, I do not know of a single individual within a circuit of two miles, who has used a drop this harvest. Some of us, however, will suspect that while the church officer who volunteered this information, knew a great deal, there were some things going on among his neighbors of which he was ig norant. If not, it surely was a model township. Jacob Winter, esq., gives the following brief his tory of the \"Brushy Fork congregation,\" or Disci ple church, located on Brushy fork, in the southern part of this township: \"The first preaching here was by Jesse B. Ferguson about 1837, and afterwards by William Hathaway, Albert Law, Ziba Brown, Dr. William Hayes, J. H. Jones, Asbury Gardner and William Atherton. This congregation was organized in the latter part of 1837, with Artemas Baker, his wife, one son and two daughters, Robert Wills and wife, John Oatman and wife, Jacob Palmer and wife, John Palmer and son, Ezekiel Skinner and wife, William Coomes and wife, and John Perry and wife, as first members. Artemas Baker, Jacob Palmer and John Perry, were its first elders."], [473, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 463 after that, Messrs. Francis H. and Christopher Woodbridge who kept store in Newark, and were nephews of Mr. Hollister, established a branch store here. John Hoyt erected and conducted the first hotel in the place. There are, at present, two stores in the place, beside that of Mr. Hollister, kept by E. P. Stone and C P. Arnold; a foundry conducted by Mr. Hollister, where stoves are cast, and general repairing done ; two wagon and carri- age shops, two hotels, a basket factory, about sixty- five dwellings, three hundred inhabitants, two churches, a town hall and a large brick unionschool building. In this latter bnilding, which cost about six thousand dollars, three teachers are employed, and about one hundred pupils are in attendance. The churches of the village are the Methodist Episcopal and Presbyterian. The first is an off- shoot from the old church established by Joseph Thrap, the early meetings of which were held at Zachariah Carlisle's cabin about two and a half miles east of Hanover. Part of this congregation living in and near the town, built this church about 1852. It is a comfortable frame building, worth about two thousand five hundred dollars. The membership is thirty-five. A union Sunday-school has been maintained nearly ever since the town was laid out; but in the fall of 1872 this church established one of its own, which has been well sustained, the membership be- ing at present about sixty. In the fall of 1867, Rev. Daniel Tenny, pastor of the Second Presbyterian church of Newark, began preaching in the Methodist Episcopal church, of Hanover, once in two weeks, upon the invitation of Messrs. L. P. Coman, George Hol- lister, W. D. Evans, O. Z. Hillery, G. J. Hagerty, A. F. Hall, N. C Fleming, John F. Williams, Henrv Montgomery, P. R. Denman, and others. Levi P. Coman, Martha A. Coman, Martha Sey- mour, and W. S. Coman, were the only members of the Presbyterian church who were living here at the time of the first communion service in 1869. At this time the following persons united with the church: Charles C and Ruth R. Hayes, from the Methodist Episcopal church ,of Granville; Darwin C. Wilhelm, from the Presby terian church, at Duncan's Falls; Elizabeth Wil helm, from the Congregational church of Gran- ville. February 20, 187 1, a series of meetings were commenced, at which the following persons joined this church: George Hollister, Amanda Hollister, Laura Hollister, George G. Warman, Catharine Hagerty, Catharine Fleming, Charles W. Coman, Susan E. Coman, and Sarah E. Wood. The first prayer meeting was held at George Hollister's house, and was continued at various places until about June rst, when permis- sion was granted to occupy the town hall. In March, 187 1, Mr. Tenny resigned his pastor- ate in Newark, which necessitated his bidding adieu to the congregation here. He had preached every alternate Sabbath in the afternoon. During a portion of 187 1 meetings were held in the town hall while the Methodist Episcopal church was undergoing repairs; it was also during this year that the Methodists refused the further use of their church to the Presbyterians. Steps were immedi- ately taken to erect a new church, and a meeting of the citizens, to take the matter into consider- ation, was called November 6, 1871, at the town hall. One thousand dollars were subscribed at this meeting, and a committee appointed consisted of G. J. Hagerty, J. Coon, D. T. Enyart, G. Hollis- ter, and L. P. Coman, to solicit subscriptions. This committee reported December 4, 187 1, that two thousand and ten dollars had been subscribed, five hundred and ten dollars of which were received in Newark. The church was organized December 30, 1 87 1, with thirty-five members. Of the first elders, L. P. Coman was elected for three years, AJlen T. Hall two years, and George Hollister one year. A. T. Hall and George Hollister were regu- larly ordained by Rev. Howard Kingsbury, of Newark. Mr. Coman had been ordained, having served as elder in the Second Presbyterian church of Newark. The first communion service was held July 14, 1872. The church is a fine brick edifice, erected in 1872, and was paid for in cash upon completion, costing four thousand seven hun- dred dollars. A union Sabbath school was organized March 1, 1868, which is still continued, and is in a flourish- ing condition. The third town laid out in the township was Toboso. William Stanberry owned some land there, and when the Central Ohio railroad was"], [474, "464 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. completed he thought this and the Ohio canal might together make a town on his land at the lower end of the \"Narrows;\" it was accordingly laid out on the south side of the Licking in 1852. Mr. Crumel Fairbanks built the first house and started a grocery and saloon. After the comple tion of the railroad a post office was established and E. Hickey was the first postmaster. Mr. Hickey now keeps store there, and J. V. Levings ton a grocery. There is a warehouse kept by Mr. Oden, and about a dozen dwellings. The Methodists organized a class here and erected the present church edifice soon after the town was laid out. Rev. J. Hooper was influ ential in the early stages of this church organiza tion, and preached for the Methodists in this vicin ity before the church was built, holding services usually at the house of John Hahn. -Mr. John Hahn was one of the first members, as were also Jonathan Simpson and John Simpson. The membership is, at present, forty or fifty. A flour- ishing Sunday-school is in operation, having been organized about the date of the church organization. The location of the village is not considered a ! healthy one, which fact has, perhaps, somewhat re- tarded its growth. Mr. B. C. Woodward, who furnishes much of the history of this township, thus writes regarding pioneer times in this township: \"Dirt floors were universal. The chimneys were seldom j built higher than the jambs, but the fireplaces were large enough to contain a great deal of wood. Around the fires made in them the sons of labor gathered and enjoyed them- selves with as keen a relish as though their homes were palatial. It was in 1807 that puncheons were first used for floors, and in the same year Daniel Ward split a black-walnut tree and made the first table used 'on the waters of the Licking.'\" CHAPTER LIV.

B. Clark on the Abolition Riots and Things in General. HARTFORD township is in the northwestern corner of the county, and is known in the or iginal survey as township four in the fifteenth range of townships in the United States military lands. It lies near the head-waters of all the principal streams forming Licking river, and has been ascer tained by actual survey to occupy the most elevated position of any land between Cleveland and Colum bus. The Otter fork of the Licking heads about two miles from the north line of the township, passing diagonally through, and leaving it about the center of the east side. This is the main stream in the township. Generally there is no marked difference between the quality of the soil along this stream and that of the land more remote. The native forest consisted of sugar, beech, white and black ash, white and black oak, hickory, black and white walnut, wild cherry, hackberry, and elm. The un dergrowth was water beech, dogwood, and an abundance of spice bush, which has become en tirely extinct. The face of the country is gently rolling. About a mile and a half northwest of the village of Hartford, an elevation of land, covering some thirty or forty acres, may have a claim to a hill. The land is rich, and renders no obstruction to cultivation; at least three-fourths of it may be considered equal in fertility to any in the county, perhaps in the State. There is little or no waste land by swamps. Surface stone are very scarce; and a stone quarry is unknown within the township limits. It is well adapted to pasturage, and has a lopal notoriety for its wool product. A little bog ore is all the mineral the township can boast of. Very few of the Mound Builders' works, if they were ever numerous, have survived the ravages of"], [475, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 465 time. About the center of the northeast quarter of the township, on the land of Mr. C. L. Graves, is a slight elevation, which encircles about ten acres. There is little or no Indian history connected with the township; but evidences of their occupa tion are not wanting. Numerous flint arrow points, stone hatchets, and other relics are found. The west half of the township was originally school land. The east half was entered under an old law, requiring a whole military section of four thousand acres to be entered in a body. The south east quarter was entered by Jonathan and Elias B. Dayton; the northeast quarter by Dr. Jonas Stan berry, who sold it to the Granville company. Their land in this township was surveyed into one hun dred acre lots by James Coe, and they ratified this survey in all their deeds. Daniel Poppleton was the first settler in the town ship. He came in April, T812, and was soon fol lowed by C. L. Graves, Strong Clark, Daniel Wright, Enoch Whipple, Clark Cooley, Ezekiel Wells and Adam Kite, all of whom settled on the northeast quarter, and by Mr. Shaw, and Titus S. Hopkins, who settled on the school land. Although Daniel Poppleton was the pioneer set tler of Hartford, there were several small improve ments made before he came, by Roswell Graves, Ezekiel Wells and Lester Case, neither of whom, however, then settled their families here. Rumors of a contemplated Indian raid, toward the close of 1812, induced Mr. Poppleton to. leave the township for a few months for protection. C. L, Graves and Clark Cooley, before mentioned, were emigrants of 1813. When Monroe township was organized it included Liberty, Bennington and Hartford townships. Under this organization Esquire Moses Foster was the first justice of the peace, and C. L. Graves first constable. About 1816 Bennington and Hartford townships were set off under the name of Bennington. Under this organization Michael Trout and Daniel Pop pleton were elected justices of the peace, Elisha Harris constable on the Hartford side, and Strong Clark township clerk. In September, 1819, Hart ford was erected into a separate township. Strong Clark did the business and named the township. Previous to this the school land was being rapidly settled under fictitious temporary leases. It is worthy of record that during all the arrangements for securing legal claims to these lands, in no in stance was an attempt made to supplant or derange die affairs of actual settlers. The first election in the township was held in a log school-house on the town-plat in September, 1819. The number of votes cast was forty-eight. Elijah Durfey was elected justice of the peace; Daniel I. Durfey, township clerk; and Leonard Bushnel, treasurer. The first frame building in the township was John Mclnturf's saw-mill, on Otter fork, erected in 181 7. The first frame house was that of Elijah Durfey, erected on the site of the village of Hart ford in 1 818. The first frame barn was that of Asa Cooley, on the farm afterward owned by Dan iel Warner, in 1819. The first building raised without whiskey was Ezekiel Scovell's barn, in 1830. The first marriage was that of Enoch Whipple to Kate Shaw, in 1815; the first child born was Michel Cooley, June 3, 1813; the first official act of R. Everett, a justice of the peace, was to marry Miss Cooley and William McCrarey; the first death was that of Widow Mclnturf, in 18 19; the first sermon preached by a Congregational minister was by Rev. Timothy Harris, of Granville, in 181 7; the first convert to Christianity was Ezekiel Scovel, in 1817; the first church society formed was the Congregational, August, 1818; the first infant baptized was by Rev. James N. Wright, in August, 181 8; the first sermon by the Christian denomination was by Rev. Mr. Burge, in 181 9; the first sermon by a Baptist minister was preached by Rev. Mr. Evans, in 181 9; the first male teacher of a district school was Mr. Mountain Everett, in 1817; the first female teacher was Miss Julia Ev erett, afterward Mrs. Thurston, in the summer of 1818; the first Sabbath-school was organized Au gust 13, 1826; the first resident minister of the Gospel was Samuel W. Rose, in 1829; the first resident physician was Dr. Kirkham, in 1832; the first merchant was R. Everett, in 1824; the first post office was established in 1830; the first meet ing-houses were erected in 1832, one for the Con gregational, and one for the Christian society, in the village ; the first postmaster was J. W. Sey-"], [476, "466 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. Rev. John McKean, took charge in May, 1879. The present membership of this church is about sixty, and the children of the members generally attend the union Sabbath-school. There are two Methodist churches in this town ship; one in the village of Hartford and one in the southern part of the township. The latter is known as the Wesley chapel. Mr. James Wright, yet living in the neighborhood of the church, was probably more influential than any other person in organizing this class. Mr. Wright became a local minister and preached for this society many years. The organization was effected, probably, at Wins low's school-house, and their meetings were held here several years prior to the erection of the church. Among the first members were James Wright, E. Thrall, Horace Winslow, and a few others. The church edifice was erected about 1848, near the above named school-house. The present membership is forty or fifty. The Sabbath-school connected with the church was probably organized about the time the church was erected, and has been kept up generally dur ing the summer months to the present time. The Methodist Episcopal church of Hartford was organized fifty years ago or more. Its early records are not in existence, but it was one of the earliest church societies in the town, the Congre tional only, probably, preceding it. Its first meet ings were held in the cabins of the settlers, and in the log building before mentioned as one of the first buildings erected in the town for church and school purposes. Rev. James Wheeler was an itinerant minister of the church in those days, and was probably more influential than any other person in this or ganization. In 1832, the Christians, or New Lights, erected a church building, they having previously organ ized a society here. This Christian organization subsequently became extinct, and their church be came the property of this Methodist society, and its first church edifice. This old church edifice is yet standing and in use as a warehouse. The Methodist church grew quite rapidly in numbers and influence, and in its most prosperous days numbered about one hundred members. This was about 1845, at which time they erected mour, who was followed by I. K. Beem, W. Win slow, T. G Moore and P. H. Graves. The Congregational was the pioneer church of Hartford, being organized August 8, 1818. At that time, the Rev. James N. Wright performed the rite of baptism for the first time in the town ship. Soon after the first settlement of ihe town ship, the citizens erected a small log building, principally for school purposes, but it was intended for and used as a public building, and for some years was the only public building in this section. In it the early preachers of every denomination were invited to preach; the elections were also held here, and all public business, which was not extensive, transacted. In this building the Congregational church was organized by Rev. Timothy Harris, of Granville, and Rev. Ebenezer Washburn, of Genoa. Mr. Washburn died in Blendon, Franklin county,Ohio, in r873, aged eighty-sour years. He was one of the first pastors of this church, giving it half of his time for several years. The members of this first organization were Leonard Bushnel, Ezekiel Scovel, Claudius L. Graves, Elijah Durfey, Ruth Wright, Rachel Scovel, and Electa Graves. The old school-house was burned in 1827, but another was immediately erected and the church continued its meetings here until 1832. It is said that from the date of its organization to that time services had been held every Sabbath but one, and that was when the small-pox was raging. In 1832 their first church edifice was erected, costing only one hundred and seventeen dollars, as much voluntary labor was performed on it. In 1853 the second, and present edifice, was erected, costing fifteen hundred dollars. It was dedicated October 12th of the same year. The ministers who followed Mr. Washburne were Revs. Samuel W. Rose, from 1828 to 1831; H. O. Higley, from 1831 to 1837; Samuel Matti son, from 1837 to i84r; W. B. Brown, from 1841 to 1845; H. M. Parmlee, from 1845 to 1850; David Wurt, from 1850 to 185 1; James Harrison, from 1852 to 1855; H. Y. Booth, Hugh Carlisle, Barks Jenkin, and E. Thompson, from 1856 to T867; L. R. Royce, I. B. Dawson, A. N. Hamlin, Isaac C. Kingsley, D. F. Harris, and D. Sebastian Jones, from 1867 to 1879.

A few of the first and leading mem bers of the class were Willis Clarke, John Bryan, Nason 1 )urfey, and Robert Dolan. Rev. George West was also an early preacher in this church. It seems to have been on the decline in later years, and now numbers about twenty-five mem bers. The children of the members of this church generally attend the Union Sabbath school in the Congregational church. The church located in the northwestern part of the township on the land of Zimri Webb, is now owned by the Christians, better known as New Lights. The Universalists, however, were proba bly influential in erecting the building. This Uni versalist church was organized about 1850, by Rev. Truman Strong; the first members being John Ross, David Ross, Samuel Ross, Mr. Styer, John Bell, William Yearly, and others. Mr. Yearly gave the land for the church edifice. It was not used entirely by the Universalists, other denominations using it whenever convenient and desirable. It was mostly used, however, by the Universalists, Christians and Baptists; quite a number of the lat ter denomination had settled in this part of the township, and frequently held services in this church. They subsequently erected a church building of their own, just over the line, in Dela ware county. After a time the Universalist organization dis banded, and about 1865 the church came into the possession of the New Lights. The earlier and more influential members of this organization were the Webbs, the Potters, and some others. William Webb was a local preacher, and served the society in this capacity some years. The society is not now a strong one. A Sab bath-school was organized there many years ago, and has been kept up with considerable regularity during the summer season until the present time. The Disciple church of Hartford village was or ganized in March, 1850, by Elder William Hays, its original members being Anson Clark, Israel Hoover, Mrs. Emeline Wilson, J. H. Buel, Henry Tracy, Miss C. A. Weaver, Samuel Martin, C. E. Lincoln, John Williams, Mrs. Sarah J. Williams, Mrs. C. J. Hoover, and Joshua Buel. A. Burns, David Weaver, William Taylor, William Hays, and others, have ministered to the church at different times. At present it is not strong in numbers, having twenty-five or thirty members. They have never had a church building, and no regular ser vices are held. The children attend the union Sunday-school, which has a membership of more than one hundred. Three terriffic tornados have passed through the township from west to east, in parallel lines, all within the space of less than two miles, and each occupying a uniform space of half a mile or less. The time the first occurred will probably never be ascertained, nor can its appearance or the full ex tent of its destruction be known. It passed through the center of the township, over the site of the present village of Hartford. Sixty years ago the belt of timber growing here was small, and had every appearance of a second growth. J. Johnson, one of the Welsh pioneers in Gran ville township, was acquainted with this belt, or storm-track, many years before this, and when it was a perfect thicket of undergrowth. No marks of that storm are now perceptible. The second tornado occurred May 18, 1825, and was known as the \"Burlington storm,\" because of the greater damage to the people of that township. It is fully described in the chapter on Burlington town ship. It passed through Hartford township, nearly two miles south of the track of the former storm, its belt of devastation being about the same. The third tornado occurred in June, 1835. This storm passed between the two former. It was terriffic, but not so severe as the others. The following gentlemen have served as justices of the peace in this township: Elijah Durfey, Anson R. Thrall, Revel Everett, James Jordon, William Eddlebute, Abial G. Graves, E. D. An drews, A. B. Clark, A. C. Foote, T. G. Moore, L. P. Rose, D. M. Heath, B.

Many of the citizens of this township were well educated, coming, as they did, from the land of schools and noted institutions of learning, and they felt that they should have something better than common schools, in which their children"], [478, "468 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. for the winter term, but on visiting the camp of the Seventy-sixth regiment at Newark, and seeing how slowly the regiment was being filled, and anxious to do his part in putting down the Rebellion, gave his name as the first private in the formation of company K. Mr. Sperry was chosen a lieutenant in company K, and went into the field with the regiment, never leaving it until the spring of 1863, when his health failing, he resigned and came home. In the spring of 1864, Mr. Sperry removed to Cumberland county, Illinois, where he has since remained, spending each winter in the school room. At the close of Mr. Sperry's teaching in Halcyon, he disposed of his interests in the property to J. W. Seymour. The school was continued with in different success for several years, under various instructors, and finally passed into the hands of district number one, and is now the home of the town schools. Mr. A. B. Clarke, now an honored citizen of Newark, formeily a resident of Hartford, and in this year (1880) a candidate for Congress on the Republican ticket, writes the following regarding matters of historical interest in this township: \"The year 1837 is memorable as the time when, in many portions of the west, the attempt was made to prevent any discussion of the question of slavery, and to repress all associations having the character of abolition societies. Hartford town ship secured for itself an unenviable notoriety for the foolish part it played in that drama. Two peo ples with widely different ideas of life, its respon sibilities and duties, had already made their homes there. The one traced its history to Plymouth rock; the other to Jamestown. One believed in the equality of all men before the law; the other in class legislation. One regarded character as the highest test of manhood; the other looked upon slavery as a divine institution, and the white man's right to \"wollop a nigger\" as an inalienable one. Between the two there was an 'irrepressible conflict.' \"The first settlers of this township \u2014 those who came in 1812-14 \u2014 were mainly of New England origin. Others from the same source came in from year to year, until, in 18 r 8, their numbers had so increased that a Congregational church was could be educated. This feeling culminated in the establishment of Halcyon Academy which was incorporated about 1850, under the general laws of Ohio for such institutions. Among the stockholders were J. W. Seymour, William Spencer, Charles Spencer, Elisha Wood ruff, William Winslow, J. H. Buel, E. C. Buel, P. C. Allen, C. L. Graves, L. J. Wiley, F. Scovill, Adam Franks and many others. The shares were ten dollars each, and nearly one hundred were taken. The materials for the building were fur nished by the individual stockholders. E. C. Buel furnished the shingles; H. Carpenter and W. Winslow, the walnut lumber, and others, different materials. Nimrod Payne was the builder. George L. Mills was the first regular teacher em ployed, and a graduate of Yale college; a man of rare attainments, perfectly familiar with the duties and requirements of the school-room, loving his work, and loved by his working students. Mr. Mills remained in the school some three years, when he removed to Newark, and was engaged there in the city schools, and was also for some time one of the county examiners. In the summer of 1855, Mr. Mark Sperry, a teacher of more than ordinary ability, and living in Hartford, was solicited to go into the academy and open school for a fall term. He did so; and his success was such that he remained there until the close of the fall term in 1861. During Mr. Sperry's teaching more than eight hundred pupils were enrolled in the various terms. Especial instruction was given to those preparing to teach, and it was said by Mr. Mills that the candidates coming from Halycon academy were better pre pared for examination than from any other school in the county. Mr. Sperry was born in New Hampshire in 1818, and was educated in the common schools of that section until arriving at majority, when he spent several terms in the academy at Claremont, and one or two terms in the academy at Chester, Ver mont. He emigrated to Ohio in the fall of 1842, and in 1843, married Lucy A., oldest daughter of J. \\V. Durant, then of Hartford, but formerly of Springfield, Vermont. At the close of the fall term in t86i, Mr. Sperry made active preparations"], [479, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY 469 formed; and five years later, a hewed-log building was erected, which served the double purpose of a school-house and a place for worship. About the year 1835, there was another and considerable accession to their numbers, and these also were of New England origin, and brought with them the Puritan idea of the worth of the church and the school ; and no sooner were they fairly established in their new homes than, in conjunction with those who had preceded them, they set about the work of strengthening the church and organizing an in dependent or select school, \u2014 one with better facili ties and offering better advantages than the com mon school of that day. They had no building suitable for the purpose, but the church had al ready erected a comfortable frame building as a place of worship, and this was at once opened for the school. They had already called a man from Oberlin college to fill their pulpit, and teachers were also obtained from the same place for their school. This was maintained for a number of years by voluntary contributions on the part of those interested in the work of education, and the liberality manifested was highly complimentary to the intelligence and character of all concerned. Many a boy and girl went out from that old build ing not ill-equipped for the work of life; and some of them, to-day, although the snows that never melt are on their locks, remember with infinite de light the lessons conned there, and the companions whom they loved and with whom they labored. They were a goodly company, and although widely separated now (some have gone to the \"other shore\"), many of them are still bearing an honor able part in the world's work. With this brief mention of the character of this people and the work in which they were engaged, it is no matter for surprise that the sentiments promulgated by the early abolitionists found here some warm sup porters. But not far away were unlearned and uncompromising opponents. \"The western portion of the township had been mainly settled \u2014 beginning as early as 1818 19\u2014 by immigrants from Maryland and Virginia. They were men of limited means and more limited culture (many of them were unable to read), and these had brought with them, as already indicated, the southern prejudice against the negro, and any thought of lifting him up and making him the equal of one of their own number, was extremely obnoxious; and they even regarded the advocacy of such doctrines as a crime not to be tolerated. Free thought and free speech, for others formed no part of their political or religious creed. When, therefore, it was made known that the Rev. Mr. R. Robinson, a well-known abolitionist, had accepted an invitation to deliver an anti-slavery lecture in the Congregational church, these men resolved that no such lecture should be delivered, and, on the' day fixed upon for that purpose, assembled in large numbers, took him from the pulpit by force, dragged him through the streets of the village, and treated him in a most brutal manner. Here, also, in March, 1837, the Hon. Samuel White, at that time a resident of the county and subsequently a gentleman of great political prominence, was rode on a rail because of his anti-slavery sentiments. \"The announcement having been made that Mr. White would lecture on a day named, these nun and their sympathizers in the adjoining townships, assembled by hundreds to prevent it. Mr. White, aware of their coming and their intentions, re mained out of town. The mob, however, were soon informed of his whereabouts, and at once proceeded to the country, where he was stopping, marched him to the village, where they required him to get astride a wooden horse, prepared for that purpose, and then several men lifted the horse thus laden on their shoulders and marched forth and back along the principal street of the village. A proposition was then made to black him, and a dish of lampblack and oil was procured for that purpose. Up to this point in the proceedings White had shown little temper, as any resistance on his part seemed useless. There are conflicts, perhaps, in which one may chase a thousand, but it is doubtful if this was one of that nature. He could hardly hope, therefore, to overcome a mob of four or five hundred men by physical resistance. When, however, the blacking was brought forward. White promptly notified those who had him in charge that they could not put it on him while he was alive, and that somebody would be hurt if they attempted it. Thereupon some of the more dis creet of the rioters concluded that the matter had been carried far enough, and White was permitted 20"], [480, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 47\u00b0 to depart; but not without the assurance that he must not at any time in the future attempt to spread his abolition sentiments in that locality. \"On the same day William Spencer, a citizen of the township, was set upon and brutally beaten; and Knowles Linnel and Charles Gunn, the latter now a resident of Granville township, were shame- fully maltreated. A half dozen or more men were striking Spencer at one time, or as nearly so as pos- sible, and the only resistance he made or could well make was an effort to escape from their clutches and blows. And yet while he was being beaten in this brutal manner, and the blood was streaming from the gashes cut in his head by the blows struck by these chivalrous defenders of slav- ery, he fearlessly asserted over and over again, \u2014 \"I am an abolitionist, I am an abolitionist;\" and he was the type of man that had the grit to say it, and say it to the end. \"There were others who only escaped similar treatment by remaining at their own homes. Prominent among these were John W. Seymour, Strong Clark, Anson Clark, and Elisha Woodruff. Threats were freely indulged in as against these men, but it was deemed rather hazardous to attack them in their homes. \"This mob seemed more like a clan of unloosed demons, fresh from the realms of Pluto, than like men. The devil of ignorance was loose, and brutality ruled the hour. Oaths and imprecations fell from all lips, and curses were hurled at all men suspected of a taint of abolitionism. And for months thereafter bands of these men, from six to a dozen or more in number, would visit the vil- lage from time to time, and on their return home in the night hours, when passing the house of an abolitionist, would discharge their fire-arms, fre- quently shooting through the gate, and meanwhile hooting and yelling like so many savages. This probably was designed as a sort of terrorizing pro cess, such as has been practiced of late years in some portions of the south. Anonymous letters of a threatening character were frequently sent to the abolitionists, or were dropped where they would be likely to find them. Some of these are still retained by a younger generation as interest- ing relics of a barbarous time and people. \"The abolitionists at that time were few in num- ber, but they were men who had the courage of their convictions. Prudently but persistently they continued their work. They believed that truth was mightier than error, and never doubted that brain was more than a match for brawn in a pro- longed contest. And they were right. Scarcely more than a score of years had passed away be- fore Hartford Became as noted for its literary cul- ture and its advocacy of all rights for all men as it had formerly been for its ignorance and bru- tality. Time has had its revenges. \"In this brief sketch of events enacted more than two score years ago, we have forborne the mention of the .name of any man who took part in that foolish raid against the rights of humanity and the freedom of speech. It is only fair to say that many of them soon saw their mistake, and were heartily ashamed of the fact that they had been participants in so scandalous an affray. Indeed, they ultimately became earnest workers for the cause which at one time they had contemptuously derided. Let us not judge any of them too harshly, for there is no one of them who now feels any pride in the part he played in that riot. There were other men than those who were responsible; men who had enjoyed far larger opportunities and occupied conspicuous and influential positions in society; men who, if they did not do as brutal a work, were in no less degree the obsequious and cowardly servants of the slave power. They stood in our pulpits and wrote the leaders for our news- papers. Of course, there were some honorable exceptions. But these last two score years have witnessed an immense gain to manhood.\" \"Humanity sweeps onward, where to-day the martyr stands, On the morrow crouches Judas with the silver in his hands; Far in front the cross stands ready and the crackling faggots burn, While the hooting mob of yesterday in silent awe return To glean up the scattered ashes into history's golden urn. \""], [481, "CHAPTER LV.

It was primarily covered with a dense growth of hard wood timber \u2014 oak, beech, sugar, ash, hickory, etc. There was some swamp lands in places, but no prairie, and the pioneers were compelled to cut away the trees to get to their lands, and clear away the timber before they were able to erect their cabins. It is watered principally by South fork and its tributaries. This creek passes across the southern part of the township, its course being generally southeast, from Pataskala to Kirkersville, passing on its way through a small portion of Etna township. Its principal tributary in the township is Grass lick, which rises in the higher lands of the northern part and runs south near the center of the township, entering the main stream near Kirkersville. Grass lick sends out its tributaries at short intervals on its way. Several other small streams and brooks rise in the tow-n ship and flow southward into South fork. These streams are divided from the tributaries of the Raccoon by an irregular ridge or body of high lands in the northern part of the township. The main tributary of South fork on the south is Bloody run, which comes in from Fairfield county, running a little west of north and joining South fork at Kirkersville. The National road crosses the small part of the township in which Kirkersville is situated. The Central Ohio railroad passes across the township, near its center, from east to west, nearly in a bee-line, with but one station, Kirkers ville, within the township limits. The Mound Builders were the first inhabitants in the shape and form of human beings to occupy this territory, so far as known. A few evidences of their works yet remain, though disappearing through the operations of time and the plow. Some years after the first settlement of the town ship two small mounds were plainly visible on what is known as \"Refugee road,\" about half a mile north of Kirkersville. They were probably twenty or thirty feet in diameter at the base and four or five feet in height. One of these has en tirely disappeared, being plowed down in building the road, but the other is yet visible. There is lit tle doubt that many others existed in this direction, but from one cause or another they have mostly or entirely disappeared. Indians occupied the territory in limited num bers for hunting, fishing, and trapping, at the date of the first white occupation, but no permanent camp of these sons of the forest was known to have an existence within the township limits. It was an excellent hunting ground for both whites and Indians, the forest being thick with under brush, forming excellent hiding places for wild ani mals of every description. The Indians who hunted here were, probably, those who had a per manent camp at * Raccoon town, at the head waters of the Raccoon creek. An Indian trail, not much traveled, passed across the township in a northwesterly direction, along South fork, probably used by the Raccoontown Indians in their journeys to \"Little\" and \"Big\" lake (now the"], [482, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 472 Reservoir), which no doubt they visited for the purpose of fishing. This township was taken from the territory in cluded in Union township, and organized in 1816. In addition to the five miles square, a strip of land two and a half miles long from north to south, and one and a half miles wide was taken from the Refugee tract and added to its southeast corner, giving the township an outlet into Fairfield county. This addition contains the village of Kirkersville on the National road. The origin of the settlements of Lima and Har rison townships are so nearly contemporary that the history of one is the history of the other. The first settlements made were on the head waters of the South fork of Licking, near where the village of Pataskala now stands. Mr. Hat field, in the winter of 1805-6, \"slashed\" a small piece of ground near W. H. Mead's sheep shed, for browse for his cattle. That spot was never cleared for cultivation, and is now covered with a beautiful grove of timber of second growth. After building his cabin near the line of the rail road where it passes this grove, and remaining a few years, he disappeared from the settlement and nothing further was heard of him. The next settler was Mr. Henry Drake, who came in 1805, from western Pennsylvania to Lan caster, Ohio, and to Harrison with his young fam ily in 1806, building his cabin on land since owned by the heirs of the late Joseph Baird. Mr. Drake raised quite a large family here. The next settlers were John Evans, Thomas Geary, John Piatte, and William Craige. Evans built a cabin on the land since owned by Joseph Atkinson; Geary, on land since owned by Abra ham Baird; Piatte on land since owned by Abra ham Miller, and Craige, on land since owned by Jesse Horn; his cabin being on the southwest field of Mr. Horn's farm. The children of these settlers attended their first school within the present boundary of Lima township. This first school was taught by Miss Cubberly, in a double log cabin that stood on the ground now occupied by the steam grist-mill, near the village of Pataskala. A little further down the creek Levin Randall and his brother Caleb, settled on land since owned by the heirs of William Stone, so early that they were considered neighbors of those above men tioned. Esquire Randall performed the first mar riage ceremony in the settlement between Mr. Richmond and Miss Cubberly. In 1 8 14, Philip Wagy moved from Fairfield county and bought out John Piatte on the Miller farm. Mr. Wagy raised a large family, most of whom were daughters Joseph Wilcox, from Herkimer county, New York, settled on \"Black's\" road in 18 14, and raised a family of four sons and two daughters. His nearest neighbor must have been William D. Gibbons, who settled one and a half miles north west of hun, some years earlier, but at what date is not known. Mr. Gibbons had been employed by a large land holder (a Mr. Backus, from Blenner hasset's Island, and an accomplice of Aaron Burr), as early as 1806-7, t0 deaden, or girdle, the trees on eighteen hundred acres of land. To compen sate him for his labor he was to receive, and did receive, one hundred acres of land in fee simple. The whole of this deadening was in this township. In 181 5 or 1 81 6, according to Colonel J. C. Alward's recollection, his father, Samuel Alward, came from New Jersey and settled on the farm where the colonel still resides. Their nearest neighbors at that time were, on the west, Captain John Herron, two and a half miles; east, William Gibbons, the same distance, and northeast, Jesse Munson, about three miles. Mr. Alward was at that time about fifty years of age. Being very industrious and economical, he succeeded in se curing for each of his six sons a landed home. He died December 3, 1842, at the age of seventy five. His wife survived him, and died in 186:, aged eighty-six. In 18 16, Mr. Joseph Wells and John Dennison came and settled in the southern part of the town ship, on lands purchased of Hon. William Stan berry, of Newark. Mr. Dennison remained on his farm until 1839, when he sold and removed West. Mr. Wells remained on his farm until his death in 1863, and raised a large family. In 18 16 or 181 7, Joseph Pond settled on a farm in the southeast corner of the township. Some advance was made in settling this town ship between 1820 and 1830, but between 1830"], [483, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 473 and 1840 it rapidly filled up. The building of the National road was no doubt the cause of this. It was in this decade that many came and settled on the road running north and south through the township. It was called \"York street,\" as the set tlers were mostly from New York State. Isaiah Nichols, Henry and Charles Butler and Thomas Munsell, in the northern part of the township, and Jacob Artz in the southern part, erected cabins and settled between the years 1820 and 1830. In early days a large portion of this township was owned by Rathburn, Backus, Hogg, and other non-residents, and their lands remaining uncleared, made an excellent range for wild game, as well as hogs that would stray away from settlements in different parts of the county. One season the hogs of Samuel Thrall, Roswell Graves and oth ers wandered away in the wilderness of Harrison township, as they were wont to do, also into Union and Licking townships. John Ward, who owned and lived on a farm five and one-half miles west of Granville, on the Columbus road, feeling in need of pork, concluded to supply his larder from these woods. Selecting hogs that were in excellend condition, he shot down several. The word soont reached Granville, and those having swine in the woods visited Mr. Ward and found him dressing the game he had secured. Unfortunately for Ward, people in those times were in the habit of putting ear-marks and other marks on their stock before turning them into the commons. Samuel Thrall found, on the ears of two or three of the hogs killed, his mark. Ward was arrested, tried and found guilty of stealing hogs. There was strong talk of a public whipping, but better coun- sels prevailed ; nevertheless, a mark was made on the man as indelible as lash could make, by the community, in naming him \"Hog Ward.\" The principal reason why Harrison and Lima townships were so late in filling up with people, was the fact that much of the land was held by non-residents and was not brought into market. The Rathburn section in Union township, within two miles of Granville, held by Lawyer Downer, of Zanesville, was not offered for sale until the National road was in process of construction in 1832 or 1833. So it was with the Hogg section in this township and the Frisbie section in Lima. As soon as they were offered, P. Atkinson, from New Hamp shire, A. Miller, from western Pennsylvania, and William and Joseph Baird, from western Virginia, came on and purchased land at five dollars per acre, or less. It was in this township that the famous wolf hunt of 1823 occurred, a brief account of which may be interesting, and worthy of preservation. The pioneers were much annoyed by depredations on their sheep folds and pig-pens by wild beasts of the forest. Among these, wolves were the most de structive. Who was the originator of this wolf hunt does not appear on record; but in 1823 the people of the county determined upon a combined effort to extinguish this animal, and to make the experiment as effectual as possible, they determined to surround a specified territory in a methodical and thorough manner, and by marching toward a com mon center, bring them within range of their rifles. For this purpose James Holmes, surveyor of the county, was employed to survey in the western part of the county, a tract of land four miles square. The most of .this tract, if not the whole, was in this township. The east line was the road running north from Kirkersville, and the south line passed a little north of Isaac White's dwelling house. This territory was selected on account of its embracing most of \"Gibbon's deadening,\" be fore mentioned. There were some fifteen hundred acres in this deadening, and no part of it yet cleared for cultivation. It had been deadened some fifteen or sixteen years, and the second growth of timber was in the very best condition to make the deadening a complete harbor for wild animals. So dense was the brush and undergrowth that it was with difficulty men could pass through it on foot. A day was appointed and notice given in all parts of the county, for men to meet at sunrise, and be ready to occupy every part of the surveyed line, which Mr. Holmes had caused to be plainly marked by blazed trees. He had also run diagonal lines through from corner to corner, so as to prevent confusion or mistake in finding the common cen ter. Mr. Holmes was also, more than any other man, zealous in spreading the news and arousing the country. He told all whom he met to be on the ground promptly and bring their dinners, but"], [484, "474 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. no whiskey. \"No whiskey,\" said he, \"is to be al lowed on the ground.\" At sunrise, on the appointed day, a vast crowd gathered at the old Ward place, since better known as the \"cheese farm,\" four miles west of Granville, on the Columbus road. This company was to form the east line. Before separating and being placed on the lines, hornsmen were appointed who were stationed at equal distances around the square, and when the lines w-ere filled on every side, the hornsmen were to sound their trumpets, commencing at a given point, thus conveying the news all around the square that the lines were full. A second sound ing of the trumpets was the signal for all to march. These arrangements were nicely carried out. The lines had advanced but a short distance when frightened deer made their appearance, running parallel with the lines, seeking a place of exit. The rifles now began to crack along the line. Those passing through the deadening, could scarcely prevent the game from escaping through the line, as the bushes and trees were so thick that it could not be seen until very near, and it was difficult shooting. Deer would come bounding to ward the line, and nearly penetrate it before dis covering it, then they would turn quickly and fly in the opposite direction unless stopped by a rifle ball. The wolves kept at a greater distance from the line; they were not seen on the east line until the men were out of the deadening and in more open woods, then they were seen at intervals run ning parallel with the lines, but so far from them that the best shots failed to bring them down. When the lines began to double up a good deal and surround a piece of open woods, the deer ap peared in droves, and the rattle of fire arms sounded like a young battle. As the deer passed along the line, the firing would be continuous for minutes in succession. Thus the day passed, and few indeed were the intervals when the guns could not be heard in some direction. Just as the east line was emerging from the thick undergrowth of the deadening, a large black bear was dis covered, making his way in a lazy gallop toward the southeast corner of the enclosure. No gun was fired at him until he was within twenty or thirty yards of the line; then simultaneously fifteen or twenty guns were fired, and bruin fell to rise no more. Continuously, from the commencement of the march, wild turkeys were seen flying over the lines like flocks of pigeons. The march was continued until lines were reached indicating a fourth of a mile square. It had been anticipated that it might become necessary to halt before reaching the center, and so it was. This one-fourth of a mile line had been surveyed, and the trees blazed. With all the shooting no wolf had yet been killed, and at least, three of these animals had been seen ; they had become cowed, and were skulking behind the logs and under the banks of the stream that meandered through the center of the square. This stream was Grass Lick run, or one of its branches, the hunt culminating on the farm now owned by J. C. Alwood. To kill wolves was now the grand object; the best marksmen were therefore selected at this halting place, and sent in to do that work. The men stood shoulder to shoulder, and no one on the lines was allowed to shoot. Mr. Leverett, Mr. Butler and Captain Timothy Spellman were among those who went in. An incident occurred while dispatching the wolves. Mr. Butler took his brother Henry with him to carry the hatchet. Mr. Butler shot at a wolf and it fell, his brother sprang forward, strad dled the wolf and struck it three blows between the ears, but being greatly excited, struck with the edge instead of the head of the hatchet. The wolf escaped from him but was shot by Mr Lev erett. Three marks made by the edge of the hatchet were discovered between its ears. The skin of this animal being dressed with the hair on, was afterward used by General Munson as a sad dle cloth. When it was announced that there was no more game to kill, all marched to the center. Perfect order was observed, and not a single person ap peared intoxicated, a very remarkable thing for that time, but it went to show that the settlers had cheerfully obeyed the order to take no ardent spir its to the hunt. The management of the whole matter was admirable, and no serious casualty occurred. The game had been brought along as it was killed, and when it was all piled up in the center, it presented a sight never before seen in"], [485, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 475 Licking county, and never can be again. There were the large black bear, three wolves, forty-nine deer, sixty or seventy turkeys, and one owl. The next thing was to prepare the spoils for distribution. The bear and the deer were skinned and cut up into pieces weighing about four pounds each. The number of pieces being ascertained it was found that about every third man would get a piece. The men were, therefore, formed into three companies, and cast lots to see which should have all. This arrangement was satisfactory, and at sunset the company dispersed. General Mun- son drew the bear skin, and wrapped it around him, fleshy side inward, over a new broadcloth coat. Thus ended one of the greatest hunts Lick- ing county ever witnessed or ever will witness. It does not appear that the number of wolves killed was dangerously large, and the probabilities are that the hunt was indulged in more for the \"fun of the thing,\" than for any especial benefit to be derived from the destruction of wolves. Squirrel hunts were indulged in in early times, both as an amusement and as a means of protect- ing the corn crop. These hunts were frequently indulged in as late as 1840 or 1850, and perhaps later. The little destructive creatures sometimes became very numerous, and were sometimes man's most formidable enemy, so that it was indispen- sable that he should be checked in his depreda- tions; and this could be most effectually done by the combined efforts of the people. The time and place of meeting having been agreed upon before- hand, the squirrel hunters met, divided themselves into two companies, elected a captain for each company and then proceeded to their day's work. On coming together in the evening, and reporting results, it was no unusual thing to find the number of squirrels killed that day by the two companies to number many hundreds, and the number not unfrequently ran into thousands. The squirrels were not brought in, only their scalps. Whenever a squirrel was killed the scalp, containing the two ears of the animal went into the pocket of the hunter, and the body was thrown away. These scalps were counted at night, and generally the winning side \u2014 those who could show the most scalps \u2014 were treated to an excellent supper by the losers, and not unfrequently both parties were treated to much beside the supper, and possibly the squirrel hunt might end in a grand carouse, which was continued into the small hours of the night. The National road was the means of building up many towns along its route, and among others Kirkersville, in this township; and, in fact, it is the only village in the township except Kirkersville station. It was laid out in 1832, by Dr. William C. Kirker, who owned some fine land at this point on South fork, at the mouth of Bloody run. He, probably, built the first dwelling in the place. Thomas Youmans was, probably, the first man of family to settle there; he erected a building and kept a \"tavern,\" as these were in great demand along that road, both while it was in course of construction, for the purpose of feeding the work men, and for many years after, for the traveling public. Mr. Bazalleel Brown started the first store, soon after the town was laid out; he also erected a saw mill, and the town grew rapidly for some time, but the advent of railroads checked the growth, by taking the business away from the National road. Some time before Kirkersville was laid out a mill for the manufacture of castor-oil from the bean, had been established, half a mile north of the site of the town on land now owned by L. W. White, on Grass Lick creek. It never accom plished much, and was destroyed by fire. Kirkersville is now a village of three hundred and forty-nine inhabitants by the census of 1880, and contains three or four stores, a hotel, three churches, a planing-mill and the usual number of shops and tradesmen. It probably reached its full growth years ago, and is at present a beauti ful village. Particular attention has been paid to education, and it is doubtful whether Licking county can pre sent an edifice for public school purposes, equal in external beauty and internal convenience to the building erected a few years ago for such purpose, chiefly under the superintendence of Mr. Freder ick Schofield, a merchant in the village. When the railroad was constructed through the township, it passed two and a half miles north of the village, and Kirkersville station was estab lished. This, at present, contains a post office"], [486, "476 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. March 17, 1836, Rev. C. M. Putnam preached in Kirkersville, and assisted in organizing a Pres byterian congregation. He preached at Kirkers ville once a month, from April 9, 1837, until the following October. In July, 1837, a protracted meeting was held in Mr. Joseph Baird's barn, in Harrison township, conducted by Revs. Henry Little and Jonathan Cable. A large number were converted, and on the eleventh of November following, a Presbyterian church was organized at the log school-house in Lima township. During the following year there was preaching only occssionally to the Kirkersville congregation, in a school-house in the village. In the summer of 1838, Revs. Hugh Carlisle and Francis Bartlett preached occasionally for these churches. October 14, 1838, Rev. T. W. Howe preached for these Presbyterian congregations, the meetings of the Harrison township congregation being held in a frame school house at the northwest corner of Kirkersville. In the fall of 1839, a subscription was started for the purpose of building a church in Kirkers ville. The building progressed slowly and was not used until r842, and not finished and dedica ted until March, 1845. A bell was procured, cost ing about two hundred dollars. The people of Granville gave one hundred and fifty dollars to ward building this church. In T852, forty-four persons, living more conven ient to the Kirkersville church, joined that church by letter, and organized the First Presbyterian church of Kirkersville. This church employed Rev. H. C. McBride to preach for them one-half his time. He supplied them two years. Rev. Jesse Schlosser followed, and supplied them until the spring of 1858. From the spring of 1858 to January 1, 1870, Rev. T. W. Howe ' preached for them every alternate Sabbath. Mr. Howe was succeeded by Rev. Reuben Hahn. The church is without a regular pastor at present. The member ship is about one hundred. The Methodist Episcopal church in Kirkersville originated at \"Fletcher's chapel,\" in Fairfield county, its original members belonging to that church. Sometime after Kirkersville was laid out, the called \"Outville,\" a telegraph office, depot build. ing, two stores and a few dwellings. There are at present but three churches within the limits of this township, all located at Kirkers ville \u2014 the Presbyterian, Methodist Episcopal and Baptist. The first church organization in this township, however, was near its northern line, and was known as the Welsh Congregational church of Harrison. Nearly half a century ago a nnmber of Welsh families settled on both sides of the line, between the townships of St. Albans and Harrison, and soon formed themselves into a religious organiza tion known as the Welsh Congregational church of Harrison township. Without unnecessary de lay they erected a church building, in which for many years they maintained public worship in the Welsh language. After the generation that erected the church had nearly all passed away, and the succeeding generation all speaking the English language, they gradually became absorbed by the surrounding English churches, and public services in Welsh could no longer be sustained. Under these circumstances the organization be came extinct. Revs. John Powell, Jenkin Jenkins, David R. Jenkins and John Williams were pastors of this church at different times, and perhaps about in the order named. The church building was sold some years since, and is now private property. Revs. Thomas W. Evans and William Parry also ministered to this church occasionally, and a Sunday-school was connected with it. The descendants of Theophilus Rees were among the original members of this church. The Presbyterian Church of Kirkersville: \u2014 Rev. Jacob Tuttle came from New Jersey in 1832, and commenced preaching in Lima, Harri son and Etna townships in the spring of 1833, and continued to do so more or less regularly until the spring of 1837. He was highly esteemed, and his memory is cherished by his neighbors and friends. The first Presbyterian minister who preached in Kirkersville was Rev. Jonathan Cable, at the time supplying the church in Hebron, which has ceased to exist. His diary states that he preached three times in Kirkersville in 1834, and once in January, t335-"], [487, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 477 members living near the town organized a class, and held meetings some time in the' Presbyterian church, but in a few years erected the present frame building. The Baptist church at Kirkersville also origin ated in Fairfield county, its first members being regular attendants at what is known as the \"Refu gee\" church. Their first meetings were also held in the Presbyterian church. Both of these societies are active and well sus tained. CHAPTER LVL HOPEWELL TOWNSHIP.

These gradually sloping projections or juts of land, of short but unequal lengths, extend at irregular intervals or distances into the more level and less rugged surrounding country. Flint ridge is situated within the United States mili tary lands, and in the southern tier of townships of said lands, which border on the Refugee tract, and is distant from the northern boundary line of said Refugee tract but little more than a mile. Hopewell township, Muskingum county, it may be observed, extends two miles and a half into the Refugee tract. To recapitulate, in a word, Flint ridge is, in round num bers, over eight miles long and more than two miles wide, sev eral miles of its eastern portion being in Hopewell township, Muskingum county, five miles of it in Hopewell township, Licking county, and over a mile (its western part) in Franklin township, of the last named county. \"Flint ridge is an elevated locality of varying height and uneven surface. The maximum altitude of its summit is stated by Professor E. B. Andrews, in the \"Preliminary Geological Survey of Ohio,\" issued in 1869, to be onehundred and seventy feet above the surrounding country ; two hundred and twenty feet above Newark ; three hundred and seventy-four feet above Zanesville ; four hundred and ninety feet above Marietta, and seven hundred and twenty-nine feet above Cincinnati. The general aspect of the scenery of Flint ridge, when first settled bv white men, early in the present century, was of a decidedly wild, rugged character. Its steep hill sides, its high peaks, its deep, dark glens, its huge rocks, its craggy cliffs, its cavernous dells, its abrupt acclivities, its coverings of hornstone or crystal quartz, its drift boulders found even upon its summit, so sug gestive of the glacier theory, or the great ice age, its abundant buhr-stone or calcareous-silicious rock, also called flint or chert, with which its surface was so abundantly supplied, while also its tall and heavy growth of chestnut and several varieties of oak and poplar, and some hickory, all over-run by the luxuriant grape-vine and other creepers, as well as its prolific and dense undergrowth, in great part of scrub-oak, stunted shrubs and creeping vines, all tended to present to the eye of the pioneer On this ruggedest rimm'd frontier, ' Where the hills huddle up in disorder, Like a fold in mortal fear ; Where the mountains are out at the elbow In their yellow coats, seedy and sere, Where the river runs sullen and yellow, Through all the days of the year. \u2014 Joaquin Miller. THERE is much interesting and valuable his- tory within the limits of this township. That the Mound Builders once occupied its terri tory, their still existing works afford ample proof. These works consist of mounds and other earth works ; also of numerous wells, of various depths, ranging from two to twenty feet. The Flint ridge, a region of much interest to the scientist and antiquarian, is mostly in this township. What follows in regard to this interest ing region, is from the pen of Hon. Isaac Smucker: \" Flint ridge is situated on both sides of the line that divides Hopewell township, Muskingum county, from Hopewell town ship, Licking county, Ohio. It is an elevated locality of from eight to nine miles in length, from east to west, and has an aver age breadth from north to south of more than two miles, not including the many short spurs that branch out from it. The eastern termination of Flint ridge, which slopes off gradually, re several miles east of the west line of Hopewell township, Muskingum county, being about eight miles west of Zanesville, and extends westward eight miles or more, across Hopewell township, Licking county, and continues nearly a mile and a half into Franklin township, of the last named county, termi nating at a point eight miles southeast of Newark, the county seat of Licking county. All around the outer edges, or exterior"], [488, "478 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. and quality they are not unlike those of the adjacent lands, produced, it may be, in somewhat^ diminished quantities per acre. Neither do I intend to present its recent history, nor even relate any of the weird legendary tales, or probably fabu lous stories, of however romantic interest they might be, with which the flint ridge has been connected, nor of the old-time traditions which identified this locality with the early races, nor give currency, by recital with pen, to stories of wild adventures, by Indian, hunter, or pioneer, of which it was the scene. \"That the Mound Builders once occupied the Flint ridge admits of no doubt; their still existing works of which there are some eight or ten in number, albeit some of them have been al most obliterated by the plow, furnish ample proof. They are all composed of earth except one, which was constructed of flint stones; and they are all either sepulchral or signal mounds, varying in height from five feet to fifteen feet, and in diameter from ten feet to a hundred feet. Some of them have been opened and found to contain the usual deposits of ashes, char coal, bones, skeletons, pottery (in fragments), and some mound builders' implements. In two of them were found shell beads, stone axes, and arrow-heads. One of the signal mounds, or mounds of observation, says Mr. William Anderson, an intel ligent and enthusiastic arch\u00e6ologist, formerly a resident of the ridge, commands a view of another some five miles distant to the southwest, and he states that from said mound (which is also one of observation), he followed the line of signal mounds to the Ohio river, at a point in Meigs county. The flint mound was, on exploration, ascertained to be of the sepulchral class, two skeletons being found within it, together with some beads and mica in sheets, eight by ten inches in size. The beads were made of marine shells, such as are found in the Gult of Mexico, with few of river mussel, pierced for the cord or string. \"Of lines of circumvallation, there are several circular en closures, and one four-sided figure (parallelogram). Their walls vary in height from two feet to five feet, and in diameter from thirty feet to one hundred feet. The banks of one of them was ascertained to be composed, in part, of stone. When openings occur in the enclosures, they are on the east side. \"It has been long known (says Colonel Charles Whittlesey, in Historical Tract, No. 5, page 36), that a flint bed existed on Flint ridge, that had been extensively quarried in ancient times, the hundreds of old pits, some of them twenty feet deep, and covering more than a hundred acres, bear testimony to the extent of the labors of the Mound Builders here. These pits or \"wells,\" as they are provincially called, are partially filled with water, and are surrounded by broken fragments of flint stones that had undoubtedly been rejected by those who attempted, but tailed to shape them into implements, for only clear and homogeneous pieces could be wrought into knives and arrow or spear-points. With what tools and appliances the ancients wrought such extensive quarries, has not yet been settled. This flint, continues Colonel Whittlesey, is of a grayish white color, with cavities of brilliant quartz crystals. It appears the stones were sorted and partially chipped into shape, on the ground, after which they were carried great distances over the country as an article of traffic. Many acres of ground are now covered with flint chips, the result of 'this trimming process. The business of manufacturing arrow-points, scrapers, knives, spears, axes, wedges and other implements, was doubtless a trade among the Mound Builders, as the making of some of them, at least, is known to have been among the Indians. In- deed, that branch of manufactures' (the making of flint knives. landscapes of a kind, unquestionably mountain-like, and of natural scenery, romantic, wild and grandly picturesque. \"The rain that falls on the north half of Flint ridge finds its way to the Licking river by way of the Clay lick, Bear run and Brushy fork streams, and thence by way of the Licking river into the Muskingum, at Zanesville ; and that which falls on the south side of the ridge flows into the Muskingum river, by way of some rivulets and Jonathan's creek (in early times known as Moxahala), which empties into the Muskingum several miles below the mouth of the Licking river, whose mouth is opposite Zanesville, as already stated. \"The Mound Builders were once occupants of the flint ridge and erected works upon it, some of which still remain. And that the Indians, too, in pre-historic times, and later, also roamed over its rugged surface and occupied it after their vagrant, sav age manner, there can be no doubt. They, probably, like their predecessors, also sought the flint -for manufacture into knives and spear and arrow heads. This I will endeavor to make ap parent when I come to present the arch\u00e6ological aspects of the ridge. \"On the north of Flint ridge and along the Licking river,xboth above and below the Narrows, settlements by white men were first made in the year 1798\u2014 south of the ridge, at the Little Bowling Green, a settlement by white men was effected in 1802 \u2014 west of it, on a 'tributary of Hog run, the first white settle ment was made in 1805, and about the same time the country east of the ridge was first occupied by white settlers. And it was only a year or two later when the flint ridge attracted set tlers to it who were seeking homes. It was a locality which, in its natural state, was peculiarly favorable to the subsistence and increase of the wild animals and birds of prey usually found in our forests, in primitive times, such as panthers, wildcats, bears, catamounts, wolves and others more or less annoying and for midable as man's enemies, also hawks, owls, eagles, vultures and other birds characterized by marauding, thievish and de structive proclivities. The flint ridge was most admirably adapt ed to their growth, preservation and multiplication, affording them ample subsistence and comparatively secure coverts or hiding places. The conditions on the ridge being thus favorable to them, in fact, inviting their presence, they quite naturally be came more numerous, and were enabled, by their numbers, to be all the more annoying and destructive, while thus jointly with the pioneers, occupying that locality, and were also ena bled to remain longer to indulge in their predatory habits, be cause of the favorable conditions that environed them. \"The buffalo and the elk were not occupants of the Flint ridge contemporaneously with the Anglo-Saxon. They proba bly disappeared simultaneously with the red men, or more likely before the latter finally retired before the advancing hosts of the white race. That they were formerly here in numerous herds does not admit of a doubt \u2014 in fact, it is of authentic historical record. The last time a herd of wild buffaloes appeared in the Muskingum valley, was in 1803. It consisted of only six or eight that had strayed away from their accustomed haunts west of the Scioto river, and were pursued by some hunters to the valley of Wills creek, east of the Muskingum river. The buf- falo occupied these forests some years later than the elk, and the panther and catamount retired a few years after the buffalo. \"The Flint ridge is now apparently as densely populated as the neighboring country, probably not more than half of it re- maining in forest; but it is not my purpose to speak of its agri- cultural products, except to say in general terms, that in kind"], [489, "HISTORY FO LICKING COUNTY. 479 spears and arrow-points), is now flourishing among the Digger Indians of Calitornia, who in their mental and moral develop ment fairly represent the diluvial cave-dwellers. There is a strong probability that all the pointed and sharp-edged articles made of flint were, after being wrought into their general form, brought to completion and given their sharp point or edge, by violent pressure, that is, by the use of the thumb stones. Col. Whittlesey, than whom there is no higher authority on this point, thinks that flint knives, spears, and arrow-points were made and used more extensively by the Red men than by the Mound Builders, for the reason that the latter, being agricul turists and probably a pastoral people, had less frequent occa sion to use them than the former, who were more given to the chase and to war. Both, however, undoubtedly used them more or less as hunters and in their amusements. The late Colonel J. W. Foster, an eminent scientist, and dis tinguished as the learned author of \" Pre-Historic Races of the United States,\" says that the deposit on the Flint ridge is in the form of a chert, often approaching to chalcedony and jas per in external characters, and that it, afforded an admirable material for arrow heads. From the abundance of flint chip pings he thought this locality was evidently^much resorted to and its deposits extensively wrought into various implements, and largely utilized by both the Mound Builders and Indians. These were his conclusions after tolerably thorough explorations of the ridge more than forty years ago, while a member of the first geological corps of Ohio. ' Here the ancient arrow-maker Made his arrow-heads of quartz>ock \u2014 Arrow-heads of chalcedony, Arrow-heads of chert and jasper \u2014 Smoothed and sharpened at the edges, Hard and polished, keen and costly.' 'Dr. Hildreth, in his report submitted to the legislature of Ohio, in 1838, says, 'that from a remote period the Glint ridge, which he had just had under examination, had furnished a valu able material to the aboriginal inhabitants for the manufacture of knives, spears and arrow-heads. How extensively it had been worked for these purposes may be imagined from the al most countless numbers of excavations and pits yet remaining from whence they dug the quartz ; experience having taught them that the rock recently dug from the earth could be split with much greater facility than that which had been exposed to the weather.' \" The American Antiquarian society of Worcester, Massachu setts, in 1818, accepted for publication, an elaborate paper from Caleb Atwater, esq., of Ohio, descriptive of western antiqui ties, in which a page, was devoted to the Flint ridge. He made mention of its hundreds of pits, or 'wells,' some of which be ing then (sixty-two years ago), more than twenty feet deep, giv ing the opinion that they were manifestly not dug, whether by the Mound Builders or Indians, or both, to procure water, either fresh or salt, nor in pursuit of the precious metals, but to secure a softer and more workable quartz, or flint, than was present on the surface, for manufacture into spear-heads, knives, and arrow-points. And on that point there is now but little difference of opinion. It may be observed that the exca vations above mentioned date back to a period anterior to the time of the first settlement of the country by the white race. \"Professor Read, on page 354, of the third volume of the .Geology of Ohio,' observes that 'any one traversing the Flint ridge for the first time, would be surprised to find such a deposit on such a geological horizon. It simulates very accu rately the broken-up debris of a vertical dike, the fragments often covered with perfect crystals of quartz, the rock itself be ing highly crystalline and often translucent. It is something of a puzzle,' he continues, 'to understand how such a deposit is found in a series of undisturbed and unmodified sedimentary rocks. The adjacent surfaces of two blocks of the chert are often found covered with quartz crystals of considerable size, as thoroughly interlocking with each other as if one were the cast and the other the mould.' The learned professor seems to be at a loss to imagine conditions which would spread such a de posit over the floor of a sea or any other body of water, but inclines to the opinion that a substitution of silicious matter deposited from solution, in the place of a soluble limestone previously deposited, is the most plausible view of the case. \"Heaps or piles of flint chippings, composed of unworkable or broken pieces, and of imperfect, half-finished and spoiled implements, found in various localities remote from Flint ridge, and not in the vicinity of any known deposit of that material, but exactly corresponding in quality with that on the ridge, raises the presumption that considerable of the flint quarried there was carried away and manufactured elsewhere. Much of it, however, as the quantity of chips around the quarries indi cate, was doubtless put into shape there. \"Mr. Anderson, of whom I have already made mention, several years ago, explored and further excavated quite a num ber of the pits or \"wells\" on the ridge, and reported finding some stone axes, flint disks, and some balls, apparently well worn, made of greenstone. More careful, thorough and exten sive exploration of the pits or \" wells\" of the Fiint ridge would undoubtedly result in giving us much more information than we now possess, as to the character of implements used, and the modes of mining practiced there, by the earlier races, who ever they were, and whenever they made these excavations on the ridge. \"Some modern excavations have been made on Flint ridge, by individuals and associations, to find out what the ancient diggers were after, and some of them also prospected for lead, silver and gold, but without valuable results. \"It is the province of ethnology to tell us about the races of mankind that have occupied the Flint ridge, particularly of the pre-historic race orraces. In pre-historic times the Mound Build ers, perhaps for many ages, occupied the ridge, but they have left us no history. Their works are their history. They proba bly had no written language, or at least no language brought to such a state of perfection as to have been employed in writing their history. They were probably Mongolians and reached the American continent by crossing Behring's Straits, or byway of the Aleutian Islands, on our northwest coast; or they may have reached our continent by way of the Atlantic ocean as the Northmen did at the close of the tenth century; or as Madoc, the Welsh navigator did, in 1170, A. D. ; and as Columbus did in 1492, A. D. ; or as some later navigators did. And there is another theory, and it is not an unreasonable one, that is, that the Mound Builders were an indigenous race, or were descended from the Toltecs of Mexico, and therefore a continuation of one. and hence, in either case, were 'natives and to the manor born. \"But there were no insurmountable difficulties in reaching this continent from any of the other quarters of the globe. Our northwest coast can now be reached in summer, in small sailing vessels, and in winter on the ice, the distance across be ing only thirty-six miles. Moreover there is reason to think"], [490, "48o HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. that Behring's Strait was once an isthmus, and if so, the jour ney from Asia to America was altogether practicable. \"We know that the Mound Builders once held Flint ridge, and we know of no earlier occupants there. They there built mounds and enclosures for various purposes heretofore desig nated. They probably cultivated the soil; were more agricul turists than hunters or warriors; perchance had flocks and herds; made flint arrow-points and spear-heads on the ridge, as well as other implements, also ornaments, and probably pot tery, too. All that we know of them is gathered from their works which still remain. They once occupied the ridge, built some works there, and have disappeared. We do not know, with certainty, where they came from (if they were not natives), when and how they came, when and how they happened to drop out of sight, whether by war, pestilence or famine, or by a gradual, slow, southwestern emigration movement, ultimately reaching Mexico and suffering absorption there by an existing and dominant race; or meeting with the possible destiny of ul timately coming within the domain of history as Toltecs or Aztecs, or some other ancient people, once of pre-historic times in Mexico or Central America; or whether they degenerated into barbarians, and had for their successors and lineal de scendants the North American Indians that have roamed in savagery over our woods and prairies during the last three cen turies, and perhaps much longer. \"Considered physically, intellectually and morally, the Mound Builders probably held an intermediate position between the Caucasians and the most civilized portion of Mongolians above them, and the uncivilized inhabitants of the interior of the Malay peninsula below them. \"The Mound Builders were undoubtedly a numerous people and if numerous of necessity an agricultural people; a people of some mechanical skill, a people who had probably estab lished a strong government by which they were readily held in subjection; a people of some mathematical and engineering knowledge, a superstitious people given to sun worship, and to the offering of animal and sometimes of human sacrifices- Reasons can be given for each of the above expressed opin\" ions, but I will not occupy space for that purpose; moreover, those reasons will naturally suggest themselves to every one who has carefully examined the subject. For a more elaborate presentation of matters pertaining to this ancient race, see ' Ohio Statistics for 1877,' pages 15-27. \"The Indians were doubtless later occupants of the Flint ridge than the Mound Builders. They strolled in idleness and worthlessness, perchance sometimes stealthily, and again in fierce savagery over the ridge, probably for centuries, engaged alternately in war, hunting, and in making flint spears and ar_ row-heads, and finally gave up the contest for supremacy in the interest of barbarism, and sullenly, reluctantly yielded to the irresistible influences and onward march of the civilization of the nineteenth century, conscious that they could maintain the contest no longer.\" In the chapters on Geology and Arch\u00e6ology, further reference is made to Flint ridge. The chestnut and other growths peculiar to mountain regions abound on Flint ridge, and the oak, in different varieties, prevails in other por tions of Hopewell. The land is of the class re- garded as hilly, but it is for the most part produc tive. No large water courses are found in Hopewell, yet springs are not rare, and rivulets are coursing their way through all parts of the township. On the plat of the original survey, this township is in the first tier of townships, and tenth range. It was first settled about 1805 or r8o6. Wil liam Hull, Isaac Farmer, Samuel Pollock, Edward Hersey, John Bartholomew, Jacob Hummell, Thomas Hummell, Timothy Gard, James Glas gow, Isaac Davis, John, Charles, George and Sam uel B. Hull, Thomas Demoss, George Kreger, Daniel Bowman, Abraham Bennett, Samuel Far mer, William Willis, Andrew Livingston, Blois Wright, Alexander, Charles, and Zachariah Shaw, Archibald Kelso, and the Gibbons, were early set ters. The township was organized in 1814. Isaac Farmer and Samuel Pollock were the first justices of the peace, and were elected early in 18 15. The former soon resigned, and Edward Hersey suc ceeded him, and served until 1830, when he re signed. The latter served until 1818, when he was succeeded by William\" Hull, who served about twenty years. He was, meanwhile, in 1827, elected to the legislature, in which body he served one year. Gratiot is situated on the National pike, imme diately on the county line betw-een Muskingum and Licking. It was laid out by Adam Smith, about fifty years ago, very soon after the permanent location of the National road, and named in honor of General Gratiot, then in active service in the reg ular army. It came to be a post town of about three hundred inhabitants. It contains two churches \u2014 Episcopal Methodists and Protestant Methodists \u2014 each having a good building, and enjoying a good degree of prosperity. The former is much the older, having been organized in 1830, soon after the town was laid out. The latter has a good church edifice, a large society, and Sabbath-school, but the building is in Muskingum county. There is, in the immediate vicinity of Gratiot, a Baptist church which can properly be classed with the pioneer churches of Licking county, it having been in existence since 182 1 \u2014 a period of fifty nine years."], [491, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 481 The first Meth'odist society in Hopewell town ship, as well as the first of any denomination, was organized at the residence of widow Dickinson, one mile, or more, north of Brownsville, in 1816, \u2022 by that veteran preacher of the wilderness, Rev. James Quinn. The society erected a log church in 1818; and as both stoves and money to pay for them were scarce in those days, on the Fiint ridge, they warmed up in winter by burning char coal in a square wooden box, lined with stone and mortar, placed in the church. Revs. J. McMahon, Martin Fate, Michael Ellis, Joseph Carper, Abner Goff, James Quinn, and others, were the pioneer preachers of this society. Mr. Landon Warfield was the class-leader. The socie ty was transfered to Brownsville in T829, where they erected a brick church, of which mention is made in the history of Bowling Green township. The second society organized in this township was the above mentioned Baptist church in 182 1, located half a mile northwest of Gratiot. Rev. Thomas Snelson and Rev. Mr. Caves were among its earliest ministers; and William Baker, Jesse Stith, John Parker and Daniel Schofield succeeded them. Among its first members were Adam Smith, Daniel Drumm, Samuel Winegarner, James Red man, Thomas White, Isaac Smith, Margaret Wine garner and Henry Claybaugh. The society erect ed a church in 1823, which was superseded by the neat, substantial building now occupied. The original deacons were Adam Smith and James Redman. In 1830, Rev. Robert McCracken, and others, organized an Episcopal Methodist church in Gra tiot, which held its meetings in a school-house until 1836, when they erected a good church edifice. Lewis Ijams and William Tucker were mainly influential in the first establishment of this society. Rev. Joseph Carper and Rev. Abner Goff were pioneer preachers in this church. The first Sabbath school in this township was organized in this church in r83o, Mr. Lewis Ijams being superin tendent. It is yet a large and active school. In 1832, Rev. Joseph Carper and Rev. Jacob Young organized a Methodist Episcopal society in the western portion of the township, with Mr. Samuel B. Hull as class-leader. The society erected a church some time after, and now wor ships in what is known as Spencer chapel. A flourishing Sabbath-school is connected with the church. Revs. Samuel Hamilton, Robert McCracken, Martin Fate, Leroy Swormsted, James B. Finley, C Springer and others were among the pioneer preachers of this township. Hopewell is divided into school districts as other townships, and provided with good school houses. The pioneer teachers were Charles How ard, Joseph Evans and George Hursey. Politically, the township is Democratic. The only post office is at Gratiot. The first postmaster was Moses Meek. He was succeeded by Samuel Winegarner, Nathan Henslee, William Sims, S. R. Tucker, F. F. Dutton, L. A. Stevens, William Redman and Stephen R. Tucker. Two agricultural societies have been organized in Hopewell, both holding some of their meetings in Gratiot. The \"Gratiot Farmer's club\" was or ganized in 1865. Its meetings were generallv held at the residences of the members. The \"Farmers' and Mechanics' association\" was organized in 1869, and held their meetings monthly in Gratiot. William Hull and Samuel Winegarner can be ranked among the most successful politicians of the township, the former being elected a member of the lower branch of the legislature in 1827, and the latter to the State senate in 1845. They were early settlers and men of influence."], [492, "CHAPTER LVII. JERSEY TOWNSHIP.

Three years after this date, the first settlers found a few of their huts and wig wams standing, though greatly dilapidated, on a small stream called Indian run, half a mile north west of the village of Jersey. Evidently its beech woods and pretty brooks made a paradise in which the Indian hunter delighted to roam. In the month of February, 18 15, Joseph Head ley, Peter Headley and a colored man, left their homes at the falls of Licking in Muskingum coun ty, and camped on the South fork near the present village of Jersey. They split puncheons and built a sort of structure in which they lived, and made sugar. Peter Headley soon went to the land office at Chillicothe and entered or purchased the south east quarter of section twenty-four for himself; the southwest quarter for Mr. Lewis Martin, and the northwest quarter for Richard Osborn. Peter Headley, during the spring of 181 5, built a cabin on his land, and moved into it in March, 181 6, with his wife and two children, David and Elizabeth ; he was, therefore, the pioneer of Jersey township. He erected the first cabin, but its first occupants were Lewis Martin and others, In May, 1816, Joseph Headley and wife, with their daughter, Polly, and Sarah Parritt joined Peter Headley and lived with him in his cabin. In November, 1816, William, son of Peter Headley, was born, being the first child born in the town ship. The Headleys were from New Jersey, from whence they emigrated to Muskingum county in 1809. They were first-class pioneers and good \" Be evn as clover with its crown of blossoms, Even as blossoms ere the bloom is shed, Kissed by the kine and the brown sweet bee \u2014 Foi these have the sun and moon and air, And never a bit of the burthen of care And with all our caring what more have we?\" \u2014 Joaquin Miller. THIS township is in the western part of the county, and is bounded on the north by Mon roe township; south by Lima; east by St. Albans, and west by Franklin county. It slopes gradually to the south. Black Lick, which flows into the Big Walnut ; and the South fork of Licking, w-hich has its source in this township, are its principal streams. The latter waters the southern part, while numerous tributaries of the Raccoon flow from the eastern and northeastern part. The east ern half is what is called rolling land, and the western half is level or slightly undulating. The early settlers considered portions of it too wet for cultivation; but as the forest was cleared away, letting in the sun and air, it became apparent that the pioneers were mistaken, as beneath the dense beech shade lay a soil well worth the labor of clearing. It is generally productive. The town ship was covered with a good variety of timber, but beech was the prevailing timber, and it was considered as belonging to the \"beech woods\" in early times. The Mound Builders left traces of their exist ence here, though their works do not appear to have been as extensive as in some other portions of the county \u2014 but four mounds being visible w-ithin its limits, and these are not of large size, Perhaps its clayey soil was not adapted to their purposes.

Peter, on one occasion, killed seven deer on his own place in one day; at another time he killed two deer at one shot, and on another oc casion killed a bear weighing over four hundred pounds. Mr. Lewis Martin, also from New Jersey, pros pected in Jersey township in r8i5, and with his father-in-law, Richard Osborn, and a brother-in law, Mr. Vandegriff, with their families, also Mrs. Martin's brother, moved there, June 15, 1815, and occupied a cabin erected by Peter Headley. In a month Mr. Martin had erected a cabin on his own land \u2014 the land having been entered by Peter Head ley for him. These were the first settlers of Jersey township. They were compelled to cut a wagon road several miles before reaching the land they had determined to settle upon. Mr. Martin sowed some wheat in i8r5, the first in the township, but it all run into straw and made nothing but horse feed. Martin was a prominent citizen, serving the township often in the different capacities of trustee and justice of the peace. He died February 2, 1872, and just two weeks after, February 16, the remains of his venerable wife were also deposited by his side. They were eighty three and eighty-one years respectively. One of their sons, Lewis, now deceased, com manded an Illinois regiment in the late war. In March, 18 16, Michael Beem, also a Jersey man, and a Revolutionary soldier, who served in the body-guard of General Washington, and knew him well, came to Jersey and erected a cabin. He brought with him eight sons and one daughter, and lived in the township thirty-four years, dying December 12, 1850, at the age of nearly ninety-six years. John Rhodes, and a son and daughter, came to Jersey in May, 1815, and lived three weeks in a sort of rail pen until they could build a cabin. Samuel Williams and family, and Abner White head and family, both from New Jersey, settled in this township, in September, 181 6. Phebe White head, a daughter of Abner, died January 18, 1819, her death being the first in the township. In 1820 Mr. Whitehead erected a small log mill, on the South fork, the first in the township. It stood north of the Jersey village, at the crossing of the Jersey and Johnstown road. Benjamin Parkhurst settled in Jersey in the spring of 1817. He was from New Jersey, and on his way west his son Peter was born on the Alleghany mountains. Soon after his arrival he erected a hand mill, upon which himself and a few scattered settlers ground grain, before other mills were erected. Amos Park, a Virginian, also settled here in r8i7. Thomas Alberry settled here in i8r7, building his cabin on the South fork, where the Worthington road crosses it, and where he died March 1, 1867, aged seventy-two years. Elijah Meeker and family moved from New Jersey to this township in 181 7. He had six daughters and three sons. The first marriage in the township was that of his daughter Susan to John Osborn. The ceremony was performed by Rev. George Callahan, a Methodist, probably the first preacher in the township. David Meeker and family, and David Peffers and family, from New Jersey, settled here in Sep tember, i8r7, and the following year Onesimus Whitehead and Elias Williams, with their families, from New Jersey, also settled here. Wickliffe Condit and family were immigrants from New Jersey in 1819. Mr, Condit established the first tannery, and erected the first frame house in the township, Deacon Josiah Ward being the architect. Mr. Condit also had some agency in the sale of the first merchandise, having for his partners at different times E. O. Williams, A. D. Pierson, Dr. Beecher and Knowles Linnel. Asa Whitehead, with his wife and eight children, from New Jersey, settled in this township in 1820. Louis Headley, a young man, came with his father (Joseph) in 1816, married in 1822, and soon thereafter built the first saw-mill in the township, and also erected the first frame barn. The saw mill stood on the South fork, just south of the vil lage of Jersey. It will be seen that the early settlers of this town ship were nearly all from New Jersey, which fact gave the township its name. They were men of character and family, and were first-class pioneers. The township was organized in 1820, by dividing St. Albans. Peter Headley, Richard Beem and Elias Williams were the first trustees; Amos Park, clerk; David Chad wick, constable; Enos Williams, treasurer; Charles Beardslee, lister, and Deacon"], [494, "484 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. Josiah L. Ward, appraiser. Michael Beem was the first justice of the peace. By a unanimous vote of the citizens the township was named \"Jer sey.\" The first school-house was erected in 1819, and was a primitive affair, the light being admitted through greased paper pasted over openings on each side of the house, made by cutting out a log. It stood on the farm of Onesimus Whitehead. Benjamin Alward was the first teacher. Granville was the nearest post office for the first settlers. In 1830 a post office was established at the point where Jersey village was afterward located. At present there is a second office in the township, called Beech post office. Jersey village was laid out in 1832 by Wickliffe Condit, Lewis Headley, Edward Beecher and An drew Pierson. It is not a large town, but still contains a post office, a few dwelling houses, and, perhaps, one hundred people. This township is better supplied with churches than any other in the county, except Newark. Ten churches have been organized; nine only having an existence at present, a Methodist church having removed to Lima township. The Presby terian was the earliest organized. Deacon Ward in 1819 began holdirijLJneetings in the cabins of the settlers, for singing, prayer and the reading of sermons. The first sermons preached in the town ship were in July, 181 7, by Rev. Benjamin Green, a Baptist preacher from Hog run, and by Rev. Timothy Harris, pastor of the Congregationalist church of Granville. Mr. Harris came into the neighborhood on Saturday evening, and put up with Mr. Whitehead, who fed his horse with green wheat, cut for that purpose. From this it is in ferred that it was during the last days of June. Mr. Green was to preach at Mr. Beem's cabin the next day (Sabbath), and Mr. Harris went with Mr. Whitehead to hear Mr. Green in the forenoon, and in the afternoon preached, himself, in the same house. The second sermon by a Presbyte rian in the township was in June, 1818, on a week day, at the house of Mr. Whitehead, by a Mr. Humphrey, a man of small stature, sent out as a missionary by the Connecticut Missionary society, who afterward settled on the Western Reserve _ Other denominations sometimes held meetings in the settlements. Thomas Birch, a Methodist ex horter, held religious meetings occasionally; and so did Mr. Avery, an Old-school Baptist. His meetings were sometimes held at the cabin of Mr. Elias Williams, and sometimes at a log school house, which stood on a knoll between Mr. Isaac Whitehead's house and that of Mr. Lewis Condit. In the fall of 1819, Mr. Josiah Ward, who had been an elder in the Presbyterian church in Bloom field, New Jersey, moved with his family into the neighborhood. He loved the worship of God, and could not endure living in a neighbor hood where the Christian's God was not recognized in some public manner. He, therefore, immedi ately proposed to his neighbors that they meet regularly every Sabbath, and have religious ser vices. Accordingly, such a meeting was held in his own cabin, probably the first Sabbath after he occupied it. About ten months after this first meeting, July 28, 1820, Rev. Timothy Harris and Matthew Tay lor met at the house of Elias Williams, and organ ized the Jersey Presbyterian church, with eight members, four male and four female. In 182 1, a hewed log school-house, designed also for public worship for all denominations, was raised as far as the eaves. It was probably not covered and finished in other respects until the fall of 1822, or perhaps 1823, some eighteen months or two years after the logs were put up. It stood in what is now the graveyard. The first resolution passed by this congregation was: \u2014 \"Resolved, That a subscription be opened to procure some thing toward paying Rev. Matthew Taylor for his labors among us.\" One year later, in January, 1823, the congrega tion \u2014 \"Resolved, unanimously, That we emplov Mr. Taylor to preach one-quarter of the time for a year, if we can raise funds sufficient to pay him.\" Similar resolutions were passed in 1824 and 1825. In January, 1827, a committee was appointed \"to wait on Rev. S. S. Miles, of Newark, and learn of him if he can be hired to preach for us; how much and what kind of pay he will take for a certain part of his time.\" The committee's report says: \"Mr. Miles can be hired one-fourth of his"], [495, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 485 time for sixty dollars; one fourth in cash and three-fourths in produce, delivered at Newark.\" The congregation agreed to these terms; and so far as appears, Mr. Miles continued to preach on these terms until the fall of 1829, almost three years. November 4, 1829, Rev. Charles Marsh Putnam preached his first sermon for the Jersey church, in a log school-house on the side hill east of the late- Isaac Whitehead's dwelling house. From the sec ond Sabbath in January, 1830, when they first en tered the log building, designed for schools and preaching, the congregation always had a home. In January, 1833, they began erecting a frame meeting house, as the log school-house was too small to hold the congregation; and by the last of May following, it was so far finished as to be occu pied by the Licking county conference of churches. This building was completed in 1836, and contin ued to be their house of worship until 1856, when a new church was erected. Mr. Putman occupied this church as pastor until the beginning of 1868, when failing health admonished him to cease his labors. By an act of Pataskala presbytery he was then made pastor emeritus. He thus sus tained a nominal connection with the only church to which he ever ministered until his death, which occurred April 17, 1869. He was sixty-seven vears of age, and had been pastor of that church forty years. The house of worship dedicated in 1856, be came too small for the congregation before his death, and some years ago ten feet were added to it at a cost of fifteen or sixteen hundred dollars, so that the church now has a comfortable and com modious house, with an excellent bell and organ. Rev. Andrew Thomas succeeded Mr. Putnam, and was installed November, r86g. The Jersey church, though never large in numbers, has been very efficient in sustaining a Sabbath-school and weekly prayer meeting, and in her contributions to the various benevolent boards sustained by the general assembly of the Presbyterian church. The establishment of the Universalist church dates back to 1824, when the Rev. Mr. Curry preached a few sermons at the house of Michael Beem. A few sermons were delivered at the same place by the Rev. Mr. Rogers in 1825 and 1826. The church was organized in 1829, and Rev. Tru man Strong served it as pastor until 1833. Rev. Henry Jolly was pastor from 1833 t0 1837, when Rev. Truman Strong again took charge and con tinued until 1841. It was during this last pastor ate of Mr. Strong that the church was erected, in 1840, and a Sabbath-school organized in 1841, with Daniel Beem as superintendent. Rev. Mr. Case followed Mr. Strong, his charge beginning in 1842. He was succeeded by T. C. Eaton in 1844; Rev. Mr. Johnson in 1846; William Norton in 1848; Henry Gifford in 1849; Samuel Binns in 1854, and Rev. W. B. Woodbury in 1857. Mr. Woodbury still occupies the pulpit of this church. The membership is about sixty. The Sunday school was organized in 1841, and is yet in a flour ishing condition. Harmony Baptist church was organized Septem ber 27, 1837, by Elders George-DeBolt and Eli Ashbrook, with sixteen members. John Boggs, Samuel and Lewis Wright were elected deacons. Elder John Hill preached occasionally at the house of Mr. Armstrong, from 1830 to 1835. Elders George DeBolt, Eli Ashbrook, James Biggs, Wain Taylor, J. P. Taylor, Samuel Meredith, Mr. Han over and others have supplied the church. They have no regular pastor at present, the pulpit being supplied by Rev. G. N. Tussing, of Columbus. The present church was erected about 1874, and cost six hundred dollars. No Sunday-school is connected with it. The first regular Baptist church was constituted June 2, 1845, by Elder William Smedmer, with twenty-four members. Mr. S. Gorman, a college student from Granville, preached a few sermons in 1838, and he and others officiated occasionally until 1845. They erected a church in 1846.. Elder Smedmer was pastor from 1845 to 1847; followed by Elder Adams in 1847; Elder John Carter in 1861; Elder D. D. Walden and others in 1S63; Elder David Adams in 1864; Rev. Simeon Sigfried in 1866; Elder Griswold in 1869. Some of the principal original members were Abigail Woods, Swayne Williams, Gardner Woods, Mr. and Mrs. Urie Colgrove, and Mr. and Mrs. Cyrus Philbrook. Prior to the erection of the present church edifice, which occurred in 1846, the meetings were."], [496, "486 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. held in the school-house near the site of the church. The church is not strong, numbering something more than twenty members; they have no settled pastor, but services are occasionally held. A Sabbath-school has generally been connected with the church ever since its organization, and at present, a union Sabbath-school is held here, which is largely attended by the children of the various religious societies in this vicinity. John Stover is superintendent. The Catholics commenced religious services in 1837, at the house of Francis Carr in Jersey vil- lage; Rev. Young, of Lancaster, being the officia- ing priest. Services have been continued since that time. The present organization was probably effected about 1844, by Bishop Samuel; some of the earliest members being Roddy Lafferty, Patrick Duian, Daniel Cush, and Thomas and Edmond Hall. The first services were held in the houses of the members, but about 1855, the society erected a hewed log building, in which worship was continued until 1875, when the present large frame, named St. Joseph's Catholic church, was built at a cost of one thousand dollars, besides a large amount of voluntary labor. Father Clark is\u00bb at present officiating, with a membership of thirty or forty. A Sunday-school has been long connected with the church, with a membership, at present, of thirty or more. In 1 818 Rev. George Callahan, a Methodist, preached at the house of Elijah Meeker, and in the following year a society was organized, with thirteen members. Rev. Abner Goff was the first circuit preacher. The place of meeting was afterward changed to Mr. Green's in Lima township, and the further history of this organization, therefore, pro- perly belongs to that township. The Methodist Episcopal church, located on the Worthington road near the center of this township, was organized in July, 1844, by Revs. John Dillon and Isaac Warnock, at the house of Vachel Dickerson. The first members were Vachel Dickerson and wife, Solomon Wheeler and wife, Mary Albery, and James Banner and wife ; these seven members constituting the organization. Meetings were held at Mr. Dickerson's house, near the present church edifice, which was erected in 1860, and dedicated in 186 1. It cost six hundred and fourteen dollars. A few of the leading minis ters who have served this congregation, are Revs. Joseph Brown, Samuel C. Recker, James Gilruth, James Hooper, Joseph Adair, Joseph Crayton, James B. Finley and Vaughn. The present pastor is Rev. Watson. A Sabbath-school has been kept up during the summer months, ever since the organization of the church, the present membership being about thirty-five. On the twenty-seventh of March, 1853, Rev. S. C. Riker organized another Methodist society in the cabin of S. D. Ball, of twenty members. In r8s5 they erected a church edifice, which they called \"Union Chapel.\" B. T. Carter, William Dennis and W. S. Easton have been class leaders. The present membership is about thirty. The United Brethren church was organized at Burnside's school-house in 1849, by Revs. leffer son Babcock and George Hathaway, with fifteen members. It was called \" Eden.\" They soon erected a log church which they occupied until 1865, when they built a frame, which stands on the line between Jersey and Monroe townships. Rev. Mr. Levingston was the first pastor. When the new building was erected, the church was reorganized by Rev. William McDaniel, with the following as the principal members: Benjamin Green, Benjamin and George \u25a0 Clouse, William Clark, Joseph Smith, Elisha Green and wife, and William Burnsides and wife. The new edifice cost nine hundred dollars. The present pastor is Rev. H. A. Bovey, and the church is in a good, healthy condition, with a membership of sixty-five. The Sunday-school was organized in 1867, and was, for a few years, held only during the summer months, but for the last five years it has been gain ing in strength and interest, and has been con tinued the entire year. The present membership is about seventy-six. A Christian Union society was organized in 1.865, b)' Benjamin Green, after a series of services in the old United Brethren log church. Revs. Benjamin Green and Stevenson have been the principal preachers. Mr. Green is a grandson of the Rev. Benjamin Green who preached at Mr. Beem's house in 1817."], [497, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 487 The present pastor of this church is Rev. R. W. Graham, of Granville, and the society is in a strong, active, healthy condition, with a membership of about one hundred. The Sabbath-school is also well attended, hav- ing a membership of one hundred, with average attendance cf sixty. This school has been in ex istence since the organization of the church, with occasional intervals of rest. It was permanently established, however, about five years ago. CHAPTER LVIII. LIBERTY TOWNSHIP. Organization\u2014 Location \u2014 Early Hunting Ground\u2014 Mounds \u2014 First Settlers and Settlements\u2014 First Township Officers \u2014 Topography \u2014 Villages \u2014 Churches. LIBERTY township was among the last organ- ized and the last in the county to be settled. It was organized in 1827, out of the east half of Monroe. It is generally level or gently rolling, and was originally covered with a dense growth of hard wood timber. Being away from the principal water courses and roads by which the emigrants traveled, probably caused it to be overlooked by the earlier settlers. The soil is clay, but generally fertile and pro duces good crops of everything grown in any part of the county. It is watered by the tributaries of the Raccoon and North fork. It was a most excellent hunting ground in an early day, and remained so longer than other town ships around it, from the fact that the settlements around it drove the game into its dense forests for safety and better range. Wolves, deer, wild tur keys, wild hogs, and other game were in great abun dance. A mound forty feet in diameter at the base and five feet high, situated half a mile north of Brook's Four Corners, seems to be the only visible evidence that the Mound Builders occupied this territory. It is claimed that Rena Knight was the first set tler in this township in 182 1, and built the first cabin. This is probably a mistake. Mr. George Emerson says that his father, Stephen Emerson, with his family, came from Ware township, New Hampshire, settling within the present limits of St. Albans township, in the fall of 1815, that they remained here three years, and in October, 1818, moved into the present limits of Liberty, making them the first settlers in this township. Mr. Em erson and family were alone in this township nearly three years before any others ventured into it, then Rena Knight came (182 1,) and erected the second cabin, and was soon followed by Mr. Sawyer, who became the third settler. George E. Emerson, the son, was the first white child bom within the township limits. In 1827, when the township was organized, but few settlers, in cabins scattered over the township, were within its limits. John Clark and Caleb Brooks were the first justices of the peace; Stephen Emerson, Jesse Payne and John Sawyer, trustees; Joseph Sawyer, treasurer, and William McCamy, clerk. In addition to these officers the following named gentlemen were residents of the township at this time: William Payne, Benjamin B. Knight, Joseph Riger, A. Longwell, Joseph P. Brooks, Abraham Mouser, Solomon Brooks, Jas per Emerson, David Brooks, David Martin, John G. Brooks, Joseph Watkins, Joseph Kelso, Sam uel Wheeler and William C. Adams. These all settled here within a few years preceding the or ganization of the township. The fact that the land was previously owned by non-residents, also had an influence in retarding early settlement. The township is regarded as one of the best grazing sections of the county."], [498, "488 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. It is divided into nine school districts, the cen tral district containing a town house, where elec tions are held and township business transacted. There seems to be a ridge passing across this township from northwest to southeast, covering its central portion, and dividing the waters of North fork and Raccoon fork of Licking. The headwaters of the former are in the northern part of the town ship, the outlet of the. large swamp on the farm of J. P. Decrow, forming a part of Lake fork, a tribu tary of the North fork, and which joins that stream in Washington township. Another small tributary of the Lake fork rises in the vicinity of Brook's corners. The main stream in the southern part is Lob del's run, a tributary of the Raccoon, which passes, with numerous tributaries, across the southwest ern part of the township, through the village of Concord. The headwaters of Brushy fork are in the southeastern part of this township, in the vicin ity of New Way. The Ohio Central railroad passes across its southwestern corner on its way from Granville to Johnstown and Hartford, but there is no station within the limits of the township, and with this ex ception it is not troubled with railroads or tele graphs, and contains no important highways. There are two small villages within its limits \u2014 Concord and New Way. The former contains twelve or fifteen houses, and is located on Lobdel's run, and the latter, a cross-road's place of half a dozen or more houses, is located in the eastern part of the township. There are five churches at present in this town ship, the first religious organization being effected by the Baptists in the village of Concord in 1832. It is called the \"Regular Baptist church of Liberty township,\" to distinguish it from the Free Will Baptist, this society also having an active existence in this town. The Regular Baptist church was organ ized in a school-house by Revs. Owen Owens and David Adams. The original members of this or ganization were David Adams, Isaac Holmes, Elias Willison, Clarrisa Baker, Emily Stackwell, and Martha Manser. The present church edifice was erected in 1843 or 1844, the people generally subscribing for that purpose. The two ministers above mentioned were followed by Elders Carr, Northup, Dickey and Turner. The membership at present is but eighteen. A union Sunday-school is maintained in Con cord, with a present membership of about one hundred. The children of both the Methodist and Free will Baptist churches attend this school, as well as others, and it is well sustained. The Free Will Baptist church, located in Concord, was organized in 1842, by Elders G. W. Baker, J. D. Heath, Oscar Baker, and others. The members of the first organization were, Stephen Emerson, the first settler of the township; T. Blake, C. Knapp, I. Robbins, Mary Blake, Mary Robbins, Anna Knapp, S. Safford, J. Safford and E. Foster. The following have been pastors in this church: G. W. Baker, G. Evens, O. E, Baker, Asa Pierce, K. F. Higgins, Mr. Whittaker, O. J. Moon, A. H. Whittaker, and H. W. Vaughn. This church is comparatively strong in numbers, the membership being about sixty-five, and is in a healthy condition. The children attend the Union Sabbath-school. The third permanent church organization in the township was that of the Universalist, in 1843. This church had quite a number of organizations in the northern and western part of the county about that time. Soon after organization this con gregation erected a church edifice at New Way, which has since been known as the \"New Way\" church. Caleb Brooks, Eli Stockwell, A. Durfey, Lewis Ingelsbe, S. H. Smith, H. C. Woodworth, William Aram, Christian Edelblute, Jacob Lane, David Brooks, B. L. Critchet, A. J. Critchet, Albert Geer, David Stratton, Ira Stratton, N. S. Woodworth, S. G. Decrow, D. M. Brooks, John Carris, Joel Martin, Samuel McDaniel, Henry Rhoney, John Harter, Asa Ward, and D. John son were the original members of this organiza tion. The church, erected by subscription, cost about six hundred dollars. Prior to the organiza tion preaching had been enjoyed several years, the principal preacher being Rev. T. C. Eaton. It was probably through his influence mainly that the organization was effected. Mr. Eaton was suc ceeded in 1844 by Rev. Mr. Jolly. From 1846 to 1850 Rev. S. Gifford had charge of this congrega tion, and he was followed by Revs. Johnson, Em-"], [499, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 489 met and Samuel Binns, who severally occupied the pulpit until 1857. In 1858 Rev. B. W. Wood bery, of Granville, took charge and has continued his ministerial labors up to the present time. This is quite a large active congregation for a country church, numbering sixty-four communicants. The Sunday-school was organized in 1858, and now has a membership of sixty or seventy. The superintendents have been A. S. Jamison, S. R. Sanger and others. The church located near the line of McKean township, known as \"Liberty chapel,\" was organ ized in 1866, by the. consolidation of the Metho dist Episcopal and Wesleyan Methodist churches. Messrs. John Barrick, John Rusler, G. R. Gos nell and others were prominent in organizing this church ; and S. S. Wyeth, Edwin Runnels, D. G. Wyeth, G. K. Wyeth and some others were mem bers of the first organization. Their first meetings were held in the fall of i866, and in r867 they erected the present church edifice, at a cost of three thousand two hundred and fifty dollars. The present membership of this church is about one hundred. What is known as the \"Liberty Sabbath-school\" was organized in this church in 1867, about the time the building was finished, and has been well sustained since that time. There are probably one hundred pupils or more in attendance at this school. William Barrick is superintendent. In 1860 the Methodist Episcopal church of Concord was erected, and dedicated in November of that year by Rev. Uriah Heath. The building is a very substantial one, costing about one thou sand three hundred dollars. The Methodists were probably the first religious society to organ ize in the township, but it is difficult here, as everywhere, to get at the particulars of their early history, as no records were kept for many years.

It was of gigantic proportions, measuring one hundred and eighty three feet in diameter at its base, and when found by the pioneer settlers, was between thirty and forty feet in height. Many hundred wagon loads of stone were removed from it, and used in the construction of the reservoir, in the cellar walls in the neighborhood, and in the villages along the National road, so that at present it will not proba bly average more than eight feet in height. A tolerably well preserved coffin, containing a skele ton, was found in it some years ago, with a quan tity of beads and other trinkets. Other but less authenticated relics are often named in connec tion with this mound. The \"decalogrfe stone\" with some others require verification. This mound is situated on high ground, and was built of un hammered stone of tolerably uniform size and very large. Hon. Isaac Smucker, who is well informed on the subject, says it was the largest stone mound of which he has any knowledge. It"], [500, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 49\u00b0 is also the only one of its class in the township. The earth mound on the plank road between Newark and Jacksontown, on the farm of Mr. Taylor, is one of good size, and much interest attaches to it on account of the very careful and scientific examination given it, a few years ago, by Professor Marsh, of Yale college, and who gave it a very extensive notoriety through \"Silliman's Journal,\" as, well as in a carefully prepared pamph let publication. He found in it ashes, charcoal, flint, a broken pipe made of soft limestone, pieces of a tube of the same material, a string of over one hundred native copper beads, strung on a twisted cord of coarse vegetable fibre; also shell beads, human skeletons, decayed layers of reddish brown powder, layers of burned clay, white chaff, implements of various kinds, lance and arrow heads, six hand axes made of hematite and green stone, a hatchet, a flint chisel, a flint scraper, many bone implements, five needles or bodkins from three to six inches in length, made of the bones of the deer, an implement for moulding pottery, numerous peculiar implements made from the antlers of the deer and elk, a whistle made from the tooth of a young black bear, spoons made of shells, a vessel of coarse pottery, frag ments of a vase, various animal bones, such as the elk, deer, rabbit, wolf, woodchuck and river mussel, and various other things, including seven teen human skeletons, in whole or in part. No bones of domestic animals were found. The ex ploration of the mound was more perfect and thorough than that of any other within the limits of the county, and its yield of arch\u00e6ological treas ure was generous. Mr. G. P. Russell, of Harvard college, with a number of gentlemen of Newark, assisted in this examination, and retained posses sion of some of those valuable mound deposits. This is but a single instance of the richness of this county, archaeologically considered, and shows what treasures are yet in reach of those who would give these mounds a thorough examination. There are also several mounds on the lands of Mr. Parr, in the vicinity of the great stone mound already described; -and one west of the plank road, on the farm of Mr. J. R. Moore, about two miles south of Newark ; also, one nearly a half mile east of the cemetery, a mile north of Jackson- town. These are not remarkable for size, nor pe culiar in any respect; but one on the farm of the late William Bussey, at Fairmount, is remarkable for size, it being one hundred and fifteen feet in diameter at its base, with an altitude, at present, of twenty-five feet. There is also near the banks of the South fork, two miles from Newark, on what is called Cochran's hill, a work or fortification of the Mound Builders. A few acres are enclosed, perhaps between five and ten, by. a bank several feet high, which appears to have been thrown from the inside, the ditch being within the enclosure. Fronting the creek, where the banks are very steep, there is no ditch for a number of rods. So far as the work was con structed, it is an accurate circle. There is also an earth enclosure of low banks, and small extent, on the farm of Mr. Ronan, half a mile south of the foregoing, covering about one acre. It has a good sized 'mound standing in the ditch and bank, thirty feet in diameter and twelve feet high. There is also, on the farm of Mr. J. Sutton, near the northern boundary of the township, a small mound of earth, and also a fort or enclosure of an oblong square, enclosing half an acre or more, whose banks have been plowed over and almost obliterated. It is situated near \"Fort Spring.\" The Indians, it is known, had a camp on the farm owned by Mr. J. R. Moore; and there was also an Indian encampment in a large sugar grove near Hog run, since the property of Mr. Jacob Brownfield, where the Indians often made sugar. \"Big swamp,\" or \"Two lakes,\" some times, also, called by the Indians \" Big lake,\" and \"Little lake,\" or what is now called the Reser voir, was resorted to by the Indians, in consider able numbers, for the purpose of fishing. There was an Indian trail through this township, and along the Reservoir, leading from the mouth of the Wakatomika (near Dresden), crossing the Licking river at or below the mouth of the Bow ling Green run, to King Beaverstown, near Picker ington or Lithopolis, in Fairfield county, about the head-waters of the Hock-Hocking. That the In dians often camped along this trail, in Licking township, is most probable; and it seems also to be"], [501, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 491 a well authenticated fact that the Wyandots, Dela wares and perhaps Shawnees, had more permanent homes here than the foregoing remarks indicate. Little that is entirely reliable, however, in relation to Indian history, anterior to the settlement of the county by the whites, is known to a certainty. The trail above mentioned is doubtless the one followed by Christopher Gist and Andrew Mon tour in 1 75 1. Gist was, probably, the first white man to pass through what is now Licking town ship. His expedition is referred to in another chapter. A strip of land, two and a half miles wide across the southern part of this township, once belonged to what was known as the \"Refugee lands,\" and the remainder to the United States military or army lands. This division and designation is ex plained in another chapter. The military lands, of which about two thirds of this township is com prised, were surveyed pursuant to authority granted by act of Congress, passed June i, 1796. This township, except what belongs to the Refugee tract, on the original survey, was in the tier of townships numbered one, in range twelve. The township was originally well timbered, abounding in the usual variety and extent of forest trees, the oak, walnut, hickory, and sugar being the principal. It is agreeably, and about in equal proportions, diversified with hill and valley ; one third being low, level or flat land of superior fertil ity; another third being gently undulating and the remainder made up of more abrupt and less pro ductive elevations or hills. The South fork of Licking, which forms the west ern boundary of this township; Hog run and its trib utaries; Swamp run and Dutch fork, are its principal streams. The bottom lands along these streams are among the best in the county, the soil being deep, rich, enduring and exceedingly productive. A portion of the Reservoir is in the southern part of this township, and is fully described in an other chapter. The township was organized in 1801, as one of the townships of Fairfield county, and then em braced the whole of the territory (except the Refu gee -tract,) which now constitutes the county of Licking, and perhaps a portion also of what is now Knox county. Thus it continued until 1807, when it was reduced to half the limits of Licking county, by the formation of the township of Gran ville. Subsequently, by the formation of Union township on the west, and of Bowling Green on the east, both in 1808; and of Newark on the north in 1810, and Franklin on the east in 1812, .it was reduced to its present dimensions. The county lines of Fairfield and Perry, which run through the Reservoir, form its southern boundary. The pioneers of this township were Phillip Sut ton, Job Rathbone, John and George Gillespie, who arrived in 1801; Benjamin Green, Richard Pitzer and John Stadden, in 1802; Major An thony Pitzer, Jacob Swisher, Stephen Robinson and perhaps others, in 1803. Judge Brumback contributes to the pioneer pa pers an interesting article on Hog run and the early settlers along that stream. It is freely quoted from. Probably about 1804, the hogs of one John Ward, of Granville township, running at large, in the fall of the year, strayed across the South fork of Licking, and wintered on or near the land since owned by Jeremiah Grove, and along the little creek just south of it. The animals found in the abundant mast ample food. In the ensuing spring the owner discovered his stock, numerically in creased and in good condition, and immediately, it is said, named the stream \"Hog run.\" Richard Green thus accounts for the name. He also states that the settlers often thereafter called Mr. Ward \"Hog Ward.\" Authority, perhaps equally good, exists for say ing, that about the same time the hogs of Isaac Stadden, then residing below Newark, near the Bowling Green, having strayed away were found on the same stream, and that it received its name from that circumstance. This opinion was enter tained by Mrs. Stadden, widow of Isaac Stadden, who died July 3, 1870, in the ninety-first year of her age. Others account for the name on the theory that some one else's hogs multiplied and fattened along the stream, and their owner, with an early settler's natural gratitude for an abundant stock of pork, gave it the same, suggestive if not elegant, name. Certain it is (and perhaps little else regarding the name is certain) that soon after the whites began"], [502, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 492 to settle in the county, the stream received this name. Doubtless the abundance of beech-nuts and acorns, found in the valley at that time, made it a good place for hogs at large. This circum stance alone might have suggested the name to several persons at the same time. The first settlers on Hog run, according to the recollection of Mr. Richard Green, were Phillip Sutton and John Rathbone, who settled on the tributary reaching toward Jacksontown, in the vi cinity of Harvey T Black's residence and lower down. They must have settled in 1800, or not later than 1801. Rathbone settled on land after ward owned by Mr. Black, and Sutton on land afterward owned by James Davis. Of these per sons there is little known except the single fact that they came from Pennsylvania. The records show that during the year 1800 and 1801, a number of conveyances of land were made. Early in 1801, George and John Gillespie settled on the same tributary, and September 21, 1 80 1, George executed a conveyance of two hun dred acres in the southwest corner of the fourth quarter, part of which was afterward owned by James Davis. The Gillespies remained in this vicinity but a few months. In 1799, Benjamin Green and family, consisting of a wife and ten children, all the latter unmarried; and Richard Pitzer, son-in-law of Mr. Green, with his family, came to Marietta from Maryland. In the spring os' 1800, they started for the Licking valley. The women and children under charge of Mr. Pitzer, with eight pack-horses, came up by land, along a trail. They drove through with them several head of cattle. Benjamin Green and his son Richard, with a hired hand, a Mr. John Kelley, manned a large canoe, or barge, in which they con veyed their household goods and other freight by water to the mouth of the Licking, present site of Zanesville. Among this freight were flour from fifteen bushels of wheat, and the running gears of a wagon, probably the first one brought into the county. In August of the same year Isaac Stad den brought in a wagon, probably the second one. With it he moved his family from Northumberland county, Pennsylvania. Mr. Green found it necessary to make two voy ages to Marietta in order to bring up all the goods of the party. From Zanesville to Shawnee run they cut their own road. When they arrived at Bowling Green they found the families of Hughes, Ratliff and that of a man named John Carpenter. Mr. Green thinks these were all the families then within the limits of Licking county. If Jones, Benjamin and the Fords came, as some think, during this year, it was probably at a later period. Messrs. Green and Pitzer located first on Shawnee run, on lands afterwards owned by Rev. P. N. O'Banon, where they resided two years. February 25, 1802, Benjamin Green acquired lands on Hog run, and soon after he and Mr. Pit zer occupied these lands. The land where Green settled was afterward owned by James Davis; and Pitzer located a little lower down, between him and the run on what was afterward known as the lower Beard farm. They were the first settlers on that part of Hog run, after Rathbone, Sutton and the Gillespies. Green bought one hundred and fifty acres for three hundred and fifty dollars, and in two years sold it to Stephen Robinson for nine hundred dollars. He had cleared off thirty acres. After this sale he contracted with Samuel Dick, a large proprietor, who had two thousand eight hundred acres of land lying on both sides of Hog run, and west of the road from Newark to Jack sontown. He located at the spring, on this land, on that part afterward owned by Jesse R. and Jo seph J. Moore, near where a small, old brick house now stands, north of the residence of John Brum back. This spring, or rather collection of springs, forming a little swamp, was well known. Richard Green says that he, on different occasions after 1804, saw Shawnee Indians encamped in the tim ber near to and south of the springs, and between these and the house of John Brumback. At one time he saw thirty encamped there, who came from Raccoon town, near Johnstown. The Greens must have settled here before 1805, and here Benjamin Green lived until the death of his wife in 1822, when he went to reside with his son, Daniel Green, near Moscow, Licking county. In 1823 he married Mrs. Martha Lewis, daughter of Theophilus Rees, and widow of David Lewis, and died in 1835, aged seventy-six years. He had a family of fourteen children, some of whom after ward became prominent in the affairs of the coun-"], [503, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 493 ty. Richard, one of the sons, lived in this county seventy-two years, dying April 16, 1872, aged eighty-seven years. Mr. Pitzer died in 1819, on Hog run. In 1802, soon after Green settled on Hog run, Jacob Swisher, a settler from Hardy county, Virginia, located on a one hundred acre tract, now part of the homestead of Mr. Benjamin Green. He had expended all his means in reach ing the country, and, without money or assistance, undertook to open up and pay for his purchase. He erected a \"pole cabin\" near the present residence of Mr. Green. The forest afforded him abundance of game, and the stream a good supply of fish. In after years he used to claim to his wife and daughters, that he was a better cook than they, for while he kept house in his cabin, his corn bread and mush never adhered to the skillet, but came out smooth and unbroken. They in defense always urged that this circumstance was not attributable to the superiority of his cooking, but rather to the fact that he cooked and roasted much fat bear meat and venison, and then made mush or baked pone without washing the skillet thoroughly enough lo get off all the grease. In this solitary way, Mr. Swisher lived several years, when he erected a second cabin of round logs, in dimensions, fourteen by sixteen feet. Into this establishment of two rooms, he, in 1804, in stalled his new wife, Phebe, the daughter of his old neighbor, Benjamin Green. Mr. Swisher earned part, if not all, the price of his one hun dred acres of land (one hundred and seventy-five dollars), by packing salt on horseback from the Scioto salt works, in the vicinity of Chillicothe to his neighborhood. This was before any road had been cut out. One man took two horses, and fol lowed the trail through the woods. Each horse carried four bushels of salt, which cost at the works one dollar and fifty cents per bushel, and sold here at four dollars per bushel. It took five or six days to make the round trip. Several years after ward, or about 1809, the settlers thought them selves fortunate in being able to exchange wheat for salt at Zanesville, bushel for bushel. Mr. Swisher continued to reside on the same tract until his death June 23, 1843, at the age of sixty-four. Hog run pioneers seem to have realized fair prices for produce during those early years. Mr. Green says that during the first two or three years, corn sold for fifty cents per bushel, and pork seven dollars per hundredweight. Wheat was not much raised at first, but when produced in quantities exceeding the wants of the neighborhood, often sold as low as twenty-five cents a bushel. The first two calico dresses Mrs. Swisher purchased, cost her one dollar per yard, but they lasted her many years, even until her daughters grew into woman hood. Colonel John Stadden was one of the earliest settlers of this township. A sketch of this gentle man will be found elsewhere. Mr. Alexander Holden was also an early settler in Licking township. He was a man of more than ordinary capacity and intelligence. He was a justice of the peace several years; commissioner of the county from 1817 to 1820, and from 1824 to 1827, and was also elected to the legislature in 1808. He was a man of meritorious character, generally esteemed, and of much decision and firmness. He died nearly fifty years ago. Major Anthony Pitzer was also an early settler, and rendered valuable military services during the war of 1812. In 1816 he was elected to the office of associate judge, in which capacity he served several years; and in 18 18 and 181 9, was a member of the legislature. He was a man of much force and many excellent qualities, but of limited scholarship and attainments. He was a native of Virginia, and came to Ohio from Allegheny county, Maryland, in 1803, settling on Hog run, where he died May May 14, 1852, aged eighty-six years. Samuel Patterson who was elected to the Ohio senate in 1848, and Nicholas Shaver who col lected the taxes of Licking township from 1820 to 1822, were also pioneers of this township. In 1803 Rev. Asa Shinn, then a very young but promising minister of the Methodist church, was appointed to the Hock-Hocking circuit, then just organized, and which turned out to be one which took him four weeks to travel over. It led him into what are now the counties of Fairfield, Lick ing, Muskingum, Coshoeton, Knox, Delaware and Franklin. There was upon it but one regular ap pointment in this county, and that was at the house \u2014 a good sized double-cabin \u2014 of Mr. Benjamin"], [504, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 494 His parents moved to the vicinity of Clarks burgh, Virginia, when he was yet young, when schools or institutions of learning of any kind were scarce, and educational matters almost wholly neg lected. The little education he possesed was ob tained from reading and from his association with men of improved minds. He became a great favorite, at one time, with the people of Baltimore, and his residence there enabled him to improve his mind and complete a literary work upon which he was engaged, called the \"Plan of Salvation.\" The work evinced a great deal of thought and discrimination, but gave him trouble with his brethren, on account of some peculiar views therein expressed, which some thought sounded like heresy. He afterward pub lished a work on the rectitude of the \"Supreme Being.\" Rev. John Burns spent two years with Mr. Shinn at Allegheny City station, commencing in 1840. He had ample opportunity to know him, and his decided convictions were that he was the best man he ever knew. He was social and com panionable, and in all his intercourse governed by unaffected, natural simplicity of manners. A hearer at a camp meeting at Baltimore, in 1813, thus describes him: \"There he stood, with a rather youthful appearance, pale, calm and self possessed, with a round, full, mellow voice, easily reaching the most distant hearer. He seemed an angel in hu man flesh, come from a higher region on that great occasion to instruct mankind in their highest interests. He was strong in argument, apt and clear in illustration, fervent and impressive in his manner, and the latter half of his discourse was over whelmingly eloquent. He had very little power of imagination \u2014 massive thought made him eloquent.\" He preached in Newark, when on a preaching tour to the west, one or two sermons, as late as 1833. He died January 11, 1853, and was buried in the beautiful cemetery near Pittsburgh, Pennsyl vania. Thus passed away the pioneer preacher of Licking county. The little pioneer church organized by Mr. Shinn on Hog run, in 1804, has maintained its existence to the present day, a period of seventy-six years. The society erected a log church in 18 18, or a year later, near where Mr. Shinn organized it. This was afterward moved to the farm of Rev. Benjamin Green, north of where it stood originally, and was, Green, in the valley of Hog run. Mr. Shinn's ap pointment before reaching this one, was on the Hock-Hocking river, at or near Lancaster; and the next one after it, was at, or near the mouth of the Wakatomika, or a few miles beyond it, at the house of a Mr. Wamsly. Mr. Shinn continued his labors a year, begin ning late in 1803, and ending in the autumn of 1804. This organization at the house of Mr. Green was, doubtless, the pioneer religious society of Licking county. Mr. Green was a Baptist, and until near the close of his life, occasionally exercised the functions of a minister of that denomination, and might prop erly be ranked with the pioneer preachers of Lick ing county. He was tolerant of all religions, and as his wife and children were disposed to cherish the Methodist faith, he gave support and encour agement to Mr. Shinn's enterprise. The following are some, and perhaps nearly all, the church members, and those who became such during Mr. Shinn's ministry: Richard Pitzer, Mrs. Pitzer, Jocob Swisher, Mrs. Swisher, John Stadden, Mrs. Stadden, Sarah Green and Mrs. Green, wife of Benjamin Green. It was rather a family church, the male members being sons-in-law of Mr. Green, and the female members his wife and daughters. The great promise of Mr. Shinn's early career as a pioneer preacher in the west was fully realized on reaching the full maturity of his intellect, for he became eminent as an author, no less than as a divine. Hon. Isaac Smucker gives it as his judg ment that no man of better intelleet or of a higher order of pulpit talent, ever exercised the functions of a minister of the gospel in this county. He was born in New Jersey, May 3, His par ents were Quakers, and the boy did not enjoy any educational privileges. He had natural ability, however, and while yet in his \"teens\" attracted attention as an exhorter. Without making any application for \"a license to preach, he was urged to this calling by a presiding elder of the Methodist church, who procured for him a license, and before he was twenty-one years of age was employed as a traveling preacher. He received his first appointment in 1801, and contin ued in the itinerancy of the Methodist Episcopal church more than twenty-seven years."], [505, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 495 twenty-seven years ago, succeeded by a frame build ing, which stands on the farm of Mr. Anthony Pit zer, about two miles from where the original church was erected. The pulpit of the church has been occupied with a good degree of regularity ever since its organization; but its membership is, at present, rather limited. The following are the names of the preachers who succeeded Mr. Shinn until the year 1810, as shown by the conference minutes: Revs. James Quinn and John Meeks, from 1804 to 1805; James Quinn and Joseph Wil liams, from 1805 to 1806; John Meeks and James Axley, from 1806 to 1807; Joseph Hays and James King, from 1807 to t8o8; Ralph Lotspeitch and Isaac Quinn, from 1808 to 1809; Benjamin Lakin, John Manly and John Johnson, from 1809 to 1810. More than sixty years ago the Revs. James B. Finley and C. Springer, the latter of whom is au thority for this statement, held a quarterly meeting in this church. They reached it from the Musk ingum region, by way of a blind bridle-path, which led them mostly through the woods, a little south of Flint ridge. It is probable that this meeting was held at the time of the dedication of the first church edifice, though not certain. Revs. Noah Fidler, Jesse Stoneman, and Levi Shinn, brother of Asa, were also pioneer preachers here. The Christian Union church, a few years ago, organized a society within the bounds of this pio neer Methodist church, whose members were, for the most part, formerly Methodists, and members of the Hog Run church. The two societies occu py, jointly, the church edifice, and are of nearly equal strength in membership, neither, probably, numbering more than a score, or thereabouts. The Friendship, or, as it is commonly called, \"The Hog Run Baptist church\" (Old School) is one of the pioneer churches of Licking township, and of the county. It has had a career of more than sixty-nine years, and has always exerted a de gree of influence second to but few churches in the county. Its positive creed, the free, full, outspoken profession of its doctrines, and the unreserved declaration of their belief by its adherents, their readiness to defend the faith they cherish, and the avowal and prompt- support by arguments of their somewhat peculiar views as to faith and ecclesiasti- cal usages, have all tended to attract public atten tion. The foregoing considerations, together with the wealth they represent, their numbers, their long history and identification with pioneer times, and other causes, have contributed to make this church a power \u2014 a church vigorous, widely known, and of considerable influence. The membership of this church has generally been considerable, and crowds usually attend its ministrations. In 1818, sixty-two years ago, they erected a church which they con tinued to occupy forty-two years. It was of hewed logs, with a gallery running around three sides of it, and more than a third of a century ago Rev. George Debolt occupied its pulpit. In 1860 it was superceded by a good frame building, which is yet occupied. It is of good size and stands on or near the site of the original one, near Van Burenton, where the plank road crosses the northeasterly branch of Hog run. Rev. John W. Patterson was the first preacher in this church. The member ship is now half a hundred or more. The Friendship church was organized February 20, 181 1, by Rev. Thomas Powell and Rev. John W. Patterson. The following persons w-ere the original members: Samuel Meredith, John Simp son, Sarah Patterson, Elizabeth Meredith, Mary Sutton, John W. Patterson, Thomas Deweese, Ann Simpson, and Thomas Powell. Rev. Mr. Patter son was pastor of this church about a dozen years or more after its organization, and was succeeded by Rev. Eli Ashbrook, Elder Hill, Rev. George Debolt, Rev. Christopher Coffman, Rev. Joshua Breese, Rev. John Parker, Rev. Matthew Brown, Rev. S. Meredith, Rev. C. McClellan, Rev. Zach ariah Thomas, and Rev. Benjamin Lampton. This society also own a church near Linnville, erected in 1S48. The denominations known as the Methodists and United Brethren, have each a frame church at Jacksontown. They are not large, hut may be re garded as prosperous. Each of them is a preach ing appointment on a circuit, and its pulpit is mainly supplied by \"itinerants,\" according to the usages of these denominations respectively. The edifice occupied by the Methodist society is neat in appearance and respectable in proportions, and was erected forty years ago or more. That of the United Brethren was originally built by another"], [506, "496 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. denomination, and purchased and repaired by its present owners. The membership of the Meth odist church is sixty or more, with a Sabbath-school of nearly a hundred pupils. The number of members of the United Breth ren church is not large, but the Sabbath-school is strong in numbers and in a flourishing condition. The Fairmount Presbyterian church was organ ized March 24, 1834, by Rev. Jonathan Cable, assisted by Rev. W. Wylie and Rev. Jacob Little. The original members were Harvey R. Gilmore, Dr. Joseph Mathers, Samuel Dobbins, Charles Wallace, Mrs. Wallace, James Hamilton, Mrs. Hamilton, Sarah Smith, Harriet Smith, William Bounds, Rebecca Cunningham and Lucy Gil more. Rev. Jonathan Cable was the first pastor, and served from 1834 to 1838. Their ministers were Rev. Ebenezer Buckingham, from 1838 to 1839; C. N. Ransom, 1840 to 1846; N. C. Coffin, 1846 to 1851; N. C. McBride, 1851 to 1856; D. H. Coyner, 1856 to 1857; N. C. McBride, 1857 to 1869. The membership is more than half a hundred, and a large and active Sabbath-school is connected with the church. The original elders were Dr. Mather, A. D. Caldwell, Charles Wallace and H. R. Gilmore. The church building is of fair proportions, and was erected in 1835. It occupies a beautiful ele vation (Fairmount,) on the eastern borders of the township, in full view of the National road, near Amsterdam, and in the vicinity of a large mound and numerous other works of the Mound Builders. Mr. Richard Green, whose residence in this township dates back to 1802, is authority for the information that a Mr. Taylor taught the first school in the township, in the Green settlement, about the year 1806. Educational interests have continued to receive a fair share of patronage and fostering care of the people of the township, which is now divided into eight districts, most of them being provided with a good school-house. The Ohio canal, along the western boundary of the township, and the National road, running through it from east to west, both constructed about fifty years ago, the former by the State, and the latter by the general Government, very largely contributed to the convenience of the people of this township, and greatly promoted their material prosperity. The National road runs through Licking township from east to west. The work of its survey, location, grubbing, grading and macad amizing was accomplished during the interval be tween the years 1825 and 1835. In one of the earlier years of this period, Mr. Thomas Harris, as proprietor of tire land, laid out the village of Jacksontown and named it after General Jackson, the hero of New Orleans, who was the successful candidate in 1828, as well as in 1832, for the presidency. Mr. Harris was a zeal ous Jacksonian, especially in the campaign . of 1828. His town started off at a lively pace, and soon became a post town of fair promise, but it never attained to a population much greater than at present \u2014 something less than three hundred. VanBurenton is a small village on Hog run, in this township, four miles south of Newark. Avondale is merely a railroad station on the Res ervoir, the only building being the \"Avondale house.\" It is a pleasure resort for Newark people and others in this vicinity, who go there to fish during the fishing and boating season. It is a de lightful place for a day's rest and recreation. Isaac Stadden was the first justice of the peace in this township, while it was yet a part of Fairfield county. He was elected in January, 1802, at an election held at the cabin of Elias Hughes, on the Bowling Green, Hughes being at the same time and place elected captain of militia. John War den became justice of ihe peace a year or two later; and Abraham Wright was next in order, and was in office in 1806, and probably some years earlier. Alexander Holden was among the early magis trates, and was frequently re-elected. Samuel Hupp, Elijah Sutton, John Green, Matthew Black, Herman Caffry, Eldad Cooley, Richard Stadden, John Brumback, Samuel Patterson, Isaac Green, James Pitzer, Thomas Ewing, James Stew art, Jesse R. Moore, B. D. Sanford, Martin Dins more, Thomas Germain, John T. Armstrong, John Woolard, Elias Padgett, F. M. Layton, and Oliver Davis were also among the justices of this town ship, serving pretty nearly in the order in which they are named. Among the early settlers in this township, in ad dition to those named, were Isaac, Jehu, and Jo-"], [507, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 497 seph Sutton, Michael and Adam Kite, Samuel Davis Nicholas Shaver, James Evans, John and Martin Grove, Anthony Geiger, Samuel Moore, John Brumback, Thomas Beard, Thomas Harris, Sam uel Parr, Samuel Hupp, Joseph Kelso, Job Rath bone, George Orr, John Hughes, Willis Lake, Derrick Crusen, Samuel Meredith and others. Samuel Musselman, one of the pioneers of this township, is yet (1880) living, at the age of ninety five. Politically, the township is largely Democratic. CHAPTER LX. LIMA TOWNSHIP.

THIS is one of the finest townships of land in the county \u2014 every acre of it being tillable, and of the best quality, consequently the farmers are generally in good circumstances, are free, indepen dent and prosperous. In its primitive condition, it was a densely wood ed country, there being, probably, upon the advent of the first settlers, no spot of land within its limits sufficiently clear of timber to admit the building of a cabin. The pioneers had literally to hew their homes out of the solid unbroken forest. The tim ber was all hard wood, such as grows upon the best lands of the State; very little, if any, pine, hem lock or other soft wood being found. It is well watered by the South fork of Licking and its branches; that stream having its rise partly in this township. The Clear fork and Muddy fork of this stream pass across the township in a southeast direction, uniting their waters just below Pataskala. The difference in the waters of these two streams indicates very clearly the difference in Ihe soil through which they pass. The Clear fork, as its name indicates, is a clear, sparkling stream, its waters tumbling down over a bed of gravel and stone. It drains the northern and eastern part of the township, made up of high lands. The Mud dy fork, on the other hand, as its name also indi cates, is sluggish, and its waters dark; indicating that they flow through a rich, dark, loamy soil. This stream passes nearly through the center of the township, from northwest to southeast, and, w-ith its tributaries, drains the larger part of the township. A ridge of higher land passes north east and southwest across the southwestern part of the township, upon which is located what is called the \"Summit\" \u2014 a station on the Central Ohio road, and the highest point of land between New ark and Columbus. This ridge divides the waters of the Muddy fork from those of the Black Lick creek, which travel to the Big walnut and thence to the Scioto. The Central Ohio railroad passes in nearly an east and west bee-line across the southern central part of the township, and has three stations- - Pataskala, Columbia and Summit \u2014 within its lim its. Over its single track now pass about sixty trains every twenty-four hours, or a train and a fraction every half-hour; the track being used by both the Baltimore & Ohio, and the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati & St. Louis railroads, between Newark and Columbus. Probably the first mud-road that entered this"], [508, "498 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. failed him entirely, and he asked Mr. Butler to fin ish the reading. The latter read until he came to the place where they were to be pronounced \"hus band and wife,\" when he informed the 'squire that he must do that, as the laws of the State had not conferred that authority upon him. It was done in due form by Esquire Randall. Mrs. Richard Conine stated before her death \u2014 which occurred October 7, 1875, when in her ninety-third year \u2014 that she and her husband, with David Vandeburg, Henry Cooper, and some others, visited this place in 1805, arriving about nine p. m., and finding David Herron and Mr. Hatfield neighbors. The latter lived within the present limits of Harrison township. When within four or five miles of their resting place for the night, Cooper, in order to cheer the drooping spirits of the company, gave a howl in imitation of a wolf. To their surprise, and no little consterna tion, he was answered by what appeared to be half a dozen of the real animals, at no great distance from them. The night was very dark, and, from the old fortifications near Newark, they had no road but an Indian trail. In their hurry to get through, Mrs. Conine's horse stumbled, the girth of the saddle broke and she was thrown to the ground. The gallant gentlemen soon replaced her in her saddle, and all arrived safely. During the first year of David Herron's resi dence here he killed the only panther that was ever killed in this part of the county, about one and a half miles north of the site of Pataskala, in a ra vine directly west of Mr. Hiram Angevine's resi dence. A few Indians were occasionally seen by the first settlers ; they were quite friendly. One day an old warrior called at the cabin of David Her ron. Finding Mrs. Herron alone he thought to test her courage by telling her, by signs and broken English, that some day he would watch for Mr. Herron as he was going alone through the woods and shoot him; then he could come and carry away what he chose and take her along and make her his squaw. So far from frightening Mrs. Herron, it only aroused her indignation and wrath; she sprang to her knife-box, seized a large butcher knife, and charged on the old savage, with ven geance in her eyes. The Indian beat a hasty re- township was the old \"Mud pike\" from Newark to Columbus, via Granville. It enters the township a short distance north of Pataskala, crossing in a southwesterly direction. Over this road the larger part of the first settlers came. They were from Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and, in minor pro portions, from Virginia. They were hunters and backwoodsmen, and buried themselves in the depths of these great, dark woods, with wolves, bears, panthers and other wild animals, and Indians as neighbors. Little is known regarding the Indian occupation of this township, though within the memory of the white man there were no permanent Indian camps within its limits. As a hunting ground it could not be excelled, and was, no doubt, exten sively used for that purpose by the Shawnees en camped in Licking valley, and those occupying Raccoon town in the present township of Monroe. The first white man known to have settled in Lima township was David Herron. He came in r8o5 from Pennsylvania, as is supposed, and built his cabin on the east bank of Clear creek, about one-fourth of a mile north of the site of the village of Pataskala, on land then owned by the father of the late Richard Conine. His brother John came the following year (1806), and remained here, raising a family of nine children, two sons and seven daughters. Henry Richmond and Amariah Cubberly were the next settlers in Lima. Their cabin was on the ground now occupied by the steam flouring mill in the village of Pataskala. In this cabin was taught the first school, in which the children of both Lima and Harrison were first instructed. Miss Cubberly was the teacher. Mrs. Eliza Baird was a pupil in that school. In this cabin, also, was per formed the first marriage ceremony in the town ship. The parties were young Richmond and Miss Cubberly, the teacher. Ministers of the gospel were scarce in those days and civil officers not numerous. Esquire Levin Randall performed this ceremony, and it being the first time he had at tempted such service, he was much agitated and disconcerted. A gentleman^ familiarly called Dea con Butler, was present, and seeing the agitation of Mr. Randall as he was reading the ceremony, stepped to his side. The 'squire's sight soon"], [509, "HISTORY FO LICKING COUNTY. 499 treat, and afterward, when relating the incident, acknowledged that in all his perils he was never more thoroughly frightened than when this pio neer woman went at him with that knife. From the time of the settlement of the Her rons, Richmonds, Cubberlys, etc., down to 1821, but few settlements were made in what has since become Lima township. Richard Conine became a settler in 1821, and was one of the most important and influential among them. He caused a grist-mill, probably the first in the township, to be erected on his land. He engaged a man by the name of Hans Reich ter, better known as John Judge, to dig the mill race, giving him, as compensation, one hundred acres of land, now worth one hundred dollars per acre. Mr. Conine was a man of much public spirit and enterprise. He assisted in erecting log school-houses in every direction around him, and when the age of these institutions passed away, was just as ready with his purse and influence to assist in building those of a better class. He was equally ready in the work of erecting churches, giving largely of his means to several in his neighborhood. When he located upon his farm, but four free holders were in Lima township. These were, be sides himself, John Herron, James Pressley and John Armstrong. There were three leasers, Henry Richmond, Charles Arnold and Joseph Vandorn. The last named was a brother-in-law of Mr. Co nine, and came from New Jersey in 18 18. He erected his cabin where the saw-mill now stands, at the south end of the village of Pataskala. In 1822, there came into this township Jacob Conine, brother of Richard Conine, Andrew and Benjamin Beem, Isaac Tharp, from Hampshire county, Virginia, and Richard Green. Tharp set tled on Hog run in 1815. Soon after, these were joined by Enos Loomis, Peter Wolcott and Eleazer Wolcott. More settlements were made between 1830 and 1840, in this township, than in any other decade since its first settlement. This township was organized in 1827. The first plat for a village was made on the line of the Central Ohio railroad, about one and one-fourth miles from the east line of the township. The proprietor, Mr. John Reese, laid it out about 1850, and gave it the name of Columbia Center. The town soon had in it a post office, two or three dry goods stores, a grocery, two \"taverns,\" a school house, two churches, and a commodious brick building for school, purposes. The two churches are now occupied by the Christian Union and Congregational societies. The town does not, at present, amount to much, containing something more than one hundred inhabitants. Samuel Bes see keeps a grocery in his warehouse. There was considerable strife between Columbia and Patas kala as to which should become the town; both having their origin at the time of the advent of the railroad, about 1850. Reese was an enterprising Welshman, and desired to make his fortune by building up a town. He first tried to buy some land for that purpose of Mr. Conine, who owned all the country about the site of Pataskala, but that gentleman refused to sell, probably for the reason that he had, himself, concluded to lay out a town. Mr. Reese was not to be so easily thwarted in his ambitious schemes, and went a little further up the creek, purchased twenty acres outside of the Conine tract, and laid out his town. Mr. Conine did not get ready to lay out his town until about a year after; Pataskala being laid out in 185 1. He first called it Conine, but the town has generally gone by the former name, and as such appears on the maps, this name being given to the Licking river by the Indians. It was laid out near the east line of the township, just before the railroad began operations. Richard Conine made the first plat, but J. F. Conine and Jesse Green made large and important additions. John Joseph, also, purchased twenty acres north of the railroad and laid it out in lots. The first house erected in the place was a frame dwelling by Alonzo Palmer; his widow yet occupies it. Ephraim Munsell came from Alexandria, built a small store-room, and started the first store. The store-room is yet standing, opposite the Presby terian church. The first post office was established at his store, and he was the first postmaster, re taining the office about three years, when it was taken by the present postmaster, Mr. W. C. El liott, who retained it from that time to this. Upon the arrival of the railroad, it was necessary to es-"], [510, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 5\u00b0\u00b0 tablish a telegraph office, either at Pataskala or Columbia Center, and there was a strife between them as to which should get it. As Mr. Elliott offered a room free of rent for that purpose, Patas kala received the office and has retained it. John Stout was the first operator. The town grew and prospered, soon outstripping its rival, and is now a place of six hundred and thirty-four inhabitants, by the census of 1880. It contains four large stores, each carrying a general assortment of goods, namely, Mead & Youmans, Baird Brothers, Miner Hildreth and Dean Ashbrook. Thomas Hunt keeps a hardware store and J. W. Burnside, drugs and a meat market. There are, besides, a shoe store, a hotel, and the usual proportion of shops and people enaged in mechanical pursuits. A large, two-story brick school-house has taken the place of the old one before mentioned; in it all the children of the town of school age are gathered, to the number of one hundred and fifty, under charge of five teachers (including princi pal); the school being graded according to the law of 1852. Immediately in rear of this school-house was, in early days, an extensive swamp, in which were discovered, some years ago, the remains of a mammoth. A tusk was measured by Rev. T. W. Howe, and found to be five feet six inches in length. The swamp is no longer in existence, having dried up, and been, to some extent, filled to a level with the surrounding land. The mill erected by Mr. Conine on his land near the site of Pataskala, was one of the most important and useful improvements in that part of the county; for many years it did the grinding for a large region of country, and is yet in operation, being now run by steam. A saw-mill is attached. Columbia Center has a steam saw-mill doing a good business, being conducted by the Meiler heirs. Many saw-mills sprang up along the Muddy and Clear forks in an early day. One was located on the latter stream, on land now owned by R. B. Pear son, and two others were below that \u2014 one known as Moon's mill and the other belonged to Alban Warthen, a prominent man in the township, a pol itician, and at one time a member of the legisla ture. These saw-mills have long since disappeared, as the timber in the neighborhood has rapidly disappeared. The days of those old country saw mills, with their great water wheels and their heavy up and down saws, set in cumbersome wooden frames, are numbered. They will disappear as will the rail fences and other evidences of the good old \"wooden age.\" The third town in this township can scarcely be called a town. The Summit, before referred to, contains only a station-house, store, and a few dwellings. The Presbyterians were among the earliest to organize for worship in this township. Rev. Tim othy W. Howe, yet living in Pataskala, gives the following interesting history of this church: \"In July, 1837, a protracted meeting was held in Mr. Joseph Baird's barn, in Harrison township, conducted by Revs. Henry Little and Jonathan Cable. At this meeting quite a large number were hopefully converted, and, on the eleventh of No vember following, a Presbyterian church was or ganized at the log school-house in Lima, near Mr. Samuel Davies Alward's, by Revs. C. M. Putnam, Jacob Tuttle, Jacob Little, and Jonathan Cable. Nineteen persons united in the organization \u2014 ten females and nine males.\" The names of these original members are as fol lows: William Baird and wife, Hall Robertson and wife, Samuel S. Dobbin and wife, Isaac Condit and wife, Joseph Baird and wife, Peabody Atkin son, Mrs. Hannah Van Dorn and daughter Sarah, Julia Knowles, John Frazier, William C. Condit, Mrs. Niblow, and Orson Smith and wife. \"The church was named the South Fork Presby terian church, embracing a territory about ten miles long, from east to west and four or five wide. S. S. Dobbin was elected and ordained an elder in the infant church. Mr. Putnam alone remained over the Sabbath, and administered the Lord's sup per after preaching a sermon. During tbe follow ing year there was only occasional preaching, and that sometimes at Kirkersville, in a school-house, at the northwest corner of the village, and some times near Mr. Alward's in the log school-house in Lima. \"In the summer of 1838, Rev. Hugh Carlisle preached a few Sabbaths for them, and in June of that, year Rev. Francis Bartlett spent a Sabbath in Kirkersville, and preached."], [511, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 5\u00b0i \"October 14, 1838, Rev. T. W. Howe began his labors in the South Fork church. No house of worship was owned by the Presbyterians at that time. Only one family connected with the Pres byterian church at that time lived in a frame house ; the others lived in log cabins. The meetings were held the first year in the Methodist Episcopal church in Etna ; in the frame school-house in Kirkersville, and in the log school-house near Mr. S. D. Alward's. After the first year in Etna, Pres byterians occupied the house built by the United Brethren, as the Presbyterians had assisted them in building it. For eleven years it was thus occu pied every other Sabbath in the afternoon. \"In Lima township we continued to worship in a school-house; and one summer (1849) we occu pied the upper story of the Conine grist-mill, be fore it was finished. Not until 1852 was the house in the beautiful grove, at the gravel bank, so far completed that we could meet in it for public worship. This house cost about eight hundred dollars, and 'was occupied about sixteen years, or until the fall of 1868, when the roof had so far failed that it became unsafe to meet under it ; and the congregation determined to build anew in Pa taskala, rather than repair the old one. \"When the congregation had resolved to build, the Methodist church kindly, and unsolicited, invi ted us to occupy their house until the new one could be erected. This invitation was thankfully accepted, and as we wished to use it but once in two weeks it fully met our wants. In February, 1869, Jesse Horn, Timothy H. Cooley, and Joseph Atkinson were appointed a building committee, and discharged their duly faithfully. They pur chased of Mr. Jacob Joseph a lot for six hundred and fifty dollars. Mr. Joseph generously taking six hundred dollars. The building was to be of brick, forty by sixty feet, and the estimated cost five thousand dollars. A subscription paper was circulated in the congregation, and the pas tor visited Granville, where he was kindly received, and obtained from the good people one hundred and forty-five dollars for this object. Samuel S. Dob bin, the first elder of this church, who has for the last seventeen years been living in Illinois, also assisted us in this important crisis to the amount of one hundred dollars. Our sister congregation in Jersey also gave a helping hand. Six hundred dollars were given as a grant from the Presbyterian church erection committee to be paid when that sum would pay the last dollar due for the building. That sum was paid and the congregation worship ped in their new house the first Sabbath in Sep tember, 1870. The building and lot cost not far from seven thousand dallars. \"October 13, 1870, the church was dedicated to God with appropriate services. Rev. Daniel Tenny, of Newark, preached the sermon from Haggai, 2: 9. 'The glory of this latter house shall be greater than the former.' \"In April, 1867, a request was sent to the Pres bytery to change the name of the church to 'Patas kala.' This was granted. \"In 1852 that portion of the church living most convenient to Kirkersville began to feel that they ought to have a separate organization at that place, and in October of that year forty-four members received letters and formed the first Presbyterian church of Kirkersville. In the same year a Con gregational church was organized in Columbia Cen ter, and eight more received letters from the South Fork church to unite in Columbia. By our record, I see that the church received into its communion from January, 1839, to January, 1852, one hundred and eighty members. By deaths and removals, otherwise than to form the aforesaid churches, the South Fork church had but about seventy, or sev enty-five members remaining.\" The day on which this church was dedicated (October 13, 1870) Rev. T. W. Howe completed his thirty-second year of service in this congrega tion. Of those who united in the organization of this church, in November, 1837, only two remain connected with it at the present time, viz., Mr. William Baird and Mrs. Margery Baird. widow of the late Joseph Baird; the others have departed for the \"shadow land.\" The present membership of this church is something over two hundred. Mr. Howe continued preaching for it thirty-seven years, but in 1876, his health compelled him to withdraw from his labors. A Sunday-school had generally been sustained in this church during the summer season, but owing to the sparseness of the population in the early days of its history, a union school was formed and all met at the 22"], [512, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 502 Methodist church. This union took place in the spring of 1868, but the number soon began to in crease until it reached one hundred and eighty-five, more than could be conveniently accommodated in the Methodist church, so that when the Presby terian building was erected the school was divided; both are, however, working harmoniously. The Presbyterian school is large and flourishing, the average attendance being about one hundred and sixty. Beside the Presbyterian there are two churches in Pataskala \u2014 the Methodist/and United Brethren. The former is the second Methodist church organi zation in the township, and emanated from what is known as the \"Lima Methodist church.\" This lat ter church is one of the oldest, if not the oldest, in the township. It was probably organized some years prior to the organization of the Presbyterian. It is yet in a flourishing condition and occupies a good church building located on Muddy fork, a mile or more northwest of the center of the town ship. When the railroad came through, about 1852, a few of its members, who were compelled to travel some distance to church, concluded to organize a second class in Pataskala, then just laid out. The organization was effected in 1853 or 1854 by Rev. Henry Lonnis, with sixteen mem bers, among whom were the following: Daniel Conine and wife, Henry Meade and wife, Jesse S. Green and wife, Thomas Parker and wife, Calvin Dibble and wife, and Luman Dibble, the last of whom was the first class leader. For the first two years their meetings were held in the old frame school-house, but in 1856, the present church edifice was erected. It is frame, about thirty by forty-five feet, plain and comfort able. The present membership is about one hun dred and twenty-five. About the time the church was organized a Sun day-school was also organized, has been kept up since, and is in a flourishing condition. The United Brethren church of Pataskala em anated from a society organized more than forty years ago, about two miles north of Pataskala, and where a church building was erected and services held until 1870, when the church building became unfit for use, and instead of rebuilding at that place, the Christian Union church building in Pataskala was purchased, and the church transferred to this place. The church was reorganized in Pataskala in March, 1870. Prior to the purchase of the Christian Union church, the society met for a short time in the old Wesleyan Methodist church, one of the first churches erected in Pataskala; the Wesleyan Meth odist society having disbanded. Rev. D. Bonebrake was influential in the organization of this church, and D. Rockey and wife, D. Johnson and wife, J. C. Houserand wife, William Rockey and wife, Mrs. Ewing and Mrs Joseph, widow of J. W. Joseph, were the leading members. The present building is a fine substantial brick, the United Brethren hav ing added twenty feet to it upon coming into possession. The membership is about sixty. The Sunday-school was organized about 1873; is live and active, with a membership of sixty or more. The Christian Union society, which erected this United Brethren church, moved to Columbia cen ter, where their organization was continued some years, but the church is not at present in a flour ishing condition. This was, to some extent, a po litical organization, the members having seceded from the Presbyterian church during the war, on account of the Union sentiments of the pastor and the larger part of the congregation. A Congregational church was organized at Co lumbia center in 1852, by Revs. Charles M. Put man and T. W. Howe, the original members being at the time members of Mr. Howe's church in Pataskala. These were S. D. Alward and wife, George Chadwick and wife, Mark Ritchie and wife, Mr. Simmons, Alfred Whitehead and John Reese. They first met in the school-house, but soon built a small church, costing, probably, not over a hundred dollars, which they occupied until 1878, when the present building was erected. Mr. Howe preached for them at first, for some time. This church has, also, declined, and ser vices are not now regularly held. A flourishing union Sunday-school is, however, maintained at Columbia center. On the old \"Mud pike,\" leading from Granville to Columbus, in the western part of the township, on land now owned by S. C. D. Brock, is located the English Lutheran church, or rather, at present, a union church. Rev. Sensabaugh, a Lutheran, was influential in establishing this church. Not"], [513, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. S\u00b03 being able to raise funds by subscription to build the church, he undertook to build it without assist ance, but failing to complete it, the citizens of the neighborhood subscribed sufficient funds for its completion, with the understanding that it was to be free to all denominations; and such it is con sidered at present. A good Sunday-school has been maintained here since the erection of the church in 1875. CHAPTER LXI. MADISON TOWNSHIP.

THE territory included in Madison township is an interesting one, from the fact that the first settlement of the county took place here. Evidences of the \"lost race\" appear here, as in most other townships of the county. Five mounds are yet visible: one on the farm of George A. Wilson; one south of the Licking, on the farm of D. Wilson; one on the Bowling Green, east of Charles Montgomery; a fourth south of the Lick ing, on the Shannon farm; and a fifth on the Bowling Green, near the chapel. These mounds are not remarkable for size, and in no way distin guishable from hundreds of others scattered over the county. This township evidently has an Indian history, but it is, and probably will remain, unwritten. A camp of the Delaware Indians occupied the Bowl ing Green; so much is known, but this is about all. What their numbers were, who their chief, what the number of wigwams, how long they were in camp there, etc., are questions that cannot be answered. It is said to have been called by the Indians, \"John Elliott's Wife's Town.\" The signifi cance or origin of the name is also unknown. Judge Elliott, who had a trading post .there, it is said, was a single man at that time, else it might be inferred that it was named in honor of his wife. The probability is that this Delaware town was considerably less than fifty years old. Christopher Gist, who passed through here in 1751 (an account of which appears in another chapter), does not mention this town in his journal, though he men tions stopping at two other Indian towns just be fore arriving at the Licking, at one of which he was joined by Andrew Montour, the son of a Seneca chief. It is very evident that Gist followed the Indian trail from Wakatomika (Dresden) to King Beaver's town, and in doing so, he must have passed through or near the site of this vil lage. Had the village then been in existence he would very likely have mentioned it. In February, 1773, David Duncan and David Jones (Chaplain Jones) passed through here on this same trail (an account of which appears else where), and Jones, in his diary, speaks of stopping at this Indian village; it is therefore evident that the village was established between the years 1751 and 1773. It still existed about twenty years later, when Judge Elliott went there as an Indian trader. In the narrative of William Dragoo, which appears elsewhere, it will be seen that he remembers pass ing through the Bowling Green prairie, but he says nothing about the Indian village there. This was in 1786. It must, however, have been there at that time, as Judge Elliott is supposed to have been located there some five or six years later; yet in 1792 Captain Samuel Brady with a party of scouts passed through this place, camped on this beautiful prairie and named it Bowling Green, but not a word is said about an Indian village there."], [514, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. S\u00b04 paw and leatherwood. The lands on either side of this valley are of yellow clay, interspersed with shale of the same color,- and were originally cov ered with a dense forest, principally of oak of giant growth. It will be seen that the township possesses a great variety of soil, which yields a bountiful return to the farmer. At various places along the Licking bottom were patches of prairie land, which attracted the first settlers. The Bowling Green was, perhaps, the most extensive of these. It extended a mile or more along the Licking, and in the spring present ed a beautiful appearance, being a green lawn, cov ered with flowers and clumps of bushes, and, later in the season, with a rank growth of grass. Here it was that the first settlers in the county, Elias Flughes and John Ratliff squatted in 1798. They found a farm ready-made to hand \u2014 something very unusual in this country. All they had to do was turn the virgin soil and plant their corn, which they did that year and for several successive years. This was the first corn ever raised by white men within tile limits of the county. A mile or more below Newark, on the western edge of Madison township, was another small prairie, or perhaps more than one, upon which Isaac Stad den settled and raised a crop of corn in 1800. Dr. J. N. Wilson, in his history of Newark town ship, places Isaac Stadden in that township. This is an error. He settled very near the eastern line of that township, but his dwelling, and probably the whole of his possessions, were in Madison. His brother's child, born in 1801, was probably the second born in the township; Henry Hughes, son ot Elias Hughes, being the first, not only in the township but in the county. Henry was born in 1799. Mr. William Barrick, now an old resident of Hanover township, thinks that John Ratliff, jr., was the first white male child born in the Licking valley, and his (Barrick's) sister, Amelia, the first white female child; the latter, however, was born in Muskingum county, near the eastern line of Licking, in 1799. He says John Ratcliff, jr., was a \"chip off the old block,\" a harum-scarum, wild, roving fellow, and very fond of hunting; was al ways seen with a rifle on his shoulder, from boy hood. When he grew up and married he moved It is not likely it was there at that time, as a fierce war was then in progress between the whites and Indians, and it is not likely that Brady and his scouts would have ventured to encamp near an Indian village, even had they been allowed to. The village must therefore have disappeared be fore this time \u2014 probably about the time of St. Clair's defeat or before. From these facts it may be concluded that this Indian village existed from twenty to thirty years. While excavating for a bridge abutment on the east bank of the Bowling Green run, several years ago, seven skeletons of undoubted Indian type were exhumed. This spot was probably the grave yard for this Indian town. One of these skeletons was six feet three inches in length. No depredations were committed by these Indi ans in this part of the country, so far as known. There were no white settlers in their immediate vicinity. No village was in existence on the Bowl ing Green when the first settlers of this county came; thjre were a few Indian camps in the Lick ing and Raccoon valleys, but John Elliott's Wife's Town had disappeared. A small camp of Shawnee Indians also existed on Shawnee run, on or near the farm of P. N. O'Bannon, which circumstance gave name to the run. This township is well watered by the main Licking river, which passes through its center from west to east, and the tributaries of this stream, which flow into it from the north and south. The Central Ohio and Pan Handle railroads, and the Ohio canal pass through the township, following the Licking valley. The soil of the Licking bot toms is rich, warm, sandy loam, and fine gravel, well adapted to all crops, more especially the early crops. There are many indications that this val ley was once a vast lake, the waters of which were held in place by the soft sand rock at Black Hand. The continued attrition of falling water in time wore away the rocks, and the waters of the lake escaped through the chasm, leaving the rich de posit of ages, which in places seems inexhaustible. The timber of this bottom consisted mainly of hard and soft maple, sycamore, black walnut and the inevitable buckeye. Under the wide-spreading branches of these flourished the wild plum, paw-"], [515, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 5\u00b05 west to Illinois. Out there he lived principally by hunting; hauling his wife and family of several children, and his few possessions, about in a wag on, and camping in various places for indefinite periods. He was last seen in this situation on one of the great prairies of Illinois, and had been in that locality about a year, but concluded to move; game was probably getting scarce. One of his oxen had died, but, hitching up the cow beside the other ox, he loaded up his family and effects, and moved away over the horizon-bound prairie, with out road, guide or compass, and disappeared for ever, so far as his friends in Licking county are concerned. This represents one phase of the pioneer character. The cabins of Hughes and Ratliff were erected on the Bowling Green prairie, between Montour's Point and the Licking creek, about half a mile above Bowling Green run. These two families, consisting of twenty-one persons, were the only white inhabitants of this township and county until 1800. In the spring of this year Benjamin Green and Richard Pitzer arrived, and shortly after, John VanBuskirk. In September, Isaac Stad den and family arrived, and, in September, Cap tain Samuel Elliott came, making the seventh family within the limits of the township. The marriage of Colonel John Stadden, and Betsey, daughter of the aforesaid Green, which took place on Christmas day, 1800, made the eighth family, which was the whole number when the year closed. A biographical sketch of each of the above pioneers will be. found in another chapter. The settlers in this township in 1801 were John Larabee, James Maxwell and John Weedman. John Larabee was one of the most remarkable of the first pioneers of Licking. He was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, in 1760, and was of English descent. His father led a seafaring life, and is sup posed to have been impressed into the British ser vice, from which he never returned. John ran away from his uncle, by whom he had been adopted, at the age of fifteen, and entered the United States service at the beginning of the Revolution. He served first as a teamster two years, and then en tered the ranks as a private soldier, carrying a mus ket and faithfully discharging his duty to the end of this great struggle. He participated in many battles, including that of Trenton, at which he had his feet badly frozen. He received an honorable discharge at the close of the war, and during the later years of his life, a pension from the Govern ment, in recognition of his services. But little is known of his whereabouts after the close of the war until the year 1800, when he is found near Marietta, the father of a family. In the spring of 1 80 1, Mr. Larabee, leaving his family behind, em barked with others in a canoe, for the rich bottoms of the Licking, carrying some bacon and other sup plies with them, as a partial subsistence during the summer. A portion of his fellow emigrants came by land, driving the stock, of which Mr. Larabee owned a yoke of oxen and two cows. He landed on the south side of Licking river, nearly opposite the mouth of Bowling Green run, and squatted on land afterward owned by William O'Bannon. Here he found, what was very com mon in those days, a large, hollow sycamore tree, in which he domiciled for several months. It fur nished him a room more than ten feet in diameter, and was amply capacious for all his purposes. He cleared the land, raised a few acres of corn, and at his leisure during the summer built himself a cabin. Maxwell, who came with him, was the first school-teacher and first constable in the county, and a noted singer. Having completed his cabin, and raised his crop, Mr. Larabee returned to Marietta in the fall for his family. These were brought up to their new home, and here they lived a pioneer life for several years. He prospered, and subsequently bought a tract of land of Judge Smith and Thomas Sey mour, a mile or two southwest from his hollow syc amore. Mr, Larabee was wholly illiterate, but honest and industrious, and a member of the Dis ciple church. He died February 6, 1846, aged eighty-six. Mrs. Isaac Stadden, who lived until July 3, 1870, and died in her ninetieth year, was a woman of remark.ible mind and memory, and gave much val uable and interesting history of the early settle ment in this county. She says that her husband came to this county and township in the month of May, 1800, in company with his brother, John, and built a cabin on what has since been called"], [516, "506 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. the Warden, now Jones' farm, near the first canal lock below town. They planted corn just south of their cabin on a prairie, and, after attending to this crop, returned to Northumberland county, Pennsylvania, moving back again in the follow ing September. Their cabin was further west than any other on the Licking; Captain Elliott built near the big spring, on the Davis farm; Richard Pitzer and Benjamin Green, near together on Shawnee run, near where the State road crosses it; Elias Hughes and John Ratliff, who came two years before, also lived near each other, just below Montour's point, near the residence of C. W. Montgomery. She thinks these were all the cab ins then in the territory which now constitutes Lick ing county, but that the Buskirks may have been building theirs up the South fork, as she had no acquaintance with the family for years afterward, and cannot fix the precise time. Soon after moving into their cabin her husband and brother enclosed the prairie where their corn was planted, for the Elliotts had several horses and cattle running out, which they feared would de stroy their crop. The fencing was done partly by brush and partly by rails and poles. One day her husband went out hunting for deer in Cherry valley, discovered the \"Old Fort,\" and came home greatly excited about it, he never having heard of anything like it before. The Mound Builders had not then been heard of among the pioneers, if, indeed, by anybody. The next morning Mrs. Stadden and her husband mounted their horses and rode over to visit this great curiosity ; they rode around it on the em bankment, and were the first white people, so far as known, to visit this ancient work, which has since been visited by wondering thousands. She says that late in November her husband went out one afternoon west of the Old Fort to hunt deer, as he had often done before, this being his favorite hunting ground. He desired to be near Ramp creek very early in the morning, where the deer frequented, that he might kill one before the leaves would get dry, to cause a noise when he was walking through them. He was startled, as he walked through the forest, by the sight of a camp fire, he not being aware of any other settle ment in this section but the one on Licking. He approached the fire, and met John Jones, Benoni Benjamin, Phineas and Freeerick Ford, all broth ers-in-law. Mr. Stadden remained all night with this party, and soon ascertained that Jones and himself had been schoolmates in Northumberland county, Pennsylvania, that they all liked the valley, and had determined to locate there \u2014 they were then on a prospecting tour. These people all re turned with their families late in the winter or early in the spring of 1801, and Jones planted corn in thesame field with her husband and his brother, on the Warden prairie. In 1802 Jacob Nelson became the owner ot a large tract of land upon which he settled, a mile and a half below Newark, in this township. After a few years residence he built a mill, and then sold out. In 1803 John Simpson, Robert Church, William Scammahorn, Richard Jewell, Edward Crouch, William and John Moore, Thomas Seymour, and William O'Banon settled within the present limits of this township. O'Banon became a somewhat prominent citizen. He was a successful farmer and stock-raiser, and became a large land-holder in the county before his death, which occurred in his seventy-third year. Judge O'Banon was one of the early justices of the peac\u00a3 of Madi dison township, and served as associate judge of the common pleas court of this county from 1825 to 1S39, and discharged his judicial duties with fidelity and ability. John Channel, a great hunter, Thomas Deweese and Henry Smith, were pioneers of this township in 1804. They were Virginians. Smith was one of the early magistrates of the township, also asso ciate judge of the common pleas court from 1809 to 1823. John Channel was a somewhat remarkable pio neer, on account of his hunting exploits, a recital of which would make a volume. Some idea may be gleaned of his prowess in this direction by the single statement that he once informed Mr. Thomas Taylor that he killed nine bears one day before noon. These animals were very plenty on the bluffs lining the Licking valley. Channel had been raised among the Indians; was tall, straight as an Indian, black hair and swarthy complexion; indeed, looked and acted more like an Indian"], [517, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 5\u00b07 than a white man. He raised quite a family and his boys were mostly hunters. One of the block-houses erected in this county was in this township. It was on the Bowling Green, near the cabins of Hughes and Ratliff. It was occupied by the few pioneer- families on the Licking, only for a (e\\v days, having been erected immediately upon the return of Hughes, Rat liff, and Bland from their expedition into Knox county after Indians that had stolen their horses, an account of which appears elsewhere. Madison township was organized in 1812. Prior .to the organization, and while it was part of Licking township, Fairfield county, Isaac Stadden, John Warden, and Abraham Wright acted as jus tices of the peace. The former was commissioned in 1802. Probably the first school in this township was taught, or, rather, kept in a cabin that had been built lor a dwelling, which stood on land now owned by George A. Wilson, and a few rods north of the present township house. A Mr. Tunis Cole was the teacher. He was a cooper by trade, and knew little about school teaching. It is related of him that he once undertook to give out the word \"phlegm\" to his spelling class, but after studying over the word sometime, spelling it slowly to him self, he was unable to give it any better pronounci ation than \"pe-lem;\" as the future sovereigns did not understand the pronounciation or the word, they sailed to spell it correctly, and the \"master\" thereupon took his hickory from its place behind the jam, and flogged the entire class. He was notorious for using a very long \"hickory gad,\" and frequently, while using it vigorously over the scholar, it would wrap so far around as to reach his own legs, upon which he would lay it on more furiously than ever. The first school-house \u2014 a hewed log \u2014 was built on the farm now owned by W. R. Seymour. The first mill in the township was erected by J. Nelson, and for many years went by the name of Nelson's mill. It was on the south bank of Licking, on the Rowe farm. It was a log mill at first and erected about 1 8 1 o ; afterwards a frame was put up. Nelson owned one thousand acres of land around this mill, subsequently purchased by Messrs. Brice and Stanbery. Mr. John Hasel now owns the land where the mill stood. The second mill was erected by Judge Llenry Smith in a bend of the Licking, about three miles below Newark. Saw-mills were connected with these mills; they have long since disappeared, as have, also, many other mills erected in an early day in this township. The Licking furnished good water power. The only grist-mill at present within the limits of the township is the Hickey mill, at Clay lick. This town, if it can be called a town, is the only one in the township, and even this is partly in Hanover township. A mill was built there many years ago, and about thirty years ago Evan Stone started a store and succeeded in get ting a post office, which has been retained ever since. The town contains, beside the mill and store, a blacksmith shop and a few dwellings, and is a very pleasant village. The Licking valley of to-day is one of the most beautiful in the State; the farms are well fenced and kept; the farmers are all in comfortable cir cumstances, and one could not conceive of homes more pleasant and happy than those found in this valley. These houses have most of them received appropriate names, such as \"Locust Hill,\" \"Ben well\" (the home of J. A. Taylor, from their na tive town in England), \"Green Wood,\" \"Willow Springs,\" \"Oak Wood,\" \"Pleasant Valley,\" \"Cedar Grove,\" \"Ever Green Farm,\" \"Brooklyn,\" \"Shaw nee Run Farm,\" \"Mound Farm \"(owned by Thomas O'Bannon, having the large mound upon it), \"Lynn Wood\" (farm of the late P. N. O'Bannon), \"Spring Valley,\" \"Deer Lick,\" etc., etc., all going to show a pride in home, and a desire to build up a beauti ful dwelling place. The first preaching in this township, and indeed in the county, was probably at the hut of Samuel Elliott, about a mile east of Newark, by a Presby terian, Rev. McDonald. He preached two ser mons at the time of this visit (1S02), one in the cabin of John Ratliff, near the mouth of Bowling Green run, about four miles below Newark. Half a dozen families, more or less, then occupied the Licking valley, and were all the inhabitants of the county. Mrs. Isaac Stadden remembered these sermons. Rev. McDonald was on his way to Franklinton, and Isaac Stadden accompanied him in the capacity of pilot after leaving here, some ten"], [518, "5o8 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. miles up the South Fork road, the latter being then but an obscure trail. Mr. McDonald carried pis tols for his protection on this journey. He was pre-eminently the pioneer preacher of Licking val ley. This was, probably, Mr. McDonald's first and last visit to this territory. The Methodists were, probably, the first to or ganize a church within the limits of the township, though this did not occur until 1810 or 1811: prior to this, however, many sermons had been preached to the settlers in their cabins. The set tlers in this valley being on the great highway from Zanesville west, were more frequently visited by all sorts of travelers than those of any other part of the county. It is not unlikely that all the early preachers, who necessarily passed through the valley and stopped frequently at the cabins of the settlers, and often held religious services. Among these were the Revs. Asa Shinn and James Quinn, two of the earliest preachers of the Methodist pursua sion. This frequent passing of preachers through the valley and the holding of religious services in the cabins, barns, and open air, probably culmi nated in a determination of the settlers to erect a building for religious purposes. This was accom plished about the date above mentioned (1810 or 181 1), the building being a hewed log structure which stood near the Bowling Green prairie, and on the lot now occupied by the Methodist church. A graveyard was established here very early, and this has always been known as the \"Bowling Green\" church. This log church was built by the settlers, without regard to religious belief, and was consid ered free to all denominations, but the Methodists occupied it most of the time, and from this fact rather claimed to control it, and did control it many years, though it was frequently occupied by other denominations. A preacher by the name of Newell came along in an early day, and held a series of meetings in this church, and organized a New Light society. After their organization the New Lights continued to hold meetings in this church, which, after a time, created some strife between this society and the Methodists, which, in time, very nearly broke up both societies. Fre quently both churches wished to hold services at the same hour, and it was not unusual to see two congregations, one holding services in the building and the other in the church-yard. The New Lights finally withdrew, and were instrumental in estab lishing what is known as \"Union Chapel,\" in the northern part of the township. Among the original members of this Methodist church were William Moody and wile, John Chan nel and wife, Thomas Taylor and wife, William Montgomery and wife, and others, whose names are forgotten. No records of the church have been preserved. Prior to the erection of the church, services were frequently held at the cabins of William Moody and John Channel. Revs. Noah Fidler and James B. Finley were among the earlier preachers to this class. Mr. Thomas Taylor was a leader in the first Methodist church organiztion in Newark. The old log church building was in use about thirty years, but, in 1841 or 184^, the second church building, a frame, was erected, near the old one. The Methodists by this time had secured the ground, and, as this church was built entirely by this society, there was no further strife as to the occupancy. The third, and present church edifice, was erected in 1858 or 1859, cost about twelve hun dred dollars, and is thirty-four by fifty-six feet. The membership reached, at one time, one hun dred and twelve, but, at present, it is not more than forty. The first Sunday-school in this neighborhood was organized about the time the canal was in pro cess of construction. This date is fixed from the fact that during this time the contractors who were building this part of it, having a large contract, and having to build two locks, concluded to estab lish a store for the purpose of supplying their work men. For this purpose they erected a building near Isaac Stadden's dwelling, and, after complet ing the contract, they abandoned the building, moving their store to Newark. In this building a union Sabbath-school was established, and children of all denominations attended, though it was gen erally managed by the Presbyterians. James' Reeder, Mr. O'Bannon, and Philip Seiler were in fluential in establishing it, the first named being the first superintendent. It was kept up here four or five years, when Mr. Stadden secured the building, which he occupied in part for a dwelling. The"], [519, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 5\u00b09 school was then removed to what was known as \"Smith's school-house,\" where it was continued as a union Sunday-school until the Methodists organ ized their Sunday-school in their frame church, about 1845. Andrew Taylor was the first superin tendent of this Methodist school, and it has been kept up during the summer months ever since. It now numbers thirty or forty pupils and teachers. About two miles below Newark, on the valley road, is located a long, low building used as a black smith and wagon shop; the township house and a few dwellings are also near the place, and the peo ple have nicknamed it \"Flammertown.\" At this point what is known as the \"Old Furnace road\" branches off northward in the direction of the old furnace in Mary Ann township. It was cut out in an early day for the purpose of reaching that re nowned furnace. On this road, in the northern central part of the township, is located Union chapel, the church that was established by the New Lights when they could no longer agree with their Methodist brethren on the Bowling Green. Several of the old Methodist church congregation, among whom were William Moody and wife and Mrs. Isaac Stadden, had accepted the new doc trine, and were early members of this organization. They call themselves Bible Christians. The or ganization of this society dates .back to about 18 15, the Rev. Newell, as before stated, assisted by Rev. Britton, were the chief persons in perfect ing it. The New Lights were assisted in building this church by the United Brethren, and by the people generally, and it was called Union chapel, being free to all denominations; however, it was generally occupied by the two above named denominations, and subsequently by the New- Lights alone, as the United Brethren erected a church of their own over the line, in Mary Ann township. It is a hewed log building, and was erected about 1843. It is seldom occupied now for any religious service. A union Sabbath-school was established and kept up some years, but it has been abandoned. The little church located on Clay Lick creek, in the southern and central part of the township, called Madison chapel, is an offshoot from the old Bowling Green church, and was organized about 1830. The church was erected about 1855. Rev- James Hooper was then on the circuit. William Barrick and wife, George Colvin and wife, Z. Win ters and wife (both of whom were killed a few weeks ago by the cars, while crossing the track), Lewis Lake and wife, and a few others, came to the conclusion that the Bowling Green church was a little too far away, and that they were able in that neighborhood to build and support a new church. Mr. Lake gave the ground upon which the building was erected, with the proviso that the society should have it so long as it was used for the purposes of a Methodist church. Other wise, the land was to revert to the original owner or his heirs. At present the congregation is small, numbering not over a dozen members. It has generally* sustained a Sunday-school during the summer. About fifty years ago, just below the site of the above mentioned church, on Clay Lick creek, a Protestant Methodist church was erected. It was a hewed log building, and J. B. W. Haines, Will iam Swern, Lewis Miller, Mr. Montgomery and wite> and some others, were among the original mem bers. Mr. Haines preached for them. When the church became old and unfit for use they erected a new one, about 1S50 or 1855, further south, on a blanch of Clay Lick creek, at Pleasant Ville, a cross-road place, where there is a blacksmith shop and two or three dwellings. This church is pretty well sustained, having now a good congregation as to numbers, and a flourishing Sunday-school. The Christian Union church is located in the western part ot the township, near where the high way crosses Shawnee run. Its organization was the result of political complications during the war, and was made up of those who opposed the war and the abolition of the slaves. Benjamin Green and the Arhertons were leaders in the movement. They held meetings some years in the school-house and township house, but erected a church about 1 87 5. Benjamin Green, Augustine Atherton and his father, John Atherton, W. Shaw, George Gut ridge, and a few others, were the earliest members, and the two first named preached for the congre gation. The church is a small frame, about twenty four by thirty feet. The 'present minister is Rev. Duckworth. The Sabbath-school is in a flourish ing condition."], [520, "CHAPTER LXII. MARY ANN TOWNSHIP.

IF Mound Builders works ever existed to any great extent in this township they have disap peared, with a few unimportant exceptions, though the ground has not been thoroughly examined with a view to the existence of mounds, or to lo cating such as may exist. There is one on what is known as the Fisk farm, a farm formerly owned by Levi Miller. It has been plowed over for years, and is, of course, greatly reduced in height, but is yet about ten feet above the surface of the surrounding field; this field being a level one. It is not exactly cir cular in form. In its primitive condition Mary Ann township presented a wild and rugged appearance, and was the home of every species of wild animal known to the woods of Ohio, as well as venomous rep tiles and other creeping things. It was a paradise for the red and white hunter, and was roamed over by the Indians and white men on hunting ex peditions, long after its first settlement, and after game had largely disappeared from other portions of the county. Its deep, dark ravines, vast thick ets, rocky fastenesses and cavernous hills furnished secure hiding places for wild animals, and they sought shelter in these when driven from the more open country. Mary Ann corners with Newark township on the northeast, and derived its name from a furnace erected within its limits, which will be noticed in its place. No Indian history has been preserved, except the fact that this territory was extensively used by the Indians on the Bowling Green as a hunting ground. Topographically it is broken and hilly and well watered by numerons springs, and by the Rocky fork and its tributaries. Its surface and soil do not differ greatly from Eden, elsewhere described. The entire surface is interspersed with granite boulders, known in rustic vernacular as \"nigger heads.\" The southeast quarter contained consid erable quantities of iron-ore, which was mined and smelted in the old Mary Ann furnace. The soil of the valleys is rich, yielding heavy crops of corn and grass, 'she up-land, which largely predomi nates, is of a thin clay soil, underlaid with clay shale. It yields a superior article of wheat, and is well adapted to all small grains. Coal crops out along the Rocky fork in places, but is not in sufficient quantities to pay the ex pense of mining at present. It is upon the ex treme edge of the great coal fields. The Rocky fork enters the township near its northeastern corner, and running generally south, leaves the township near its southeast corner, in its passage, making a bend toward the center of the township. Its principal tributary is Lost run, which rises in Eden township; its general course being south to Wilkins' corners, where it makes a bend eastward, which direction it keeps until it enters the Rocky fork. These two streams contain clear, sparkling spring water, which tumbles down from among the rocks and hills, and flows swiftly over rocky beds. Numberless smaller streams en ter them from various directions. The scenery along the Rocky fork, in this town ship, is grand, and during certain seasons of the year, very beautiful; the hills approaching young mountains in their ruggedness and altitude. The .earlier settlers of this interesting region were from Virginia."], [521, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 5\" A Mr. Bush emigrated from Hardy county, Vir ginia, in 1809, and built a cabin on the land of Jacob Miller, since owned by Leonel Miller. Bush died in 181 1, leaving a widow, two daugh ters and three sons. The oldest daughter married Lewis Farmer. This was probably the first mar riage in the township. After Bush died the widow removed from the township, and in the spring of 181 2, Hugh Doran, originally from Ireland, but more recently from Frederick county, Virginia, moved into the Bush cabin. In 18T4, Doran completed and moved into a cabin on his own land; and Charles Barnes, who had removed from Frederick county, Virginia, three years pevious, loca ting temporarily in Newark township, removed to the Bush cabin. By fall of the same year Barnes had completed a cabin on his own pur chase, adjoining the Miller tract; and in the spring of 18 1 5, Stephen Giffin came into the Bush cabin ; his son James, father of C. B. Giffin, lo cating one mile northeast of said cabin. Thus it will be observed that all the earliest settlers lived at one time or another in the Bush cabin, the first cabin in the township. The same time that Doran occupied the Bush cabin, James Riley erected a cabin on what is known as the Scotland farm. He was succeeded the next year by Duncan Campbell, a Scotchman from whom the farm received its title. About this time James Thompson, Robert Con cley and James Maxwell located on the school lands in the northeast part of the township. Jacob Benner occupied and raised a field of corn on the Daniel Wilkins farm during the sum mer of 1811. It will be observed that the pioneers came into the township in about the following order: 1809, Bush; 18.11, Doran and Benner; 1812, Riley and Campbell; 1814, Barnes, Thompson, Concley and Maxwell; 1815, Stephen Giffin, sr., Stephen Giffin, jr., James and John Giffin. Fol lowing closely upon the heels of this pioneer band came Jacob Miller, Henry Wilkins, Daniel Wil kins, William Mcllvain, Seth Carver, Nehemiah Harris and William Grey. The death of Bush was probably the first in the township of a white person; he was buried in what was known as Jacob Miller's burying-ground. Charles Barnes died in 1815, and was buried on top of the ridge just west of Wilkins' corners. This spot of ground is now known as the Mary Ann cemetery, and is a beautiful one. It is incor porated under a State law, and receives much care and attention. This township, originally a portion of Madison, was subsequently attached to Newton and then to Newark, and was finally organized as a township in 1817. The first trustees were William Grey, Joseph Moore and James Giffin. The first jus tices were Samuel Stewart and Samuel Davidson. The first clerk was Samuel Stewart, the second, Stephen Giffin. The first constable was Duncan Campbell, of the Scotland farm. One of the pioneers of this township, James Maxwell, was the first constable in Licking county, entering upon the discharge of his duties in 1802, when this county was a township in Fair field county. On one occasion he went on foot to Owl creek (Mt. Vernon) to serve a summons on some delin quent pioneer, who was sued in Esquire Stadden's court; and on his return became lost in the woods, and, night overtaking him, he went into bivouac, near Wilkins' corners. He must have survived the rigorous official duty, however, for as late as 1830 he retained sufficient mental and physical vigor (and it required an abundance of the latter in those days) to teach a county school and \"board round.\" The erection of the Mary Ann furnace was an era in the history of this region deserving of more than a passing notice, as it contributed largely to the developement and settlement of this portion of the county. Iron ore of a superior quality being discovered in the southeast quarter of the township, David Moore, a respected pioneer, and father of a large family, with an energy worthy of the times in which he lived, determined upon the erection of a smelting furnace, and as an initiatory step, erected a saw-mill in 1815. Soon after, he began the erection of a furnace, under the supervision of Stephen Cooper and Lilburn Wilson. Almost simultaneously with this enter prise, Mr. Moore erected a grist-mill. The mill wright, in this case, was the somewhat eccentric,"], [522, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 5\" is all there is left of the Mary Ann furnace. This pile of stone \u2014 mostly cut sand-stone \u2014 has withstood the ravages of fire and time, and stands as a monument of the early days of Mnry Ann. It is probably twenty feet square at the base, and tapers toward the top; the sides are somewhat cracked, much of the top has fallen in and out, giving it the appearance of a venerable ruin. This was the furnace part, and in rear of it, clinging to the bluff was the large wooden building, destroyed by fire. In the history of Ohio appears the following, which goes to show that the rugged hills of Mary Ann had been put to certain uses prior to the ad vent of the first settlers : \"After the organization of Muskingum county, and before the erection of anv public buildings, two men were arrested for counterfeiting silver dollars. It was impracticable to send them to jail at Marietta, a distance of sixty miles through the woods, until the sitting of the next court, to which they were hound over. Under these circumstances, without any law except that which necessity creates, they were given in charge of Mr. Mclntire and Daniel Converse, 'to safely keep till court.' This they voluntarily agreed to do, or suffer the penalty themselves. \"A cabin was selected, the prisoners handcuffed together, and Mclntire thus addressed them: 'Now boys (pointing to the blankets), there is your bed; with your guilt or innocence we have nothing to do; you shall have plenty to eat and drink, but if you attempt to escape, d \u2014 n you, I will kill you.' The firm, resolute manner of the address deterred them from mak ing any attempt. Under the watchful surveilance of these men, who alternately sat by the cabin door, axe in hand, they were safely kept until court, when they were tried and convicted. One confessed his crime, and told where the tools were secreted on the Rocky fork, where they were found and brought into court. The one who confessed, received a sentence of twenty nine lashes, the other thirty-nine, well laved on by Sheriff Bey mer; the culprits immediately afterward departing for parts un known. Robert Concley,\" one of the settlers on the school lands, lived the life of a hermit, and was unfortunately addicted to his cups. The exact circumstances of his death will, perhaps, never be known, as his partially charred remains were found about a rod from the ruins of his cabin. Charles Barnes, one of the pioneers mentioned, had, in his early manhood, penetrated this wild region under Lord Dunmore as far as the Old Chillicothe Indian town on the Scioto, and was present at the celebrated treaty where Logan made the speech familiar to every schoolboy. This campaign was undertaken in the summer and fall of 1774. but well known pioneer, James King, an active participant in the Irish rebellion of T798. He was captured by the British soldiery, tried, and condemned as a rebel, but escaped a short time before the day fixed for his execution, through some weakness of the sentinel at his prison, and sailed for America. These extensive improvements progressed rapidly under the general supervision of Robert Patterson, and were completed early in the year 1817. When completed, the proprietor assembled a few neighbors from the sparsely settled region to celebrate the occasion with appropriate dedicatory services. The furnace must have a name, and they wisely concluded to bestow that honor upon that noble matron, Mary Ann, wife of David Moore. The impressive ceremony of this christening con sisted in the hurling of a flask of whiskey against he huge stone stack, by Abraham C. Wilson. The township being organized later in the same year, received its name from the furnace. The enterprise was a successful one, not only to the proprietor, but to an immense section of coun try, furnishing the pioneers with much iron-ware of which they stood sadly in need. Hundreds, to day living, will remember the old May Ann seven plate stove, that stood upon a square box of brick and mortar in the center of hundreds of log cabin school-houses, in this and the adjoining counties; and in every bar-room it was the center of steady streams of tobacco juice. The sides were elabor ately embellished with two nude figures supporting a wreath of rudely carved flowers, on which sat a Cupid, showing conclusively that that little mis chief-maker was as well known in those days as at present. Two of the head men in the concern were William McKeever and his bachelor brother, James; both men of sterling integrity, yet full of Irish wit, fun and frolic. Prominent among the names of those on the old force were, also, those of Canly, Jamison and Jewett. The traveler up the picturesque and beautiful Rocky Fork valley, at the present day, will find, soon after passing the southern line of Mary Ann township, a huge pile of rocks, reminding him of the pyramids of Egypt on a small scale. This"], [523, "HISTORY FO LICKING COUNTY. 5i3 Stephen Giffin was a soldier of the Revolution, participating in the sanguinary battles of German town and Brandywine. He lived to a ripe old age, and died in Martinsburg, Knox county, in 1838, at the age of eighty-seven. Henry and Daniel Wilkins, before mentioned among the eailiest settlers, became owners of a body of land around what is now known as Wil kins' corners, at the bend of Lost run, in the western central part of the township. Some of this was very sine bottom land, and portions of the orig inal tract are yet in possession of the descendants of these pioneers. Llenry Wilkins erected a grist mill on the main fork of Lost run, in an early day, probably about 1830, which for many years did the grinding for the extensive settlement that gath ered around it; but it has not been in operation for some years. In an early day a road was established eastward from Chatham through here to the furnace, and another road from Newark, north and northeast, up the Rocky fork. Wilkins' corners is the point where these two roads cross, and in 1858 or 1859 Mr. James Randall established a store at this place. Two years later he sold out to William Dudgeon, who succeeded in getting a post office established, called Wilkins' Run post office. Mr. Dudgeon still keeps a store there. He was suc ceeded in the post office by Robert Stewart, but in turn succeeded Stewart, and was in turn suc ceeded by L. J. Westbrook, the present incum bent. The Grangers started a store here in 1S7 5, but sold out in the spring of 1S80 to Messrs. Othe & Wilkins, the present proprietors. These two stores, a blacksmith shop and a few dwellings con stitute Wilkins' corners. There is another post office in the northern part of the township, on the Rocky fork, called the \"Rocky Fork\" post office. Some years ago Mr. Thomas Nichols started a store here, and Mr. Cor nelius Hilleary erected a saw- mill and grist-mill. A few dwelling houses gathered around the store, and the place is called Nicholtown. The post office is now kept at Hilleary's mill. The road along the Rocky fork is narrow and winding, and often crowded between the immense rocky bluffs and the stream. Many mills were erected along this stream in an early day, the ruins of some of them yet remaining to mark their sites. The whole valley furnishes a prolific crop of immense bould ers, and great sandstone rocks cropping out of the bluffs, and piled up everywhere in the wildest con fusion. Some of the farmers, probably from not being able to find a level spot upon which to build, came down into the bottom and erected their houses in clusters on some level patch of ground ; hence, places like Nicholtown are frequent. There are but two churches within the township limits \u2014 United Brethren and Disciple. The first of these is located in the southern part of the township, near the line of Madison, on the farm now owned by Benjamin Nichols, whose father, John Nichols, gave the ground upon which the building stands. The foundation of this society was laid at the old Union chapel in Madison township, as early, per haps, as 1850, or before. A United Brethren con gregation was organized at this chapel, or prior to its erection; and, in connection with the New Lights, erected the building. This chapel being free to all denominations, the United Brethren could only use it part of the time, and as they grew in numbers, determined to erect a church of their own, which they accordingly did on Mr. Nichols' land. The first building was a frame structure, erected about 1850, and answered all purposes until 1877, when the present neat frame building was erected at a cost of six hundred dol lars. Among the earliest members of this society were Mr. Ralph Shaw and wife and John Nichols. Rev. David Shrader was instrumental in organizing this congregation, and active in the erection of the church ; hence, it was called Shrader's chapel which name it still retains. The present member ship is about sixty-five. The organization of the Sunday-school is coeval with that of the church, and has been maintained ever since. It is now in a flourishing condition, with a membership of sixty or more. About 1850, or before, the Protestant Method ists, in the northern and central part of the town ship, organized a class, and about 1850 erected a church edifice on the Rocky fork, on the Keys es tate. Mr. John Gutridge was the chief mover in this church, was largely instrumental in the organi zation, establishment and erection of the church hence, it went by the name of Gutridge's chapel."], [524, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 5J4 This gentleman contributed largely of his means, both to the building and support of the church. For a number of years this organization was suc cessfully continued, but in later years it languished; and finally, in 1872, the church building was sold to the Disciples. This society was organized by Rev. Allen Hickey, a son of William Hickey, who was prominent in the establishment of the church, as was also Mr. Jacob Miller, who resides near it. This church is in a\" flourishing condition, with a membership of thirty or more. A Sunday-school has been gener ally maintained duiing the summer, and now num bers, perhaps, forty members. A blacksmith shop and store have been established near the church, a few dwellings erected and the place is the counter part of Nicholtown. The people of this township are many of them yet living in the primitive log cabin, and appear to be but little troubled about the affairs of the great moving world around. CHAPTER LXIII.

She also disappeared in a short time, and was the last of the Indian race that had any kind of residence in the township. As late as 1819, an unoccupied wigwam still stood on E. Runnel's farm. This township was originally surveyed into four thousand acre tracts, it being part of the United States military lands. It is well watered by Clear fork and Brushy fork and their tributaries. A number of Springs are also found in various parts of the township. The lands are, for the most part, gently nndula ting, though there is some flat land and consider able that is level, while occasionally a hill of more or less altitude is found. It is a township of good and productive land. The timber is in consider able variety, such as the oak, walnut, beech, hickory and other varieties usually found in the early forests of Ohio. The land is adapted to the growth of corn, grass and the cereals usually produced in other sections of the county. The first settler of the township was John Price, THE Mound Builders left but few traces in Mc- Kean township. They were there, however, and built some works, one of which is a mound of small size, standing on the farm originally occupied by Thomas McKean Thompson, about four miles from the village of Granville. There is also a cir cular fort containing about an acre, with a shallow ditch around the inside of the embankment, on the land of James Barrick, in the northwest section of the township. It has been much plowed over, and now is barely traceable. It would command a view of the country around it, for miles, were it not for the trees. Half a mile south of it is a small mound, now nearly obliterated by the plow, on the land of the late Edwin Runnels. Mound Builders works abound in all the townships adjoining Mc- Kean. The Indian history of the township is somewhat meagre. They had an encampment on Cat run, about one mile above its entrance into the Brushy fork, as late as 1812, when they disappeared. A few Indians came to the vicinity of the old en campment, during or shortly before 1820; but all soon left except a squaw, who occupied one of the"], [525, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 5'S who, in 1806, settled near the Granville township line, and cleared what, in some circles, has since been called the \"Welsh Field,\" Mr. Price being a Welshman. In 1807 or 1808, Mr. John McLane settled on the Brushy fork. He was an emigrant from Hun tingdon county, Pennsylvania, and did not remain permanently, but returned to Pennsylvania. He was one of the largest men that ever settled here, and procured a livelihood by hunting. He is yet remembered by a very few pioneers as a skilful, persistent, and successful hunter. One, \"Billy Evans,\" made the third settler in 1809, or perhaps late in 1808. Abraham Wright, the first justice of the peace in Newark, also settled in McKean in 1809. In 1810, a revolutionary soldier, named Will iam Smith, settled at the junction of Cat run and Brushy fork. His son John became one of the first justices of the peace, in 18 18, when the town ship was organized. Among the early settlers who came soon after Mr. Smith, were Daniel, Jacob and Joshua Gosnell, a Mr. Woods, Charles and Henry Bryant, John Armstrong, Fleetwood Clark, John Myers and his father, Hugh Kelly, Peter Snare, Owen Owens, John Parker, Major Pierson, Jabez Smith, Esquire Jaggers, Jacob Wright, Ste phen Runnells, David Danforth, Samuel Shaw, Elijah Hunt, Thomas McKean Thompson, Amos Farmer, and others. The first election in this township was held in 1 81 8, on a white-oak log upon the site of the vil lage of Fredonia. A hat was used for a ballot box, and thirteen votes were cast. Nearly or quite all the voters were elected to some office. The first saw-mill was erected by Aquilla Belt, on the Clear fork, above Chatham, in 181 7 or 1818. The second was built in 1821 or 1822, by Hugh Kelley, on the Brushy fork, where the road to Mt. Vernon crosses it. Captain Spelman built the third one, a year or two later, a mile above the other, on the same stream. This last was gen erally known as \"Pratt's mill.\" The first grist-mill in McKean was erected some time after the War of 181 2, on Clear fork, near the Newton township line, above Chatham, by Abraham Wright, and another sometime later, on the Brushy fork, also near the Newton township line. The first school was taught by Mr. Samuel Shaw in a house that stood near the present village of Fredonia. This was probably a little before the organization of the township in 1818. There are two villages within the limits of the township. Fredonia was laid out in 1829 by Spencer Arnold, David Wood, jr., and S. Shaw, and surveyed by Mr. Edwin Runnels. Sylvania was laid out in 1838 by Jesse and Abraham Gos nell. These villages are yet quite small, having seem ingly attained their full growth many years ago. The census of 1880 gives the population of Fre donia at eighty-six, and that of Sylvania at fifty. The early justices of the peace were John Smith, Samuel Shaw, Elias Howell, Moses Pier son, David Danforth, C. C. Jones, W. B. Harding, and B. C. McClain. Those of a later day were William Anderson, Warner C. Carr, Jacob Wright, T. B. Pease, J. L Johnson, S. C. Scales, William Bowers, Henry Loun, Henry Barrick, Joseph Bar rick, S. S. Wilson, and Samuel Barrick. Fredonia was made a post town more than forty years ago, and J. S. Duden appointed postmaster. His successors were T. B. Pease, W. H. Pease, Joseph Wyeth, Thomas Horton, G. W. Ingraham, Mrs. Bellows, Thomas Carpenter, and others. An office was once established at Cokesbury with W. Gleason as postmaster, but it was soon dis continued. An office was also established at Sylva nia, with Peter Buzzard as postmaster, but it, too, was soon abolished. Abraham Wright, who settled on the Clear fork in 1809, was a man of some prominence. He settled in Newark in 1802, and was, while there, an acting justice of the peace from 1803 to 1806, when he removed to Newton and afterward to this township. Samuel Shaw was an early teacher, esquire, sur veyor and an intelligent, influential citizen. Thomas McKean Thompson was an early set tler and a gentleman of extensive information and wealth. He served the county as commissioner from 1822 to 1825. He came from Pennsylvania, where he had served a number of years in the capacity of private secretary to Governor Mc- Kean. He gave the name to the township. Colonel Cornelius Devinney w-as also a man of"], [526, "5'6 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. mark in KcKean. He was a Virginia gentleman of the \"old school\" \u2014 affable and pleasant in his manners, of good conversational powers, and a man of sterling integrity. Elias Howell was also a leading man. He was well informed, and acquired great popularity among the people. He was collector of taxes from 1824 to 1827; sheriff from 1826 to 1830; State senator from 1830 to 1832, and a member of Congress from 1835 t0 '837- Major Jacob Anderson and Thomas B. Pease held county offices. The former was a commis sioner three years and the latter tieasurer four years. This township contains five churches at present. Cokesbury chapel, a mile or two above the present village of Sylvania, was the first church organiza tion in the township. It was an Episcopal Meth odist, and was organized about 1820. It is not now occupied for religious purposes, but was thus used for a brief period by a society of the Christian Union church, a denomination of recent organiza tion. The Baptist church was organized about 1827. They have a good church edifice in Fredonia. Rev. Mr. Wileman was its earliest preacher. Lie was followed by Elder Berry. A Congregational church once had an existence in the township. Preaching was sustained some years, first in Fredonia, and afterward in a neat church building in Sylvania, but the society, by rea son of deaths and removals, was compelled to dis band years ago. Revs. Rose and Whipple were its early ministers. There is a Christian or \"New Light\" church in Sylvania; also one on the Brushy fork. The latter is a fine building. The Methodists have a church on the western borders of the township, erected several years ago in place of Cokesbury chapel; also one in Fredonia. The first named is a neat edifice, called Liberty chapel. Elders Hughes, Farmer, Gardner and Cotterell, and Revs. Smith and White were among the early time preachers in McKean. These clerical gen tlemen were mostly of the \"Old School\" Baptists, and New Light or Christian denominations. Elder Amos Farmer, of the former denomination, preach- ed many years to a small society of the type designated or nicknamed \"Hard Shell Baptists,' at Root's school-house on Brushy fork. This society never reached a score in number, and finally ceased to exist. \"Unconditional election and reprobation and the final perseverance of the saints,\" constituted the gospel of the \"Old School\" Baptist preachers; and it was proclaimed \"without money and with out price.\" They exercised their ministerial func tions without fee or reward. They were mostly illiterate, and their style in the pulpit was of the home-spun order. Very plain, unpretending teachers they might be called, but as they charged nothing for their labors, and the public were not bound to hear them, there could be no just cause of complaint. They preach ed just what they believed to be the pure, unadul terated gospel and nothing else; and did that fearlessly, freely and honestly, regardless of king or country. They laid a heavy hand upon Ar minianism, tract, missionary, Sunday-school, edu cational and temperance societies, and utterly condemned a paid ministry. They went forth to perform the Master's work, they said, like the evan gelists and apostles of old, without script or purse, and sometimes more than intimated that salaried preachers were of the class of shepherds mention ed by Scripture writers, who would flee when the wolf approached. Freely they gave the best they had, honestly and in the fear of God, and though they might be mistaken, they could not be regarded otherwise than honest men. Rev. Isaac N. Walters was a more recent but a popular preacher. One of the most noted of all the pioneer preachers, who at early times officiated in this township, was the Rev. Joseph Thomas, more gen erally known as \" the pilgrim,\" who preached in the woods where Fredonia now stands, as well as at Mr. Daniel Griffith's and other places in the vi cinity, about sifty-fiye or sixty years ago. He was a man of rare eccentricity of character, and had considerable force as a camp-meeting orator. The \"Pilgrim\" was a leader of the sect commonly called New Lights, and frequently traveled in com pany with Mr. Walters, who was also a preacher here fully fifty years ago. Few pulpit orators"], [527, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 5'7 could enlist the feelings of a promiscuous assem bly more thoroughly, or move their symyathies more effectually, than Isaac N. Walters and Joseph Thomas. The former was a natural orator. He was slightly dogmatic, decidedly declamatory, giv en to efforts at eloquence in his exordiums, by the use of pretty words, and in his perorations, rather long sentences ; he was, however, a very interest ing extemporaneous speaker. Few were more flu ent, more eloquent in the pioneer sense of that word, or more popular. The following incident is related as evidence of his popularity: About fifty years ago, when the Presbyterian church of Newark, and other societies except the Methodists, occupied the upper room of the old court house for preaching purposes, an appoint ment was made for Rev. James Culbertson, of Zanesville, and also one for Rev. Isaac N. Walters at the same time and place; each, of course, knowiug nothing of the appointment of the other. When the hour arrived the house was full, and the stairs and space around the door crowded. Many belonged to the country, who came to hear Mr. Walters, his fame having gone abroad through all the region roundabout. Rev. Mr. Culbertson stated that he had been invited to preach there at that hour, and rather mildly insisted on doing so; and being the oldest man, Mr. Walters readily yielded in a remark or two, and observed that all who desired to hear him preach might repair to the old market-house that stood on West Main street, fronting the square, between the Palisade building and Dr. Patton's store. The result was that Mr. Culbertson preached to a few dozen people, and Mr. Walters to a very large crowd, which he held for hours in the open market-house. Joseph Thomas, the pilgrim, was a resident of / =3 Shenandoah valley, Virginia, but remained at home very little. ,He was an extensive traveler, and published a diary or book of travels; a rather in teresting work, in which this western country, then in a wilderness state, was described, and many adventures related. He also essayed poetry; his success in this line was not, however, pre-eminent. His uniform practice was to clothe himself in white, the outer garment being usually a long flow ing robe. He was a sort of Lorenzo Dow preach er, and as an evangelist attracted a large share of attention. His theological views were Arian, sometimes called Socinian. More than fifty years ago Lorenzo Dow took this township in his line of travel in the west, preaching but one sermon, however, within its limits. This was at the house of Mr. Driggs, who lived on the road from Granville to Mount Vernon, near the southern boundary of the township, in what was called the \"Blanchard settlement.\" It was a night sermon in a cabin to an audience of about twenty. The next morning he went to Granville and preached a sermon in the street. He was one of the,most eccentric preachers that ever appeared in the county. He was born in Coventry, Connecti cut, October 16, 1777, and died at Georgetown, District of Columbia, February 2, 1834. He was an extensive traveler throughout this country, and made several voyages to Europe. He began his itinerant life in 1796 as a Methodist. The pioneers of this township were principally Virginians, Marylanders, Pennsylvaviians and Jer seymen, with a small sprinkling of Yankees. It is an interior township, having no great thorough fare extensively traveled, no turnpike, canal, rail road or telegraph."], [528, "CHAPTER LXIV.

MONROE township was organized in 1812, and included a square block in the northwest corner of the county, embracing the present town ships of Monroe, Liberty, Bennington and Hart ford. In 18 1 5 a line was drawn east and west, through the centre of this square and the north half called Bennington. In r827 Liberty town ship was created out of the east half of Monroe, leaving the latter township in its present shape. Under the first organization of Monroe \u2014 that is, when it was separated from Granville township \u2014 Esquire Moses Foster was the first justice of the peace, and C. L. Graves the first constable. The soil is about the same character as that of St. Albans. The altitude is somewhat greater; the land undulating and sloping to the southeast, is better adapted to grazing than to cereals. In an early day it was well timbered with all varieties of hard wood. It is fairly watered by the Raccoon fork and its tributaries. The head-waters of this stream are in this township. Few, if any, traces of Mound Builders exist within its limits; but the Wyandot Indians once lived here in considerable numbers. They built a town called \"Raccoon Town,\" a mile or more above Johnstown, on Raccoon creek, where they resided until 1807, when Charles and George Green pur chased their possessions, and thereafter occupied and cultivated the lands. The Indians remained some .time after this, in the township, except a small number, who erected a few small huts on, or near, the Brushy fork, not far from the present boundary line between Me- Kean and Granville townships. These last named remained until after the commencement of the War of 1 812. George W. Evans, generally known as Washing ton Evans, and Lucy, his wife, came from Green county, Pennsylvania, in 1806, and were the first settlers. Their daughter subsequently married Matthew Clark. Their son, John, ought to be considered the first white child born in the town ship, but from the necessities of the case, was born at the house of John Evans, a brother of Wash ington, who lived near St. Louisville. The Greens who bought out the Wyandots, were Virginians, and accustomed to frontier life. Mahala Green, daughter of George and Diana Green, born in the autumn of 1807, was the first white child born in the township. She subsequently married Bazil Butt. Mrs. George Green, yet living in this township at the age of ninety-two, is the mother of seven teen children, and rejoices in one hundred grand children, seventy great-grandchildren, and a num ber of great-great-grandchildren. A family named Steinmetz, was the fourth family in the township. Elisha Willison and Jacob Baker soon followed, and in 1815 there were about twenty-five families in the township. In 1S13 Dr. Oliver Bigelow, from New York State, who owned the southwest quarter of the township, laid out the town of Johnstown, which, however, until 1815, made little or no progress. In the latter year N. Alden, Henry Hoover, William Sellers and, probably, others made im provements in the town. From that time until 1830, the town and township increased rapidly in population. The town never grew, however, up to the expectation of its founders, and probably there"], [529, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. Si9 are few if any more people there at the present time than in 1830. Although the houses are mostly strung along on either side of the main highway, the town was laid out in the form of a square with a large public square in the center, as were the towns generally in the county. This square, at present, looks like a vacant field. Trees have, however, been set out around it, which, if cared for, will one day beautify it. The census, just completed, makes the population two hundred and seventy-eight. There are five stores of differ ent kinds, three wagon shops, two harness shops and three blacksmith shops. The churches number three, and the union school building contains four rooms, and three teachers are, at present, employed. More than two-thirds of a century this little town has lived without that great civilizer the rail road, but it has come at last. The track was re cently laid, and although no passenger train has yet made its appearance, construction trains are run ning, and just now (September, 1880) a neat, little depot building is being completed. Moses Foster, the first justice of the peace, died in 18 15, and Dr. S. A. Bigelow, who died in 1821, was the second justice. The first marriages were those of Ned Hatfield to Miss Timants, and Regnal Green to Sarah Willison. There are six churches in this township. Among the first of these was the Monroe Baptist church, one mile north of Johnstown, organized in 1819, by Rev. George Evans. The original members of this organization were Jacob Baker, Richard Orpret, Washington Evans and wife, M. Hoover, John Clark and Abram Barlow. For ten years services were held in the private dwellings of the members and in the neighboring school houses. In 1830 the present brick church was erected at a cost of six hundred dollars. Rev. Eli Ash brook was one of the earliest ministers in this church, serving five years. He was followed by Elders Darrow, Berry, Gildersleeve and Lyman. Rev. Hanover is present pastor. The present membership is twelve. The Baptist church of Johnstown was organized in 1839, by F. R. Freeman. The original mem- bers were William Beers, Eli Pratt, James Hoover, Simeon DeWolf, F. R. Freeman, John Clark, Julius Freeman, John French, William Gisesell, Mary Peck, Irene Baker, Eva Violet, Lucy Mor gan, Anna Crosby, Betsey Morgan, Elizabeth Dolph, Lavina Beers, Rebecca Best, Mary Clark, Minerva Hoover, Mary Downing, Rachel Phillips, Barbara Shoemaker, and Annetta Baker. The present church was erected in 1869, at a cost of four thousand dollars. Among the early pastors of this church were Elders Griswold, Sedgwick, Macy and Miller. The present pastor is D. W. Fields; the present membership, thirty. The Sunday-school, organized in 1869, has a membership of fifty. Mrs. Lenora Adams is present superintendent. The Methodist Episcopal church, known as Monroe Chapel, was organized in 1837, in a school-house, in which the services were held un til the erection of the present church, in 1840. The organization was effected principally through the influence of Uriah Heath, and the original members were Joseph B. Crammer, John Robi son, Henry Heckathorn, Thomas Leitew, William Miller and Mr. Cole. The church is a weak one at present, number ing about six members; but a good Sabbath-school is sustained, with a membership of thirty-five; this was established about the time the church was erected. The first Presbyterian church of Johnstown, was organized July 15, 1837, by Joseph Mat thews. A k\\v of the original members were David Conway, John Follett and Henry Le Due. A church was erected in the same year in which the organization was effected, costing about one thousand two hundred dollars. The church is not a strong one, having, at present, but twelve members. The pastor is Edward Garland. Methodist Episcopal church of Johnstown. \u2014 This is among the oldest in the township, having been organized in 1820 by the well known Russel Bigelow, who, at that time, had charge of the Columbus circuit. Mr. Bigelow organized many of the early Methodist churches in Central Ohio. The organization took place at the residence of George Green, who with his wife and Rignal, and"], [530, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 520 Charles Green and their wives constituted the first members of this organization. The first Method ist meeting was held in Peter Stephen's tavern, and for five years this society held meetings at private houses and the school-house. In 1825, their first church edifice was erected. It was a small frame, and cost about three hundred dollars. In 1842, a quarterly meeting was held in Jacob Foulk's new barn, at which thirty persons united with the church, and much interest was mani fested. A new church was erected this year at a cost of about one thousand dollars. Both of these church buildings are yet standing; the first being used as a dwelling. Russel Bigelow minis tered to this church during its early years. The present pastor is F. S. Thurston. The church records show a membership of fifty-four. A Sunday-school has, for years, been connected with the church, and at present numbers about forty, including scholars and teachers. George Foulk is superintendent. Jacob Foulk and wife, who are yet living, were very early members of this church. They are pioneers, and are now looking back through the mists of something more than eighty years. The United Brethren in Christ. \u2014 This church was organized in 1863, by Rev. William McDan iels, assisted by Silas Priest, Benjamin Clouse, Benjamin Green, Joseph Smith and Elisha Green. They held meetings in what is known as the Kaw school-house, the first few years, and, in r866, erected the present church edifice. It is a neat, substantial building, and cost one thousand one hundred dollars. At present the membership is sixty-seven. The organization of the Sunday school was coeval with that of the church, and now embraces sixty-three members."], [531, ""], [532, "522 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY"], [533, "CHAPTER LXV. NEWARK TOWNSHIP. Mounds, Mound Builders and Ancient Works in This Township. \"What is there new atop of this old world? Should e'er I come to write your books, why I Would search among the quaint and dusty tombs While the selfish world sought pleasure and repose.\" \u2014 Joaquin Miller. WITHIN the limits of this township are located some of the most astonishing, as well as the most complete and complicated works of the Mound Builders. The immediate vicinity of Newark seems to have been a sort of head quarters, or great central city. Newark, indeed, is built upon the ruins of the works of this mysteri ous people, many mounds having been leveled to make way for streets and buildings, and the city has extended into the great works, of which a cut is here given. This drawing is taken from a survey by David Wyrick, in 1860, and gives a faithful outline of the Old Fort, and the connecting works within a radius of one mile. The outlying works are nearly obliterated, with the exception of some of the parallel lines and the Octagon fort and its con necting circle. The larger circle in the drawing marked \"thirty acres,\" represents the most promi nent and best preserved of all this series of works and is now owned and used by the Licking County Agricultural society; its preservation being thus as sured. The portions of the cut represented by a square, and parts of the lines of an oblong, are nearly obliterated by the growth of the city of Newark in that direction. The octagon and circle marked respectively \"fifty acres\" and \"thirty acres,\" have been par tially subjected to the leveling processes. The whole plain between the South and Rac coon forks of Licking river, and covering an area of several square miles, bears tracesoj occupation by the \"lost race.\" It is evident from the remains here found, that this section was densely popu lated, and the character of the works, too, bear out the assumption that this people passed through the different stages of existence that fall to the changing experience of nations at the present day. The following description of the Old Fort is probably the most accurate as to measurements and other particulars yet given, being the result of actual surveys made by Colonel Charles Whittle sey, of Cleveland, and Isaac Smucker, esq ., Newark : \"The Old Fort is situated a mile and a half in a southwest erly direction from the court house in Newark, and belongs to the class of Mound Builders' works known as inclosures. It is not a true circle, the respective diameters being eleven hundred and fifty, and twelve hundred and fifty feet. Its banks, nearly a mile in length, were formed by throwing up the earth from the inside, which left a ditch of sloping sides, ten feet (in manv places more) in depth, and ranges, in perpendicular height, measuring from bottom of ditch to top of bank, from twenty to thirty feet. This inclosure, which embraces within it about twenty-seven acres of land, was constructed on level ground. and the ditch above described was often seen, during the earlier decades of the present century, partially, and sometimes wholly, filled with water all around the circle. From some cause it has not held water of late years to any great extent. Viewed from the outside, the embankment does not rise more than ten to fifteen feet above the surface of the surrounding ground, but observed from its top, the eye taking in the depth of the ditch, it seems, of course, much higher, so as to corres pond in height, at least, to the figures above given. \"The Old Fort has an entrance or gateway, which is flanked by a high bank or parapet on either side of it, running outward forty yards. The gateway and parallel walls or parapets are on the eastern side of the circle, and the ditch which follows it also extends to the termination of the parallel banks that cover tbe entrance. Here the banks are highest; the parallel walls, as well as those which form the circle immediately adjoining them at the gateway, reaching, for a short distance, a perpen dicular height of at least thirty feet, measuring from the bottom of the ditch, or twenty feet, measuring on the outside. The gateway or entrance measures seventy-five feet between the ditches or moats, and between the parapets or banks of earth that flank the entrance, one hundred and thirty feet. 5=3"], [534, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 524 \"Trees of a large size are still growing upon the banks, all around the circle, as well as upon the parallel walls at the en trance. They are equal in size to those that are yet found both on the outside of the inclosure and within it, and of the same varieties. Some of them measure ten feet in circumference and are still thrifty, giving no indications of decay. One of the largest trees that stood on this embankment was cut down in 1815, and its concentric circles showed that it had attained to the venerable age of five hundred and fifty years. Many others of its cotemporaries, too, are still flourishing and enjoying an equally vigorous 'green old age.' This fact may be borne in mind as indicating the antiquity of this wonderful wotk, espe cially when taken in connection with the strong probability that this tree, of now more than six centuries ago, was more likely of the second or third growth of trees than of the first, after the Mound Builders had erected this inclosure, which is only one of the extensive series of labyrinthine works, whose em bankments measure many miles in length, and which, by low parallel banks, were connected with others of similar character, as remote from them as arc those of the Hock-Hocking and other distant places. \"In the middle of the Old Fort is an elevation, evidently artificial, which never fails to attract the attention of the observ ing, and is generally designated as Eagle mound. It is full six feet high, and is in the form and shape of an eagle in flight, with wings outspread, measuring from tip to tip two hundred and forty feet, and from head to tail two hundred and ten feet, and is clearly of the effigy class of the works of the Mound Builders. It faces the entrance, and therefore lies in an east and west direction, its wings extending north and south. Ex cavations made many years ago into the center of this earthen figure, where the elevation is greatest, developed an altar built of stone, upon which were found ashes, charcoal and calcined bones, showing that it had been used for sacrificial purposes. \" Many have held the opinion that the Old Fort was a mili tary work, constructed for defence, but its location on a level plain, its symmetrical form and inside ditch, and the indications of the presence of fire, seen on the altar, and its sacrificial uses, so clearly suggested, all go to render this opinion to be erro neous, or, to say the least, one highly improbable. All the known facts pertaining to it go to raise the presumption that within this inclosure were conducted by Mound Buiders, the rites and ceremonies of their religion, they having manifestly been a religious and superstitious race, given to the practice of offering up human as well as animal sacrifices. ' ' Others have believed that the Old Fort was the seat of government of the Mound Builders, and that their monarch re. sided here; and still others have held that within this inclosure they practiced their national games and amusements, similar, possibly, to the Olympic, Nemean, Pythean, and Isthmian games that were so universally popular with the enlightened Greeks during the 'Lyrical age of Greece.' Others still, hold different opinions, but I think the weight of evidence is alto gether in favor of the theory that the Old Fort, one of the most renowned of all the Mound Builders' works, was constructed for the uses of a sacred inclosure, and was, therefore, primarily built and used for purposes connected with their religion; albeit it may also have been their seat of government, and residence of their monarch; and may, possibly, also have been sometimes used for the practice of their national games. Least likely of all is the notion that it was constructed for military purposes, or was ever used as a defensive work. \"It was in October, 1800, when Isaac Stadden, a pioneer set tler in the Licking valley, discovered it. One of the most astonishing and incomprehen sible things about this great earthwork is the ditch inside of it. This, as Mr. Smucker says, is yet ten feet deep, and is, probably, fifteen or twenty feet wide at the top. If it were not for the immense trees that yet stand on the embankment, one would be inclined to place the construction of this work within the last century, from the fact that other wise this ditch should have long since disappeared, having been filled, by the yearly drift of leaves, etc., to the surface of the ground. When the fact is considered that this ditch has stood in the midst of the forest for centuries, and has thus been a safe receptacle for the yearly fall of leaves that would naturally drift into it, that the storms of centuries have been washing its banks, that, as Mr. Smucker says, water once stood a good portion of the year in it, with its relaxing and dissolving tenden cies, the absorbing questions are, how deep must this ditch have been at first, and what tools could the workmen have used to raise the dirt to such a height, and for what purpose was it constructed; why, especially, was it made so deep? Supposing that from all the causes above enu merated, the ditch had filled one inch per year for six hundred years; even that would give it a depth of fifty feet at first. It would seem more probable that it would fill five or six inches every year, in stead of one inch; and it is thought these works are a thousand years old instead of six hundred. This being true, would make this ditch very much deeper, and only increases the mystery that already surrounds these works. Here is an oppor tunity for scientific investigation that should not be lost. A shaft sunk in the bottom of this ditch would probably reveal its original depth. The immensity of these works is truly wonder ful and awe-inspiring. The stranger visiting them for the first time can only look and wonder. The pyramids of Egypt are counted among the \"seven wonders of the world,\" but in what particular are they so much more wonderful than this earthwork? Both are equally mysterious and incomprehensible. The \"Eagle Mound\" in the center of this inclo sure, is somewhat disappointing at first sight, and does not appear to have much resemblcnce to an"], [535, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 525 eagle. It more resembles the shape and form of a honey-bee, and might more appropriately have been called the aHoney-Bee mound.\" The wings are not pointed, like those of a bird, but circular, like those of a bee, and the body is shaped much like that of the bee. Samuel Park, esq., thus writes concerning these works: \"Mr. Atwater says that many of the writers on these antiqui ties never saw the works themselves, or if they did, it was only from some public conveyance in hasty flight through the coun try; and consequently they know nothing about them, and their representations are not reliable. This, no doubt, in some in stances is true. But those newspaper correspondents, and other persons seeking literary renown, are not the only persons chargeable with having arrived at conclusions, and published opinions, based upon observations quite too superficial. Mr. At water himself, with all his care, is not safe from this charge, for in his report on the antiquities of Licking county, though he made a personal survey of them, seems to have but little knowledge of their extent and diversity of character. He gives us very correct diagrams of a portion of the works in Cherry Valley, and speaks of one or two mounds, south of Newark, and some pits below Newark, and south of Licking river. These he calls the works in Licking county, while they constitute but a very small proportion of them. He also says these works are situated on an elevated plain, forty or fifty feet above the al luvium or creek bottoms, and generally forty feet above the country around it, while in fact, they are situated on a low plain, not more than forty or fifty feet above the present worn channels of the stream, and nearly surrounded by high hills, on which are but little, if any, less than one hundred mounds that look down upon that valley, or plain, and its works, none of which does it appear that Mr. Atwater had any knowledge of. Besides this. those works extend nearly or quite all over the county, and east into Muskingum and Coshoeton counties, south into Perry and Fairfield counties, and west into Franklin county; and I doubt not, if carefully examined, would be found in a continuous line to the Mississippi. If their builders did not constitute one great nation or kingdom, they constituted several laige cities, with extensive country surroundings, and enjoyed such fraternal relations wtth each other as to leave no trace of the lines of divis ion, or any marks of discord or bloody wars. But on the con trary, they have left us an abundance of monumental testimony that there has been a well arranged and thoroughly organized civil government. I do not hesitate to express the opinion that the great mass ot those antiquities are the monuments of peace, and not of war, as is generally supposed. My reason for this opinion is, their want of adaptation to military purposes. \"Nearly all the circumvallations, or forts, so called, are con structed with the moat, or ditch, inside of the wall, and many of them are verv small, ranging from one to two hundred feet in diameter, and of easy approach at any and all points on the outside. Now to call such works military fortifications, is not only absurd, but^supremely ridiculous. I care not what princi ple of warfare you may assign to these Mound Builders, or what weapons they may have used, whether the primitive sling, the bow and arrow, the javelin, the dart, the sword, or cutlass, or any kind of explosive weapons. For any, or all of these, they were useless, as places of security, or for defence. It was a common custom, among the ancient nations of the earth, to carefully guard the lives and dignity of their rulers, by prohib iting the promiscuous approach of their subjects. This is still the case with some nations; it is done in various ways; the most common is by military guards, who were chosen with reference to their good will and attachment to the person or thing to be guarded. But in the great city of the Assyrian empire (Baby lon) the palace of the ruling prince, though protected from the approach of enemies by the great wall of the city, was also pro tected from the near approach of his own people by three ad ditional strong walls surrounding the palace within the city. It was much the same with the Jews, although they were the chosen people of God, and reputed to be the righteous nation of the earth, and were entrusted with the secrets of Jehovah, which when unfolded by the fullness of time were to become a blessing to the world, still they could not be trusted to govern themselves by their moral sensibilities, but were limited in their approaches to their own sacred tabernacle and their Great temple, by the outer courts which surrounded them. But we need not name isolated cases, for the principle has been common to all ages. If any of us to-day were to attempt to visit St. Peter's at Rome; the Mosque of Omar, at Jerusalem; the Palace of Napoleon, in France, or of Victoria, in England, we should find them all strictly guarded. Just so with the ancient people that erected these American antiquities, they understood human nature well enough, to know that it was better to spend money, and labor to maintain the peace and dignity of their government, by guarding against trouble, than to spend it to quell insurrection. Hence these numerous monuments of their wisdom and great ness spread all over our lands. And it is left for us, without the aid of letters to study the theory of their government from these mute relics of a pre-historic age. \"Mv own theory in regard to these strange works has been shadowed forth in what I have already said. 1 have told yu I looked upon them as the monuments of peace and not of war. The circumvallations, or inclosures of what ever form are the outer-courts of seals of royalty, and of temples of worship, and inclosures of magazines or public stores, of public parks, or pleas ure grounds while others were for athletic exercises and other public games. We find the works varied in their character, and well adapted to these several uses. Those whose nature indi cate the location of seals of royalty, or of temples of worship, are so constructed that the outside multitude could easily ap proach to within a suitable distance to offer their adulation to the princes, or their adoration to the gods, and witness the sac rificial offerings of the priests in the temples, yet the deep moat inside of the wall guarded those sacred precincts from the press of an enthusiastic or a sacreligious multitude. The same may be said as to the adaptation of those whose natuie and location indicate other uses, whether for pleasure or for the protection o public stores. In some places these works are numerous and expensive, and indicate a crowded state of society, or rather a large city population. The works gradually grow more sparse as they recede from these apparently central points, but with occasional minor clusters that indicate the location and protec tion of subordinate rulers, the location of magazines, etc., yet we find no signs of discord or of separate independence. Such a <reat central city do we think once occupied the hills and val leys of Licking, and centered on Cherry valley. ' ' To the greater part of the mounds we assign the character of watch-towers and signal stations, from which the watchmen kept a constant look-out and, by concerted signals, could report any incipient move towards insurrection or insubordination to"], [536, "526 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. the laws, as well as to announce the signs of the times, or the approach of danger from the elements, or from any other source. The location of these mounds not only indicate such a use, but is such as to greatly facilitate such a mode of com munication with rapidity and certainty. The idea of such an attache to the government as a watchman is not novel, for such an office was common among the primitive oriental gov ernments, and judging from the writings of Isaiah and Eze kiel, they were found among the Jews at a later date than that of the erection of these American antiquities. In an age when letters were unknown, watchmen, and such a system of signal communications, were of great importance in the government of a large tribe or nation. There are in some places, usually on level plains, many small mounds that were doubtless erected as tumuli for the distinguished dead, while there are others that seem to combine several uses. But the greater portion of the scattered mounds were, doubtless, for the use we have assigned them, and constituted a system of communication extending from the center to the circumference of the kingdom, equaled only by the modern telegraph. These watchmen were doubt less among the learned men of the nation or tribe, and their position an honorable and an honored one in the kingdom, for they must have constituted the principal medium of communi cation between the different and distant portions of the king dom. Having been educated for this special office, it was prob ably held for life, and I should not think it incredible to suppose that vaults may have been prepared in the base of their watch-towers to receive their mortal remains, after having been worn out in the service of their country, that they might, after death, continue to enjoy a relation to their honored position in life. This may account for the few human bones found in some of those scattered tumuli. \" The mathematical skill manifest in the construction of some of these works, as well as the fine topographical engineering shown in the location of these signal mounds, indicate a pretty high degree of culture, for that age of the world, and. I think, conclusive evidence that they were not erected by the ancestors of our native Indians, as it is not probable that they ever ad vanced beyond the hunter-grade of civilization in which we found them, while our Mound Builders must have been much in advance of this. These signal mounds are not always found on the highest hills, but where they will command the most complete view of the whole land, whether below or above their location, and where they can be seen by the greatest number of other mounds, by views through valleys, or between distant hill tops. This feature is an important one, and cannot be the result of accident. On the contrary, it shows a careful economy in locating them, so as to attain the object of their erection with the least amount of labor possible. This would have been needless had their design been other than that we have assigned them. They would, in many instances, have much better suited the theory of ' worship in high places, ' or of ' monuments for the dead,' if they had been differently situated from that in which we find them. We, in one instance, found a mound on an offset or table on the hillside, where it commanded the view of an adja cent valley that could not have been seen from the top of the hill, while there was none on the hill-top, seventy-five feet above the plain or level table on which the mound was situated. And yet this mound was but little less conspicuously situated in its rela tion to the other mounds than if it had been on the top of the hill. Again, the size of these 'tumuli' are, to a considerable extent, governed by the nature of the ground on which they are located. On high, narrow pointed, natural elevations, they are much less than when the hill-top presents a broad, level surface; also, on gently undulating plains they are larger and taller than when situated on the hills or on smooth plains. Another feature that I have noticed is : that their number is governed by the character of the face of the country where they are situ ated. On rough, broken lands they are numerous, while on smooth plains they are few. Still, where they are found at all they are found in sufficient numbers to overlook the whole sur face of the land. In our prairies of eastern Illinois, there are but few, except along the banks of the Wabash, but the few found away from the larger streams are generally large and tall, and so situated as to overlook a large district of country. Now, we would ask, why all this kind of discrimination, if their primary object had been of a military character, or for altars for sacri fices, or as monuments for the distinguished dead? \"In fact, such a theory is irreconcilable with the human un derstanding of the nature and relation of things. The mind must be educated to such theories before it can see any thing in these works to justify them, that these ancient Americans, like the ancient Egyptians, Ph\u0153nicians, Assyrians, Chinese, and other original tribes or nations, may have been superstitious in some things, and behind the present age in the arts and sci ences, may be quite true, but that is no reason why we should attribute to them intellectual inconsistencies that would sink them below the wild tribes, that roved through our forests when first found by the people of Europe. How many of us can give a rational account of the original design of the pyramids of Egypt? We may think we know, but with an unbroken chain of history reaching nearly back to the probable period of their erection, we still know but little about them ; yet they are there, and were erected by the most learned nation of that age. \"There are at least eight forts or circumvallations in the county that I know of, that are not noticed by any of those writers, except three mentioned by Mr. Smucker, and there cannot be less than three hundred mounds that are not noticed at all; yet when they are viewed as a whole, they present a very different feature than when seen in isolated parts, though these parts may have been the most prominent portion of the works. They must be examined from the center to the circumference, and the relation of the several parts to the whole, as well as the scientific harmony of those relations, must be studied to fully comprehend their use. Let any person that is well acquainted with the face of the country inform himself as to the location of fifty or one hundred of these scattered mounds in Licking county, and then let him ascend a few of them and imagine the timber all removed, and he will be astonished at the harmony of their relations. Nearly all will seem to be in plain view from almost every point. And, further, that nearly all seem to have been built with reference to the works in Cherry valley as a comman center. Cherry valley is that part of Licking valley, west of the city of Newark, that lies between the Pataskala and the Raccoon branches of the Licking river, extending from their junction up the Pataskala to the mouth of Auter creek, and up Raccoon creek some three miles to the range of Mis dividing the Raccoon and Auter creek valleys. It is a beautiful plain, the soil is gravelly but very fertile. It embraces about three thousand acres of land, and lies nearly in the shape of an equilateral triangle. On this plain are situated several of the largest and most singular artificial works to be found in the country. The principal one of these (so called) fortifications, which contains about thirty acres of land, is owned and occu-"], [537, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 527 pied by the Licking County Agricultural society, and the place where they hold their annual fairs. This part of the valley seems to constitute a central point in the extensive cluster of works lying in this and adjoining counties. \"After becoming satisfied in my own mind, by observations from various elevated points, that the arrangement and location of the works of Licking would justify the theory that Cherry valley was the central point, whence radiated the power that controlled and gave vitality to this great city, whose inhabitants perhaps numbered but little less than the present population of the whole State, this' beautiful valley and its works began to as sume an importance in this field of antiquities that I never had thought of before, though familiar with its curious works all my life. Now every antique artificial feature about it became an object of importance, that might have wrapped up in it volumes of valuable history. Not having found anything in 'Alligator mound' that I thought would justify the idea of its being con sidered an object of idolatrous worship, and having found the triangle in several of these artificial works, which is an ancient symbol of the true God, I concluded to again visit the great work owned by the agricultural society, and examine 'Eagle mound.' I went there without any doubts about finding the representation of an eagle spread out on the surface in the cen ter of the area enclosed by these great walls. But when I came to examine its form and proportions, I could not see the 'eagle nor anything that would justify the idea that the mound was ever intended to represent any living thing. It could not have been intended to represent a bird, because there is neither head, neck, or tail, and the wings do not taper towards the points, but on the contrary are even larger towards the extreme ends. The abdominal dimensions are much too large to be in proportion with the other parts. While the Alligator mound below Gran ville strikes conviction to the minds of all that see it, even at first sight, that it was intended to represent the great American crocodile, it cannot but require a great stretch of the imagina tion, to find any animal characteristics whatever in this so-called 'Eagle mound.' At least, such were my impressions; my feel ings would have harmonized much better with the idea of call ing it a representation of a man, in the act of swimming, with out any legs, which it might be said to represent pretty fairly. I do not think that it was intended to represent any thing of the kind; but on the contrary, that it is the ruins of a massive tem ple, or palace of a ruling prince, that had been erected with perishable material, such as unburnt brick. \"The main part of it appears to have been about fifty by one hundred and eighty feet, with vestibule and tower in front, and wings extending to the right and left some sixty feet in length from the main building- The wings fall back some twenty to twenty-five degrees from a right angle with the main building, and probably had towers at the extreme ends. This is indicated by the larger pile of earth at the end of the wings. My reasons for calling this the ruin of a large building are, first \u2014 its form being that of a large b,uilding, with wings to the right and left, and vestibule and tower in front, and second, its situation ; it being a little in the rear of the center from the great gate of the court that surrounds it, and fronting the entrance, or gate, of the court, just as I think a skilful draughtsman of any age would place such a building to be in harmony with its surround ings. In the thiid place, its materials; all the plain on which these works in Cherry valley are situated, is full of gravel, or pebble stones, even to the surface, and the walls of the court that surround it are of the same character, while the mound, or ruin, is composed of good brick-clay, free from gravel, and foreign to anything to be found in this vicinity. There is also another slight elevation of this same kind of clay outside of the court. It is situated to the right of the road, leading from the gate of the court towards the Pataskala, or South fork of Licking river, and indicates the former existence of a block of buildings, or guard houses, that extended some three or four hundred feet from the walls of the court, to, and beyond the site where the trustees are preparing to erect a hotel building for the use of the park. This bed of clay is from twelve to sixteen inches deep, resting on gravel, while but a few feet from it the gravel is found to come to the surface. This debris, lying, as it does, by the side of the passway to the only entrance to this royal court, and between the parallel walls, that jt is generally believed were erected to protect the passway from this sacred precinct to the river, is strongly suggestive of the location of a series of guard houses, to prevent the promiscuous entrance of improper persons to this well guarded seat of royalty.\" It would be impossible, at this day, even were it necessary or desirable, to locate all the earthworks and mounds within the limits of Newark township. The Cherry valley seems to have been literally filled with them, and they were thickly placed over a broad territory, including the site of the city of Newark and much of the Raccoon valley, while, as Mr. Park says, there are a hundred or more mounds on the surrounding hills that overlooked this great mound city in this valley. There is a mound within a short distance of the court house that is passed by scores of people, daily, on their way to and from business, that is scarcely noticed. It is located in the old cemetery on Sixth street, and|is eight or ten feet in height, and, perhaps, twenty-five or thirty feet in diameter. Some one has used it for a burying ground,' and erected a monument over their dead on its side. The fact of its being inclosed within the cemetery has pre~ served it from destruction by the plow. A curious group of mounds that attracted the attention and wonder of the pioneers, were unfor tunately destroyed by the building of the Central Ohio railroad. They were not far from the Old Fort, and stood just at the foot of Cherry valley, and a little east of the Ohio canal, where the above mentioned railroad crosses it. Three of these mounds stood in a line north and south; the fourth was a little east and between the two northern ones. They were all joined together at the base. In the destruction of this remarkable group of mounds, many interesting relics and facts were unearthed that appear worth preservation. The mound far-"], [538, "528 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. thest south was included in the embankment of the Central Ohio railroad, and was first destroyed. The other three were greatly injured by the earth being taken to make the railroad embankment. The northern mound was the largest, and was about twenty feet high. This was finally leveled to form a site for a rolling mill. The upper eight feet of this mound was composed almost entirely of black loam, which appeared in layers. These layers or strata had seams where the earth did not unite, although it appeared to be of the same char acter. Between these layers there were often marks of fire ; and in one place, from four to six inches extending across the mound, there were strong marks of fire, with charcoal and ashes. The dif ferent layers of earth did not often pass all over the mound \u2014 sometimes not over more than a fourth of it, and often overlapped each other at the edges. It would seem that these layers of earth were put on at considerable intervals of time, first on one side and then on the other, the different sides of the mound varying in structure. In the upper eight feet of this mound no human or other bones were found. Several fine sheets of mica were taken out. A hole near the center was observed to continue down very near to the bottom of the mound. In some places this was filled with sand, differing from the earth around it. In the lower eight feet ofthe mound quite a number of these perpendicular holes were observed. One on the east side was filled with fine charcoal and ashes, and extended fully four feet below the surrounding surface of the earth. The whole base of this mound was of dis turbed earth, four or more feet below the surround ing surface. Some six or eight of these post holes were discovered, but none but the center one con tinued for more than a few feet. They were mostly filled with fine sand. About one half of the lower portion of the mound was made of layers of blue clay; then there was a layer of sand, followed by one of cobble stone, which appeard to be immedi ately over a strong burning. This layer of stone was about five feet from the base. In the middle mound the layer of cobble stone was about eight feet from the base, was in the center of the mound, sixteen inches thick, and extended all over it, thin ning out toward the edges. The cobble stone, in all places, seemed to be put on immediately over the burning, none of the stones having the marks of fire, except those coming in contact with the burnt earth. The heat of the fire must have been intense, for the small stones in places were quite friable, and in places strongly marked with oxide of iron. This iron appearance led many to think that iron tools might have been placed there and rusted out. In the fourth mound the cobble stones were placed over burnings and on a level with the sur rounding surface, and covered with creek sand. The blue clay in the northern mound must have been brought from a distance, there being none near like it. About three feet below the surrounding surface of the earth, and near the bottom of the large mound, the workmen, in digging the pit for the fly wheel, found several pieces of bones and a part of the lower jaw of a human being with one tooth yet remaining in it. All the bones gave evidence of great age, and were in small pieces. The cobble stone layers in these mounds and the post holes are unusual features. Could the latter have been for a frame work, from which to suspend victims for sacrifice? Surrounding this entire group of mounds was a cobble stone way, about eight feet wide. This is yet plainly to be seen north of the railroad, but the remainder has been destroyed. This oblong circle of stone must have been one hundred yards in its north and south diameter, and sixty-six yards east and west. Within sight of this gronp of mounds were originally about one dozen. Many of these have been destroyed. The digging of the pit for the fly-wheel revealed the lower portion of this mound, better than examination heretofore made, and showed plainly that human beings had been buried at least four feet beneath the surrounding surface of the earth. During the excavating process the place was vis ited by many citizens, and gentlemen from a dis tance, and much interest taken. The greater portion of these mounds being com posed of sand and loam may account for the paucity of bones found in them. The best pre served skeletons are found where the ground is mostly clay. It was observed by the early settlers that the"], [539, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 529 Indians buried their dead in and about these mounds; but these burials were thought to be easily distinguishable from those of the Mound Builders. In 1827, while digging the Ohio canal, a small mound was dug out where the second lock now stands. Many human bones were found similar to those in the group above mentioned. Several skeletons were found buried near these mounds, which were, no doubt, those of Indians, the bones indicating no great age, and having cop per implements buried with them. Near one was found two copper quivers for arrows, and a large shell, which had apparently been used as a drinking cup. Another small skeleton had by its side a quiver for arrows and a copper hatchet, with beads and other trinkets. These Indians and Mound Builders appeared to have two things'in common; one is the copper implements, and the other the sheets of mica. This latter is found in their mounds and mixed with their pottery. The small Indian skeleton referred to above was partly covered with mica, some of it adhering to the bones. Another skeleton was found covered with arge sheets of mica; at least half a peck of mica with the bones were brought to town ; this, at the time, was supposed to be the remains of an Indian. All the copper yet found in the mounds in this re gion has been native, unsmelted. According to some antiquarians these mounds would be called sacrificial or altar mounds, but the truth is that most, if not all, in this vicinity, are of a similar character, and might, with the same pro priety, be called sacrificial, for, as a general thing, a skeleton, or sometimes two or three side by side are found, covered with earth, then evidences of fire, then another skeleton covered in the same way, and so on; bul these skeletons and evidences of fire do not extend regularly over the mound. Sometimes a skeleton and a burning will be found only on one side, and then again on the other, ata different elevation; but almost always in every mound is found one grand burning extending all over the mound, as if there had been a grand cer emony for the benefit of all those buried beneath. In the large mound above mentioned there were two of these general burnings. Sometimes human bones are found with the marks of fire, indicating the probability of human sacrifice. CHAPTER LXVI.

BUT little, if any, Indian history connected with this township has been preserved. A few tem porary camps are remembered, and that they roved freely through these beautiful valleys, hunted, fished and paddled their canoes along these wild and pretty streams ; sang their war songs, danced their war dances, fought, loved, married, ate, drank and died, is not doubted. They have left behind them history enough from which to glean this much, however worthless it may be. They seem to have been a worthless race, hence, in the econ omy of the univerce, they must perish to give place to those who develop and make better use of Na ture's unlimited resources. This township was not organized until June 6, 1810, but was surveyed in 1797, by John G. Jack-"], [540, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 53\u00b0 son, deputy surveyor under Rufus Putnam, then surveyor general of the United States. It is num ber two, range twelve, and contains sixteen thou sand four hundred and thirty-eight and nine-tenth acres. Number one, or the northeast quarter of the township or section was located by John Rath bone, and contains four thousand two hundred and eighteen and nine. tenth acres. This section was sold to Colonel Benjamin Wilson of Clarks burgh, Virginia, and has since been known as the \"Wilson section.\" Quarter township number two, is the northwest section, and was located by George Jackson. It contains four thousand acres. Sec tion number three is the southwest quarter, and was located by Adam Harborson. It contains four thousand acres, and is called the Cherry Valley section. Number four is the town section, and was located by J. A. Cummins and John and George W. Burnet. It contains four thousand two hun dred and twenty acres. There were many acts of Congress touching the manner of disposing of the unoccupied lands of the United States military tract, of which this township was a part, up to 1812, when the land department was reorganized; but none of them had any effect on this township, for the sections had all been located very early. Nearly the whole of this township lies in a sort of funnel-shaped basin, with the neck toward the Licking Narrows. It is watered by the North fork of Licking, which enters the township from the north, near the center of its northern line, and passing southeast joins the main stream near its eastern border; and by the South fork of Licking, which forms the southeastern line of the township to within a few miles of Newark,, joining the North fork within the city limits, and by the Raccoon fork, which coming from the west, thrugh Granville township, passes across this township a little south of its center, and joins the South fork within the city limits. In addition to these streams, which are all of good size, Ramp creek crosses the south ern part of the township, emptying its waters into the South fork, within its limits; and numerous smaller streams, tributaries of those named, cross the township in different directions. Coming toward Newark from the east, the hills on the right gradually recede, and near the city the bottom lands widen out abruptly. The highlands north of the city run nearly at right angles with the Licking river, forming the east bank of the North fork, and the highlands south forming the east bank of the South fork. This area of apparently level land, extends up the North fork to the mouth of Brushy fork, thence west and south along the base of the Welsh hills to Licking summit at the South fork, and down that stream to Newark. This con- stitutes the body of the \"funnel\", and contains twenty-five thousand acres of excellent land, that one would suppose, from a glance over it, was al- most level; yet from its western terminus to the \"Black Hand\" there is a fall of at least one hun- dred and forty feet in this distance of twelve miles. It will be observed that in almost every part there are gentle terraces downward, to all the various streams making all the surface of very easy drainage. The highlands north and south of Newark appear to be the western terminus of the great coal fields which extend to the Alleghanies. This large basin, or area of comparatively level land, in which Newark is situated, was once, like the bottom lands of the Licking, covered with a dense forest, and under- growth of bushes and wild vines; and on account of the numerous and rapid streams which centered in this valley, large quantities of drift wood blocked the streams and lay piled in every con ceivable shape and direction causing the waters to overflow and inundate a great portion of this basin whenever there was an unusually heavy fall of rain. When the floods subsided large pools of stagnant water were left here and there, which were the cause of much sickness among the early settlers. Perhaps in no other portion of the town- ship was this so obviously the cause of sickness as in the vicinity of Log-pond run. About one and a half miles northwest of Newark, this little stream, passing through this level ground, became obstructed, and spread over about thirty acres of woodland, causing the large timber to die and fall down, thus covering this large area with fallen timber, which could only be traversed by footmen walking on the logs. This was called the \"log pond,\" and gave name to the stream. A little fur ther north was another pond, clear of trees, called the \"Goose pond,\" which covered seventy-five or eighty acres at times, and was a famous resort for"], [541, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 53i wild geese and ducks. These ponds were par tially drained about 1817. There was another large pond directly west of Newark, w-hich contin ued to exist at a much later date. It covered forty or fifty acres, and was called the \"Big Prairie,\" being mostly clear of timber. It was full of muskrat houses, flags and grass. This pond was a somewhat remarkable one. It was dry in 1805; corn had been raised on it by some of the first settlers, and it was used in the fall of that year for a race-course; the posts where the judges had their station remained standing on tht^ east side, where the water was afterward several feet deep. It gave rise to much speculation among the settlers, who were unable to account for the fact that some seasons, when there was abundance of rain, the pond would nearly dry up; and again in other very dry seasons, the pond would be full of water. Regarding this, Dr. J. N. Wilson, from whose article this topographical matter is mainly taken, says: \"My attention was called to the dry ing up of this pond one summer soon after the water was let into the canal for the first time. Owing to the character of the sub-soil in most of this region, which is made up mostly of loose gravel and sand, the water percolated through it, filling up the wells and cellars fd\\ along the canal in its vicinity, but as the bottom became puddled the percolation ceased. Recollecting this fact, and remembering that the previous fall had been very dry, followed by a very cold winter which caused the water to be frozen to a great depth, thereby effectually breaking up the puddling at the bottom of the pond, at once explained to my mind the disappearance of the water the following spring and summer. There was no stream of water run ning into or out of this pond. It was located just north of the old fort.\" There is another fact which, no doubt, had a great influence in retaining in this funnel-shaped basin the poisonous miasms formed in it. The highlands, as above described, forming the sides of the basin, were covered with very lofty trees, principally oak, with a dense undergrowth, mingled in many places with spruce and other evergreens, which came to the very edge of the Licking river, and in many places the tops of these large trees nearly came together from the opposite sides of the stream, thus forming a complete barrier to the winds, and damming up, as it were, the outlet of this funnel. This obstruction was not greatly disturbed until the construction of the Ohio canal, and subsequently by the building of the Ohio Central & Steubenville railroads. The quarrying of stone and the clearing of the forests has at last made a complete outlet for the winds, which may now sweep freely through this passage and give complete ventilation to the basin above. This has no doubt played an important part in improving the health of this great basin. The cultivation of the soil, the drainage of the ponds, the clearing away of the drift-wood from the streams, and the building of good houses, and other comforts, have converted this once sickly locality into a region as healthy and beautiful as can be found in the State. The alluvial as well a diluvial deposit is by no means of uniform depth in this basin. It may be a hundred feet in places to the bottom, yet in others, as where the Central Ohio railroad crosses the Licking river, the original rock comes to the surface; and again two miles up the North fork the rock appears. The great amount of decom- posible matter contained in this gravelly plateau has disappointed many in their estimates of the durability of the soil for tillage. The very early settlers feared that as soon as the vegetable mould that formed the surface should be exhausted by tillage, the soil would become sterile and worth- less. Fifty years ago it was said that such and such fields were about worn out, but the recuper- ative power of this soil, by the decomposition of the limestone and other earthy compounds, is won- derful, and these same fields continue to yield the best crops, equal to any of the newer lands, and making more certain crops from the fact that they are less affected by any excess or want of rain than clay soils. Whatever else was produced in this basin, it was very certain to produce, in pioneer times, an abundant crop of fever and its accom- paniments, and verified the saying of the Indians , \"that the Lick-Licking was a bad place to raise papooses.\" And it is a mistake to suppose that it took but few years to change this miasmatic region into a healthy one. It was soon found that where the trees were cut down and the under-brush cleared"], [542, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 532 away, there immediately sprang up in the places thus exposed to the sun, the most luxuriant growth of weeds, grasses, vines and plants, covering all the partly cleared lands, which more than compen sated for the removal of the trees. This growth was very vigorous, and formed a covering for many wild animals as well as large numbers of venomous reptiles. These were a continual dread to the early settlers, and not only to the settlers, but the horses and cattle were in constant fear o( them, and often suffered from their poisonous fangs. Dr. John Newman Wilson was one of the early and prominent settlers of Newark, and identified with its interests and prosperity during his long life of seventy years. His father came here in 1806 with a numerous family, all of whom left the mark of their individuality upon this county. Dr. Wilson was long an honored member of the pio neer society here, and died in October, 1868. The following regarding the early diseases preva lent in Newark and vicinity, is from one of his interesting and valuable papers. From it may also be gleaned other matters pertinent to the early history of Newark : \"My father and family moved to and settled near this city in 1806, when I was a small boy, and consequently I must rely on older and earlier settlers for most of my facts, and from none have I received information, more capable of giving it, than from my medical preceptor, the late Dr. John J. Brice. Dr. Brice, in his youth, resided in the healthy county of Harrison, West Virginia, where he had the advantage of a good prepara tory education. He read medicine in Pittsburgh and Union town, Pennsylvania. During his studies he obtained some notoriety by being, perhaps, the first to practice vaccination west of the mountains, which I think was in 1801. \"His preceptor had obtained some vaccine matter from a then representative of Kentucky, as he passed by Uniontown on his way home from Congress. This virus had been sent to the President of the United States by Dr. Jenner, of London, to be distributed to members of Congress. \"His preceptor, Dr. Simonson, having little faith in this in novation turned the matter over to his pupil, \"Jack Brice,\" who immediately began his tests. It soon created widespread interest. Dr. Brice, thereafter, always took great interest in the subject of vaccination, and was the most careful physician I ever knew in the selection of virus. His mode of vaccination was peculiar. He made it a rule, whenever he could, about the tenth day after vaccination, to examine the pock, and if well matured, he would make a slight puncture with the lancet, take some virus and insert it in the other arm of the same person, so, as he said, to go through the same process as the first, and destroy any remaining susceptibility that might exist. I have yet to learn that any of the early settlers who were vaccinated by Dr, Brice, have had even varioloid. He must have vaccin ated hundreds of families in this county. \"Dr. Brice located in Newark in November 1803, I think, having a good opinion of his qualifications ; and many of his old acquaintances having settled in and about Newark, they gave the commencement of his professional career an impetus, and he had high expectations of success. \"In the beginning of his practice he had to deal principally with inflammatory diseases, particularly pleurisy, which he said was much more common at that time than in after years. In his treatment of inflammatory diseases his success equaled his expecjations, except in that of rheumatism, which was then as stubborn as it has ever since been. In his treatment of inflamma tory fevers, cathartics, antimonials and the free use of the lan cet with blisters, usually effected a cure. Most of the early settlers were from the healthy regions of Virginia and Pennsyl vania, and he thought they bore blood-letting better than they did after remaining for a time in this unhealthy and miasmatic section \u2014 as it then was. When the summer and fall diseases began he found they did not so readily yield to the lancet and his doses of \"ten and ten,\" as taught by Dr. Rush, a famous Philadelphia physician, but he persevered. \"He found that by his treatment the remittent fevers seemed to yield, in part, and assume the intermittent or ague form; but when winter came plenty of his patients were still shaking, yet he did not give up the use of the lancet, but tried it in every stage of the disease; often bleeding just before, as well as in, the cold stage, and sometimes with success; but when he saw the result in many cases, such as enlarged spleen, dropsy and other sad consequences, together with the murmuring of his patients, he felt but little flattered by his success. It is true he did not confine himself entirely to the remedies above men tioned, but sometimes used emetics, Peruvian bark and opium, though sparingly. He also made some use of Virginia snake root, poplar bark, willow, dogwood and cherry. \"Dr. Brice having founded his practice on the theoretical views of Dr. Rush, believing with him that yellow fever was only a higher grade of bilious fever, in all its forms; and that if Dr. Rush succeeded by giving his doses of \"ten and ten\" of calomel and jalap, and in the use of the lancet, he could not conceive why the milder forms of the disease should not yield to the same treatment. He felt so vexed with his want of success, and so disappointed in his expectations, that he returned to his friends in Virginia, determined to abandon the profession and look up some other vocation in life. His brother, however, dissuaded him from this, and induced him to visit Philadelphia and consult Dr. Rush. He attended part of one course of lec tures there, and related to Dr. Rush his disappointments. The latter took an interest in his statements, and advised him to re turn to his field of labor, telling him that Dr. Caldwell, who had been his student, was then engaged in translating a work from the Latin he thought would be of great service to him; advised him to procure a copy and be governed by it in his practice. This work he obtained in 1805, before leaving Phila. delphia. I am certain that this book must have saved the lives of many of the pioneers. \"Dr. Brice having purchased a good supply of medicines in Philadelphia, including a good quality of chinchona bark, an article not always easily obtained, returned to Newark and re sumed his practice. The lancet was used more sparingly, and only to relieve some organ from the violent action of the heart. Calomel and jalap were used to disgorge the bilious matter and correct the biliary secretions. This, with the free use of the bark during the intermissions of the fever, became the founda-"], [543, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 533 tion of his practice. His success now came fully up to his ex pectations, and he had plenty of business. \"The country was sparsely settled, and he made long rides into the country, often going into adjoining counties. At that time it was the remittent form of fever that gave the most per_ plexity, this sometimes proving fatal. In accordance with Se_ nac's advice, he gave up bark during the remission in cases where he apprehended danger. In many of these cases coma often occurred early; in these his main reliance was on the bark. His favorite mode was to give it in a decoction, acidulated with sulphuric acid; but in ordinary cases it was taken in doses of a teaspoonful in wine every hour, or mixed with a decoction of Virginia snakeroot. A very common way, too, was to ad minister it in doses of a teaspoonful in the common beverage of the country, whiskey. \"An old and popular psescription was: bark, one ounce; Virginia snakeroot, one-half ounce; sal tartar, twelve grains; whiskey, one pint: drink ad libitum. \"It was not long until a prejudice arose against the use of barks by those who had protracted ague, they attributing to the remedy what was the result of the disease, saying they could feel the effect of the bark in their bones, as people often now say their bones are full of quinine. (Quinine was first used here in 1825, the first ounce costing sixteen dollars.) \"It is a mistake to suppose that typhoid fever did not occur among the early settlers. My eldest brother laid the greater part of the year 1805-6 with this fever. It was then called typhus. \"In the winter of 1812-13 snow was sufficient for the running of sleighs and sleds most of the winter; there was, perhaps, bet ter sleighing than has been known since, so that corn, oats, pork flour, etc., were taken to Sandusky and other points on the lakes, from this place, on sleds. This was not only a great ad- vantage to the pioneers, but a God-send to the army then fight. ing the British, Near the close of the war an epidemic of the most fatal character prevailed, known by the name of 'Cold plague. The attack was mostly violent chill followed by fever and se- vere pain in some region, generally in the lungs, but often in the brain, and sometimes in the bowels or limbs, the pain often preceding the chill. Delirium soon attended and the patient sank; the disease often proving fatal in forty-eight hours. If it lasted several days the symptoms were generally of a typhoid character. At first most of the cases proved fatal; blood- letting was found to be injurious, and medicines of all kinds seemed equally so. The practice finally adopted was that of putting the patient to bed and dosing with warm teas and warm applications to the exterior surface. The boughs of the spruce pine were extensively used for this purpose, and it was thought the pine had some peculiar virtue in this disease. This fatal epidemic swept over the country at that time, much the same as the cholera has since done. \"The measles and whooping-cough prevailed with the early settlers as they have since; also colds and influenza. Diarrh\u0153a never prevailed as an epidemic in our early settlements until the approach of the cholera in 1832. Dysentery was also unknown until 1826. It then made its appearance in the neighborhood of Brownsville, in this county, and was called the bloody flux. We had many cases in Newark in the fall of this year, and it prevailed with great violence the following summer, and was at- tended with greater fatality throughout the summer than any other disease has ever been. \"Puerperal fever was frequent about this time \u2014 1825-28. 24 Perhaps more women died from this cause, than at any other time, before or since. \"Scarlatina was unknown in Newark until i83r. The first case was a boy in the family of the late Lucius Smith, who then lived in a brick house since used for the Baltimore & Ohio rail road depot. The disease soon became a severe scourge and many children died with it. \"Consumption, I think, was less common in early times than at present, and was confined to families with a hereditary taint. \"What has been said about diseases in Newark will apply equally to other portions of the county, except the highlands, where intermittents were less prevalent. In the northwestern portion of the county milk sickness was not uncommon, and a number of deaths were caused by it. It continued to prevail at irregular intervals until 1835. \"The first physician in Newark, as far as I am able to learn, was a Dr. Allen. He came from New York with a Mr. Rath bone, a land agent. He left a few years after Dr. Brice settled here. There was a Dr. Ager in Granville, in an early day, but he soon retired from business. \"Dr. Handley practiced medicine here in^8oo-ro. He was from the east. \"Dr. Noah Harris came here probably in 1808, and was mar ried in 1810. Dr. Brice soon formed a partnership with him. He was a good physician and a popular and useful man.\" Medical attention was hard to secure in those days, on account of the sparsity of the population and the condition of the roads. Physicians went altogether on horseback, with their pill bags buck led to the saddle. Wheeled vehicles were first used by the physicians about 1830. Medicines were hard to procure; it took several weeks to get them from eastern cities, and often they were worthless. Peruvian bark, especially, was high in price and often of no value. Drs. Brice and Harris controlled the practice of medicine about Newark for twenty-five years. Most of the early-time physicians of Newark are named in this chapter. Those of a later date, who practiced their profession between the years 1825 and r85o, were Dr. Elisha Cooper, Dr. Dan iel Marble, Dr. Edward Stanbery, Dr. J. N. Wil son, the Drs. Dickinson, father and son, Dr. Z. C. McElroy, and Dr. Thomas H. Roe, all of whom have deceased, except the two last named. Dr. McElroy has been a successful and respectable physician of Zanesville for about thirty years, and also an extensive contributor to the medical peri- odicals of Europe and America. Dr. Roe still de- votes himself to the practice of his profession in Newark and vicinity, making surgery, as he has always done, a specialty. Dr. Cooper was from New Hampshire, Dr. Marble from western New"], [544, "H^TORY OF LICKINGCOUNTY'. 534 York, Dr. Stanbery from Zanesville, and the Dick insons from England. They were respectable and successful practitioners, as was also Dr. J. N. Wil son, of whom a full biographical sketch is given in connection with the genealogy of the Wilsons. Among those most prominent of a later day. were Drs. J. H. Hamill, A. Barrows, L. T. Ballou, J. R. Black, B. F. Spencer, and others, most of whose names will be found among the members of the Licking County Medical society, given else where in this history. Of the foregoing all are living and in full practice, except Dr. Ballou, of whom an extended biographical sketch is given elsewhere in this volume. Dr. Black has been a voluminous writer on subjects chiefly bearing on hygiene and medical science generally. His work entitled \"Ten Laws of Health,\" and his contribu tions to scientific journals, and to the annual pub. lications of the \"American Health association\" of which he is a member, have met with a good de gree of public favor.

TN the two previous chapters on this township, J- an effort has been made to impress upon the mind a picture of the country as it appeared just prior to its occupation by the white-race, and this picture, it will be perceived, was not a flattering one, though believed to be a faithful one. The picture was beautiful to the eye, the surface was diversified and lovely, but beneath that surface lurked the savage, the wild animal, the venomous reptile and the malarial poison that insidiously and stealthily attacked the vital powers of the pioneers. All these in addition to the dense forest were to be conquered and put out of the way. This was done but it cost many lives, like the fighting of any other great battle. Up to the year 1801, no white settlement existed within the limits of the township. A few settlers were in the Licking valley, and the Staddens had erected their cabin, and settled very near its east- ern line. It was up the Licking valley, from the direction of Zanesville, that the first settlers came, over roads of their own construction. During the year 1801, four families settled within the limits of this township, and the record does not show which of these came first. One of these was Samuel Parr, who settled in the Licking valley, just below the junction of the North and South forks, and first above the Staddens, on what was afterward known as the \"Miller\" farm. James Macauly and James Danner located near the mouth of the Ramp creek, in the southern part of the township, where the first named built a \"tub mill\" or \"corn cracker,\" the first water-power concern within the present limits of the county. There were other settlers, also, in this year, on Ramp creek, not far from its mouth. These were Phineas and Fred erick Ford, and Benoni Benjamin. Phineas Ford settled in Union township; Frederick very near the present line between Union and Newark town ships, but Benjamin settled within the limits of Newark township, near where the canal seeder crosses Ramp creek. It is believed these four"], [545, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 535 families constituted the entire population of this township in 1801. In 1802, however, immigrants came in greater numbers, and from this time for- ward there was a steady stream of immigration. The most important arrival in this year was that of General William C. Schenck, who laid out the town of Newark, calling it after his native place, New- ark, New Jersey. This territory was then in Fair- field county, and continued so until 1808. Hon. William C. Schenck was an early emigrant to the Miami valley, where he was a large land- holder. He and Daniel C Cooper were proprietors of the town of Franklin, in Warren county, Ohio, situated on the Big Miami river, which they laid out in 1795. There Mr. Schenck resided and some of his descendants are yet living in that vicinity. In 1799 Mr. Schenck was chosen secretary of the first council of the Northwest Territory, and served also at the second, and probably the third and last sessions. In 1803 he was elected a member of the first senate of Ohio, serving two years. In 1820 he was elected a member of the house of representa- tives of Ohio, and died at Columbus during his term of service, January, 1821. He was a man of \u2022character, ability and enterprise, and greatly esteemed by his fellow pioneers of the Miami val- ley. He was father of Rear Admiral James F. Schenck, of the United States navy, and of Gen- eral Robert C. Schenck, who is known to the whole country as an old time member of Congress, a Union general and a minister to foreign courts. William C. Schenck was an officer in General Harrison's army in the War of r8i2, and was best known as General Schenck. He was a true patriot, a gallant soldier, and was conspicuous for heroism in the heroic age of the great northwest. He became part owner of section four in this township, his partners being G. W. Burnet and John N. Cummins; and being a practical surveyor, came over here from Warren county to survey their land and ascertain its exact location. He brought with him the plats of the surveys of this and the adjoining townships, and boarded with Isaac Stad- den, while engaged in his work. He was soon able to inform the settlers here, who were the owners of the land. No one in what is now Lick- ing county, in 1801, was living on his own land except John Van Buskirk; all the rest were squatters. After locating their land, it appeared to these men that the forks of the Licking was a good place for a town, and Newark was accordingly platted. The surveying was done by a well known early settler, Samuel H. Smith. The following is a copy of the original record: \"In conformity to a law of the territory northwest of the Ohio, now in force, this plat and description of the town of Newark is made for the purpose of being recorded. ' ' The town is laid out in blocks or squares of twenty -five perches, each block is subdivided into lots, and has an alley one pole wide, running through the center each way, and crossing at right angles. Each lot contains seventy-two square poles, and is six perches in breadth, and twelve in length. Main street is eight poles wide, the other streets are each six poles wide. The common or public ground may be appropriated to county purposes by consent of two-thirds of the inhabitants of the town, and not otherwise, excepting one hundred and forty four square poles in the centre of said public ground, which is given for county or State purposes, to be applied to no other purposes whatever. \"The ground between Front street and the river, all the streets and alleys and the public grounds, except as before ex cepted, are given perpetually for the use of the inhabitants of the town of Newark. \"The course of Main street is south sixty-five degrees west, and vice versa, and the other streets run at right angles from it except East and West streets which run parallel with it- The out-lots are twenty-six poles square, and contain four acres and thirty-six perches, and between every two tiers of out-lots is an alley two poles wide.

Cummins and John Burnet. \"Fairfield county, S.S.: Before me Joseph Vandorn, one of the justices of the afore said county, personally came William C.

To the Recorder of Fairfield county, Newark, eighteenth March, 1803: I hereby certify the foregoing to be a correct copy, as taken from the transcribed records of this office. I. W. Bigelow, Recorder. In addition to the names on the above record, the following constituted the entire number of in habitants then in Newark township, so far as can be astertained: Mrs. Catharine Pegg, Abraham Miller, James Macauley, Benoni Benjamin, James Danner, James Jeffries and Beall Babbs. In October of this year (1802) quite a little col ony came from Washington county, Pennsylvania, and settled in Newark and Cherry valley. These were Abraham Johnson, Abraham Wright, Will iam B. Gaw, James Petticord, Edward Nash, Carlton Belt, Benedict Belt, Acquilla Belt, Little John Belt, Black John Belt. These Belts were also joined in a few years by Long John Belt. In the winter of 1802-3 James Petticord and Little John Belt began the erection of a mill which became the Buskirk mill in 1804. John Van Buskirk run this mill more than thirty years. To the names above may be added that of John War den who, with Abraham Miller and Henry Clay baugh, came from the south branch of the Poto mac, settling in the vicinity of Newark \u2014 Warden near the east line of the township. The first sale of lands in this township occurred May 20, 1802, and was made by Messrs. Schenck, Cummins and Burnet, to John Warden, who pur chased two hundred and eighty-five acres of land on the east side of section four. On the same day the same party sold to Anthony Miller three hun dred and fifteen acres of land adjoining Warden's. Both of these deeds were acknowleged before Isaac Stadden, then justice of the peace. The city was laid out in the spring of 1802, though the plat of the same was not recorded until March, 1803. The original plat and much of the present city is enclosed on three sides by the North, South and Raccoon forks of Licking river. It is situated on a beautiful, level plateau of sandy loam, the original plat extending from Front street along the North fork on the east to Fifth street on the west, and from Walnut street on the south to Lo cust on the north. It is a square of which the public square is the center. Its surveyors had lit tle regard for points of the compass, the streets in the original plat running at a right angle with the North fork, which here bears northwest and south east. It is very evident that General Schenck was a liberal minded gentleman, from his manner of lay ing out this town. Its very broad streets and am ple public square testify to this. His views were broader than those of others who have since made additions to the place, as nearly all the streets out side of the original plat are cut down to ordinary, and some even less than ordinary width. Many additions have been made from time to time, the growth of the city having been mainly west and north. The first sale of lots was to James Jeffries, who purchased out-lot number three and in-lot number fifty-nine. The first cabin was erected by James Black, on lot eighty, where the Park house now stands, and was used as a hotel. It was the first in the new town, and was called \"Black's tavern.\" About the same time Samuel Parr erected a cabin on lot seventy-three (the Culley lot), now occupied by Kellar's livery stable. Samuel Elliott built the first hewed-log house. It stood on lot seventy-nine, where Mrs. Fullerton now resides. Beall Babbs .built on lot seventy-eight, where Matthew Newkirk now lives. Mrs. Catharine Pegg erected a cabin on the lot afterward occupied by the Episcopal rectory, but now the property of Mrs. Blandy. These were probably all the buildings erected in Newark in i'8o2; and all were built after July and before October. It is rather difficult to follow closely the settle ments after 1802, as the settlers came in rapidly from that time forward. In the summer of 1803 Rev. John Wright visited the place for the first time. He was a Presbyterian minister and the second one of that denomination to visit the place \u2014 Mr. Me Donald being the first. His brief experi-"], [547, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 537 ence will enable one to form an opinion regarding the then little hamlet in the wilderness. He arrived on a Saturday afternoon, and learning that there was but one Presbyterian in the place, and being unwilling to intrude upon him, as he was in very humble circumstances, he concluded to stop at Black's tavern, the only place of entertainment in town. The proprietor informed him that it would be necessary for him to sleep on the floor, as his sleeping apartments, which were not numerous nor spacious, were occupied by persons who were at- tending a horse-race. This, Mr. Wright readily consented to do. On the following day (Sunday) arrangements were made for a repetition of the race, which had not terminated very satisfactorily on Saturday. Though during the forenoon of that Sabbath the chief interest of the little community was cen- tered in that horse-race, Mr. Wright preached, and held a second service in the afternoon, at which he preached a sermon on the \"observance of the Sabbath,\" to an audience largely composed of those who had attended the horse-race. At the close of this service one of his hearers arose and said the preacher had told them the truth, and proposed that a collection be taken up for him. The hat being passed around seven dol- lars was contributed A story was afterward published in connection with this visit of Mr. Wright, to the effect that about the middle of the night of Saturday he was aroused by a gang of drunken roughs, who swore that as a stranger he must stand treat or be ducked under a pump near by, but that he escaped and spent the remainder of the night with his Presby- terian brother. The truth of this is doubted. John Warden has been mentioned among the settlers in Newark in 1802. He succeeded Isaac Stadden in the office of justice of the peace, and was the first office-holder within the limits of New- ark township. Isaac Stadden has been mentioned by some authorities as a resident of this township, but this is an error; he resided in Madison town- ship, very near the east line of Newark township. Abraham Miller, who came with Warden, raised a crop here in 1802, and then, in the fall of that year, returned to the south branch of the Potomac and married, returning with his wife in the spring of 1803. He became a permanent settler on the first farm east of Newark; John Warden occupy- ing the second one. Mrs. Sarah Haughey, daughter of Abraham Johnson, was born in December, 1802, in Newark, and is now the oldest living native in the town. Nancy Cunningham, wife of John Cunningham, and daughter of David Lewis, born October, 1803, is the next oldest. She is yet living, in good health, on Mt. Vernon street. These two old ladies have noted the mighty changes of more than three-fourths of a century in this one spot. Patrick Cunningham was born in Tyrone county, Province of Ulster, Ireland, and came to the Licking valley in 1801, settling near the cabin of John Jones, on the Munson farm, in Granville township. He built the second cabin in that township. In 1803 he removed to Newark, where he became quite a character. His nephew, John Cunningham, who married the second white child born in the town, above mentioned, is yet living on Mt. Vernon street. From 1 80 1 to 18 10, Newark barely had an existence, containing a score or two log cabins, erected in the midst of a great forest, but upon the ruins of an ancient city of the Mound Build- ers. Black's \"tavern\" was a log building, on the east side of the frog pond, now known as the public square. It was, probably, the most impor- tant building in the place, standing high and dry on an elevated piece of ground, which has since been leveled. Whether this elevation was an arti- ficial one the record does not say. Some years afterwards this log building was replaced by a brick, which was painted a bright green color, and was called the \"Green tavern.\" That build- ing in turn gave way to the present substantial one. It has, in all these years, changed hands many times. Some of its early landlords were, James Black, James Taylor, Thomas Taylor, Major Hus- ton, Willard Warner, G. C. Harrington, and others. \"Taverns\" were busy places in those days. Im- migrants came rapidly and they were all hungry and dry; consequently the little log taverns were generally \"packed\" at night and the bar, inseper able from the business of hotel keeping, was well patronized. They were often noisy places, people in their neighborhood resorting to them for the"], [548, "533 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. purposes of drinking, frolicking, wrestling, pitching quoits, and often fighting. A specimen of a coun try tavern was located about half way between Newark and Granville in an early day, called the \"Tar tavern.\" It was the half-way house for sleighing parties, and travelers from one town to the other. Some of the performances at the Tar tavern were not always creditable to those en gaged, but this class of houses has long since dis appeared. Every tavern had its sign, an article considered of great importance. Something must be painted upon it that would attract attention; in this they took lessons from across the water, following closely the habit of the English inn. George Washing ton's head frequently appeared on tavern signs, as well as that of General Wayne and other noted people, while horses, dogs, and every species of animal and bird were frequently painted in the brightest colors, life size, framed and swung to the breeze on creaking iron hinges. This sign was generally fastened to the top of a large post which stood in front of the tavern door, and served as a hitching post. The second hotel in Newark was started by Abraham Johnson, in 1803. It was a log building and stood on the corner of Church and Third streets, immediately in rear of what is now the Lansing house. This house was also kept by Mr. Spellman, and was subsequently purchased by Will iam Trindle, and called the \"Ohio house.\" The present brick building was erected for and used some years as a hotel. It was called the \"Green Tree\" house, having a tree painted on the sign. The third hotel was erected by Maurice New man, who came to Newark in 1804. It stood on second street, facing the square, on the site of the residence of the late S. D. King. The fourth was the \"Cully\" or \"Black Horse\" tavern, started about 1807, by John Cully, in the log house built by Samuel Parr, in 1802. This was, probably, the most popular of the early tav erns; the most prominent thing about it being the sign, upon which was painted a black horse. It is hard to say what made the place popular, as it always appeared to be a tumble down old rookery, and its outward appearance was anything but invit ing, but Cully seemed to be a favorite with the traveling public and the place was well patronized. The north end of the building was two stories in height, the upper story being fitted up as a lodging room for guests. This was called the \"potter's field,\" a place where everybody slept. This tavern stood opposite the Park house, on the site of Kel- lar's livery stable. About 1812 or 181 4, Colonel William H. Gault came and erected a hotel on the south side of the square. The sign of the tavern was a big bell, and it was called the \"Bell tavern.\" By this time and for some years before, VanBuskirk's saw-mill had been at work, and lumber could be procured for building purposes. Gault's tavern was frame, or it was at least weather-boarded. Subsequently this was torn down and a brick erected on the spot for the same purpose, which in turn gave way to the present edifice, called Shield's block. Gault was an ambitious, stirring business man, and occu- pied the positions of county commissioner, sheriff, auditor, and also represented the county in both branches of the legislature at different times. Dr. J. N. Wilson speaks thus of Newark in 1810: \"We had at that time several log houses, as well as some frame ones, but so scattered as to give but a faint idea of the shape and form of a town. These houses stood mostly north and northeast of the square. Scarcely could there be found in. the town one hundred yards square without a pond or pool of water, standing most of the year. An ugly swamp was then in existence just north of Church street, along Fourth, with a gully running down by the corner of Church and Third streets, to near the southwest corner of the square, with a large pond just northeast of the old wooden jail which stood there in the center of the square. This large pond remained for a dwelling place for frogs, and a resort for ducks and geese, in some de- gree, as late as 1837.\" Mrs. Haughey says the old jail above mentioned stood near the south side of the present park, and was a squatty, round-log building, though two sto- ries in height. The jailor, Adam Hatfield, lived in the lower part, and the prisoners were kept in the upper part. It was probably erected about or after 1808. She remembers that the whipping- post was brought into requisition at one time. A man by the name of Courson was bound to the post, which stood near the jail, and whipped by a man named Zeigler, who was employed for that purpose. This punishment was meted out to Courson for stealing a sack of wheat from the Van Buskirk mill. All the citizens of the town wit-"], [549, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 539 nessed the performance, the children being allowed the place of honor inside the ring formed around the post, the women being next, and the men around the outside. She says the VanBuskirk mill was a log concern, and not much of a mill at the beginning. The Indians had an encampment a short distance be yond the mill, and were to be seen in town every day. They frequently got drunk and made trouble. This VanBuskirk mill was rebuilt about 1830; the present frame structure was then erected by Bradley Buckingham, who was among the ear liest merchants of Newark, and a man of wealth. He was probably a partner, at that time, of the VanBuskirk's. This mill always did a large busi ness, and was run exclusively by water-power until two or three years ago, yvhen steam was added. It is now owned by Mr. Montgomery. In addition to the old jail the square contained another building of great importance to the pioneers, this was the first court house, probably erected in 1809 or 1 8 10. It was a hewed-log building, and was said to contain but one room, with no floor for some time after it was erected, and the seats were slabs, laid upon logs. In this building, which stood just north of the present building, were held the first meetings of the settlers. Probably the first schools were taught here and the first religious meetings held \u2014 or at least among the first. No doubt the earliest religious meetings were held in the open air and in the cabins of the pioneers. Among the first school-teachers were James Maxwell, who came with John Larabee in 1801, to the Licking valley; Archibald Wilson, jr., Samuel English and a Mr. Mills. Maxwell was somewhat noted as a song singer. It is said he could sing a different song for each day in the year. He was elected the first constable in this territory in Janu ary, 1 80 2, and made school-teaching his business. He married a daughter of Elias Hughes. One of the first schools was taught by Archibald Wilson, jr., on the south side of the square, in a cabin that had been used as a dwelling; and another by Samuel English near the Gault tavern. The first house erected for a school-house was a log building on the corner of Main and Fourth streets. A grocery now occupies the corner. Hostner Curtis was one of the early teachers in this house. Later, Mr. Mills taught school on Church street, just west of the Second Presbyterian church, in a cabin that had been used as a dwell ing. John Johnson, the two Mrs. Haugheys and John Cunningham were pupils here at one time. Mrs. Haughey remembers attending school about one and a half miles north of the town on Mt. Vernon road, in a cabin erected for a school house; probably the first erected in this vicinity. She thinks this antedates the one erected in town. The railroad now passes over the spot where this building stood. Later, between 1815 and 1820, Rev. Thomas Baird was an efficient teacher here. His school was in the Newman tavern. Prior to 1848, the schools of Newark, as of other towns in Ohio, were in a rudimentary condition. It would seem that less progress was made in this most important branch of civilization than any other, and this, perhaps, the most important of all. For years after the first settlement of the county, the only schools were \"subscription\" schools, which were established in some deserted cabin or barn, by some individual who considered himself competent, without preparation or examination, and constituted himself a committee of one to estab lish a school and keep it (not teach it) according to his own benighted ideas. There were certainly exceptions; some of the teachers were competent and educated, but the majority were not; and there was a time, probably within the memory of the \"oldest inhabitant,\" when there was no such thing as public money for school purposes; hence, if the pioneers attempted to educate their children they must send them to one of these \" select \" schools and pay the tuition out of their own pock ets to the teachers. This tuition usually amounted to two or three dollars per scholar for a term of three months. The would-be teacher went around with a paper, to which those who desired his ser vices would attach their names, with the amount to be paid set opposite. This amount was collect ed by the teacher himself during and at the close of the term. When public funds were obtainable for school purposes, there was a little improvement in the schools. School-houses were erected, teachers hired, who were required to present to the directors a certificate of qualification, and the schools were"], [550, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 54\u00b0 regularly maintained a certain portion of every year \u2014 usually three or four months in the summer and the same time in the winter. This system of teaching was universal, and continued with little improvement nearly half a century, and the greater number of the great men of the State and Nation received the rudiments of their education, and all the education they ever received inside of a school-house, from this system of teaching. February 5, 1825, the general assembly passed an act empowering the school board to levy a tax of one-half mill on the dollar to be appropriated to the use of common schools. All the funds coming into the hands of the school board, other than these, were raised by direct taxation, and authorized only by a majority of the qualified voters within the district limits. When these funds were exhausted the schools were closed. The teachers were poorly paid, and, according to the general custom, \"boarded round.\" All the chil dren within the district limits between the ages of four and twenty-one years, were privileged to at tend these schools. The branches taught were reading, spelling, writing, arithmetic, and further along, English grammar. Later still, philosophy, algebra, and other branches of study were intro duced. Newark, probably, made greater effort to estab lish good schools than most other towns of its size. This was, probably, owing somewhat to the fact of the early establishment of Granville college; New ark did not like to be outdone in this respect by her sister town. In 1837 or 1838, a Miss Stimp son established the \"Newark seminary for young ladies.\" This was worthy to be called a \"select\" school. And at the same time the \"Newark high school\" was opened for the reception of pupils, being conducted by Mr. R. K. Nash, and con trolled by a board of trustees composed of Asa Beckwith, A. Brown, E. S. Woods, James Young, and George M. Young. The tuition fees were, reading, writing and arithmetic, six dollars per term of twenty-two weeks; English grammar and the higher branches of mathematics, eight dollars per term, and the languages ten dollars. The school-room was over A. Beckwith's store. This school was continued during 1839, under the superintendence of Messrs. Smith and Cochran. In 1848 an important change occurred. The schools were reorganized under what is known as the \"Akron law,\" which is the foundation of the present school system in the State. At a meeting of the teachers and others inter ested in education, held in the First Presbytetian church of Newark, February 28, 1848, it was re solved to organize into what was called \"The Edu cational society of Newark township,\" and to in vite all others interested, to co-operate with them. At this meeting, a committee, consisting of A. W. Dennis, Isaac Smucker, and L. P. Coman, was appointed to draft resolutions. This committee reported the following, which were unanimously adopted: \"Resolved, That in our opinion teachers\" institutes are the most efficient means of improving the teachers, and through them the common schools of the State, and the best calculated to render the profession of school-teaching more elevating and dignified. \"Resolved, That we heartily respond to the arrangement made by the executive committee of the State Teachers' associ ation, to hold a teachers' institute in this county commencing on the twenty-seventh of March next, that we will procure a suitable building, and provide means toward defraying the ex penses of the session, and we earnestly solicit teachers and friends of education in other townships in the county to co operate with us in this matter, and that a committee be ap pointed to make arrangements for holding the institute in the town of Newark.\" After the adoption of resolutions and the trans action of other business, the following gentlemen were chosen officers of the society : Rev. Alex ander Duncan, president; Rev. George Dennison, and Isaac Smucker, vice-presidents, and C. P. Wilder, secretary. As a result of this movement, the institute which followed, March 27, was well attended, and characterized by a lively interest in the cause of public schools. Mr. M. F. Cowdry, president of the executive committee of the State Teachers' association, and Mr. Lorin Andrews, served in the capacity of lecturers during the week of the insti tute, at the close of yyhich a series of fifteen reso lutions was adopted, setting forth the opinion of those in attendance, looking toward a more effi cient system of public scools, a more thorough preparation of teachers, and a wider range in the course of studies. At a meeting of the citizens interested in com mon schools, held at the auditor's office, July n,"], [551, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 54i 1848, a committee of twelve was appointed to circulate a petition to the town council for the pur- pose of securing signatures of such of the quali- fied voters as were in favor of extending the provisions of the Akron law to this town. This petition received about four hundred and fifty signatures, almost a unanimous consent of the voters then within the corporation. July 20th a notice was issued by the mayor, A. H. Caffee, that an election would be held August 1 2th following, for the purpose of electing six school directors for the town, in conformity with an act amendatory to the Akron school law, and applicable to this town. This election resulted in the choice of Israel Dille, Isaac Smucker, Samuel D. King, Adam Fleek, Abner W. Dennis and Joshua Gibbs as the first school board of New- ark, under the organization of the graded plan. The organization was further perfected at a meet- ing held August 16th, at which the oath of office was administered by Samuel H. Bancroft, a justice of the peace, and the following members were chosen officers of the board: Samuel D. King, president; A. W. Dennis, secretary; and Adam Fleek, treasurer. A. W. Dennis and Israel Dille were appointed a committee of correspondence. Messrs. Dille, Smucker and Gibbs were appointed a committee to procure rooms suitable for school purposes; divide the town into districts for primary schools; learn what number of pupils would want instruction in the higher branches, and make such other arrangements for the year as the schools might require. Correspondence was opened at once with school officers at Lockport and Utica, New York, Akron, Ohio, and others in different parts of the country. The town council was notified to appoint school examiners, as required by law, and Messrs. Dille and Dennis were appointed a committe to draft rules and regulations for the government of school boards and schools. The following notice was inserted in the Licking Herald of November 3, 1 S48 : \"Candidates for the office of teacher, under the supervision of the Board of Education of the town of Newark, are hereby notified that an examination of such candidates will be holden at ten o'clock A. M., on Wednesday, the eighth instant, in the basement of the Episcopal church. \"The examination will be conducted orally in part, and partly by use of written questions, to which written answers will be required. \"By order of the Board of Education, J. Buckingham, Secretary.\" November 16, 1848, the committee appointed to rent rooms for the use of schools organized on the graded plan, reported the following, which was accepted: \"School-house in rear of the First Presbyterian church, at one hundred dollars a year; room in the basement of the Methodist church, on Fourth street, at four dollars a month ; room in the base ment of, the Episcopal church, at four dollars a month; school-room in rear of the Welsh church, at three dollars a month; house owned by Joel Arnold, corner of Fifth and Main streets, at one and one-half dollars a month; house of Israel Dille, on East Main street, at three dollars per month ; two rooms in front of the Franklin house, east side of public square, at five dollars a month ; room of A. J. Smith, in Appolo building, at twen ty-five dollars a year; also two small buildings for merly used as school-houses, one on Walnut street, and the other in East Newark. The same com mittee also reported that the furniture and stoves necessary to furnish the rooms would probably cost one hundred and fifty dollars.\" Thus it was that the graded schools of Newark came into existence. The following is the corps of teachers employed and the salary of each: L. P. Coman, superin tendent of all the schools and principal of the high school, salary six hundred dollars; L. W. Gilbert, first assistant, salary twenty-six dollars a month ; Miss Sophronia Hines, salary twenty-two dollars a month; Miss Cornelia Curtis, sixteen dollars a month; J. C. Miller, first assistant in the secondary department, salary twenty-four dollars a month; Miss Susan Bushnell, Miss Caroline Carter, Miss Amelia L Ellis and Miss Caroline Seymour, in secondary department, salary sixteen dollars a month each; Miss Elizabeth Morgan, Miss Sophia Carter, Miss Mary Dunham and Miss Lydia M. Little, in the primary department, salary sixteen dollars a month each. September 18, 1849, trie board of education adopted a complete course of studies, the schools having previously been named and classified with respect to time as follows:"], [552, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 542 effected a classification of scholars, and better understand their wants, they are of opinion that the interests of the schools re quire that a central school-house be first erected for the accom modation of the secondary and high school scholars. ' ' When the town is supplied with suitable and well arranged school-houses, the board confidently believe that our public schools may be made equal to any schools in the State, either select or public, that the youth may be educated at much less expense in public than select schools, and that a large amount of money heretofore sent to other towns, for educational pur poses, will be retained here for the Improvement of our town, and for the benefit of common schools. \"Although the board have had an arduous duty to perform in organizing and classifying the several schools, they take plea sure in stating that the success of our common schools during the year may, in a measure, be ascribed to the common sense liberality of the citizens of Newark, for the last of which no better evidence need be required than that they contributed from private sources nearly twelve hundred dollars for the sup port of the public schools.\" At the regular meeting in May, 1850, the board entered into contract with Messrs. H. Rogers and S. Ferguson for the erection of what is known as the Central school building on Church street, at a cost of twelve thousand dollars. Said building was to be two stories high, eighty feet long and sixty feet wide; to contain two school-rooms in basement, eight school-rooms, one office and one recitation room in the superstructure, and to be ready for occupancy at the opening of the schools in the fall of 1851. In 1854 the capacity of the central building not being sufficient for the accom modation of the pupils then in the schools, a third story, containing four school-rooms, and one rec itation room was added to it. Since the erection of this building, substantial two-story primary buildings were erected in East, South and West Newark. A handsome two-story building, containing ample corridors, one office and eight well arranged and furnished school rooms, with cloak-rooms connected, and all warmed with steam heating apparatus, was completed in September, 1875, m North Newark. The following is a tabular form of the more im portant statistics since 1855, showing the growth and improvement of the schools, and the increase of funds expended for their support : 1855. 1865. r875. 1880. Number of pupils enumerated 1,400 1,927 3,379 \"Primary school embracing four years; secondary school em bracing four years, and high school embracing four years. The course of studies for the primary and secondary grades embraced all the common branches, and natural history the last year of the secondary course, making this the preparatory year for admission into the high school. The high school course in cluded English grammar, composition, vocal music, rhetoric, botany, United States history, mental philosophy, logic, book keeping, higher arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, chemistry, geology, Greek and Latin.\" The following is taken from the first annual re port of the board of education, after its organiza tion under the Akron law, to the council, for the years 1848-9, dated February 19, 1850: \"During the first quarter, twelve schools were taught, consist ing of six primary, four secondary and two departments of the high school, male and female. In these schools fourteen teach ers were employed, including the superintendent, three male and eleven female. During the second quarter the same num ber of schools were taught, and thirteen teachers were employed, the services of the assistant female teacher in the female depart ment of the high school having been dispensed with on the ground that an assistant teacher in this school was not abso lutely necessary. \"The number of scholars enrolled during the winter quarter was three hundred and ninety-five males and three hundred and twenty-seven females; total seven hundred and twenty-two. The average daily attendance was two hundred and eighty-four males and two hundred and forty females. The number en rolled during the summer quarter was two hundred and twenty nine males and two hundred and seventy-five females. The average daily attendance was one hundred and forty-two males and one hundred and ninety-two females. \"Amount collected from common school fund, United States military fund, county duplicates, delinquent school-house tax, and all other sources, two thousand nine hundred and thir ty-one dollars, eighty-three cents and three mills; amount paid teachers, for rent, for fuel, foi furniture and other miscella-* neous items, two thousand eight hundred and fifty-eight dollars and fifty-two cents; balance in treasury, seventy-three dollars thirty-one cents and three mills. \"The most serious difficulty the board had to encounter dur ing the year was the want of suitable school rooms, as they were under the necessity of relying solely on the rent of such rooms as could be obtained. Many of them are inconvenient as to location, unpleasant, and in many instances uncomforta ble. Another difficulty was the classification of the scholars. When the town is supplied with convenient and well arranged school-houses, this important part of our schools may be im proved. \"As the whole amount of school fund accruing to the town, under the general school law, and received into the treasury, was deemed insufficient to keep up the schools nine months in the year, the board was under the necessity of making an as sessment for this purpose on each scholar whose parents or guardians were considered able to pay, taking special care not to exclude any who were justly entitled to free admission. \"As to the erection of a new building, it was first supposed that six or more primary school-houses, located in different parts of the town, would be first needed, but since they have port of the public schools.\" Number of pupils enrolled 820 1,178 1,563 1,812 Average daily attendance 540 629 1,037 x<213 Number of teachers 17 20 32 40 Number of school-rooms 13 14 30 38 Number of weeks in session 36 36 38 38"], [553, "HISTORY FO LICKING COUNTY. 543 The amount paid teachers in 1849 was $2,057; in 1875, $12,593; in 1880, $17,006.82.

It was started in 1820, by Mr, Benjamin Briggs, of Fayette county, Pennsylvania. He continued its publication until August, 1856, a period of thirty six years, when he sold it to Mr. W. D. Morgan. Mr. Morgan conducted it until January, 1865, when he transferred it to Mr. Lewis Glessner, who published it until April, 1866. Mr. W. W. Kings bury became owner at this latter date, and remained sole proprietor until April, 1867, when he formed a partnership with W. D. Morgan, one of its former conductors. Mr. Kingsbury died in Sep tember, 1875, and the paper was continued by Mr. Morgan alone untii March 10, 1880, when it was purchased by the present proprietor, J. A. Caldwell. The Advocate supported Henry Clay for presi dent in 1824; General Jackson in r828 and 1832; Martin Van Buren in 1836 and 1840; James K. Polk in 1844; Lewis Cass in 1848; Franklin Pierce in 1852; James Buchanan in 1856; John C. Breckenridge in 1860; General George B. Mc- Clellan in 1864 ; Horatio Seymour in 1868 ; Horace Greely in 1872; Samuel J. Tilden in 1876, and Winfield S. Hancock in 1880. It has been pub- shed sixty years, and has been consistent as well as persistent in its advocacy of Democratic princi ples and in its support of Democratic candidates. Its first editor, Mr. Briggs, was a clear, forcible writer, much given to the use of strong Saxon words that vigorously expressed his ideas, and he never wrote without having ideas to convey. He wrote carefully, slowly, scarcely with ordinary facil ity, but his manuscripts were remarkably correct as to orthography, and were short, generally amount ing to less than a column. It was his practice to put his editorials (especially the shorter ones) in type without writing them. When he chose to be vituperative he generally succeeded. During his long residence in Newark he was a prominent citi zen, and was identified with every project that tended to the advancement and welfare of the place and its people. He held various public trusts, being elected mayor of the city, and to both branches of the State legislature; he was also postmaster some years. Upon retiring from edi torial life he removed to Washington city, where he spent several years. Death overtook him in his sixty-eighth year. The second paper started in Newark was called the Newark Gazette. Its first issue was by Rufus Henry & Company, late in 1827, and it was devoted to the advocacy of the election of John Quincy Adams to the Presidency. Dr. Daniel Marble was the company; he edited the paper and Mr. Henry printed it. In 1837 Mr. Clark Dunham became proprietor and remained such about ten years, ex cept during the year 1841, when George M. Young and Samuel White were editors and proprietors. Messrs. George P. Conrad and William Richards succeeded Mr. Dunham about 1847. In Michael P. Brister purchased the Gazette and changed its name to the Newark Times. He de voted it to Americanism a year or two, and sold it, in 1855, to A. W. Stevens, who changed its name to the ATorth American, and published it as a Re publican paper about three years and then sold it to S. G Arnold. W. C. Gray and M. L. Wilson continued the paper as the True America?i in 1863 and 1864. In 1865 McAdam & Lee bought it. About a year after Major Caffrey and Dr. T. B. Hood became the owners. Hood soon retired, and, in 1868, the concern was purchased by M. L. Wilson and A. B. Clark. During the following year Henry I. King purchased Mr. Wilson's inter est, and Mr. Clark, in turn, purchased Mr. King's interest in 1873. The latter conducted the paper about one year alone. In March, 1874, Mr. I. N. Underwood, an old and experienced newspaper man, purchased a half interest in the concern. The Newark Gazette was the organ of the Whig party in this county, and as such supported Henry Clay for President in 1832; General Harrison in 1836 and 1840; issuing, in addition, the Harriso nian in 1840, and the Kickapoo in 1844, as cam paign papers, both in the interest of General Har rison. They were made up principally of the Gazette editorials. In T844 the Gazette advocated the election of Henry Clay again; General Taylor in 1848, and General Scott in 1852. Soon after this the Whig party expired, and the successor of"], [554, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 544 the Newark Gazette, being now called the North American, sustained the candidate of the Republi can party, Colonel J. C. Fremont, for President. The Newark American has since been the organ of the Republican party here, supporting all the Re publican candidates for the Presidency since the organization of that party. Under its present management it is, probably, the best conducted and most ably edited county paper in central Ohio. The Constitutionalist was the next paper started in Newark. The first number was issued in 1837, by Rankin & Stadden, and supported the Demo cratic doctrines. Colonel William Spencer, Colo nel Boring, W. P. Morrison, and John R. Petit were, at different times, associate proprietors with Stadden after Rankins' death in 1840, until late in 1843, and Abijah Baker and Messrs. George H. and C. B. Flood took a hand in the editorial man agement of it. A campaign paper called the'Fasp was issued in 1840 from the Constitutionalist office. Both pa pers advocated the re-election of Martin Van Buren to the Presidency. About 1842 a paper was issued from the Gazette office, called The Laborer; it was edited by James Sloan, and advocated protective tariff notions. It lived about three months. Late in 1843, Mr. Jacob Glessner purchased the Constitutionalist and changed its name to the Lick ing Herald. He remained the sole proprietor, supporting James K. Polk for President in 1844, until 1848, when he sold out to J. C. Springer. In T850, Messrs. Harvey C. Blackman & Company bought it and supported Franklin Pierce for Presi dent in 1852. Soon after the election a Mr. Col burn owned it awhile. William Parr was proprie tor in 1853, and E. J. Ellis then conducted it, except during a brief interval in 1856. Mr. Bris tor having disposed of the Times bought the Her ald of Mr. Ellis, changed the name to the Newark Times and published it as a Democratic paper a few months, flying the flag of James Buchanan for President. Mr. Brister's death occurred before the election, but the Times was continued as a neutral or independent paper, devoted to news, miscellany and reform, by Mrs. Brister. It was discontinued in 1859. The Oriental Evanic was started in 1846. It advocated the principles of the Oriental Evanic order, and, though ably edited, it was short lived. It was the organ of the Newark Evanics, and of the \"Concilium,\" the knighthood branch of the order. The Voice of the People was started as a Douglas paper in 1860, by John H. Putnam, and was a squatter sovereignty advocate until the summer of 1861, when its editor \"went to the wars,\" and his paper was swallowed up by the Advocate. In 1863, Asa L. Harris began the publication of the Licking Record in this city. It was devoted to Republicanism, but was short lived, enduring about a year. In 1862, a campaign paper, styled the True Democrat, was published a few months. It advo cated the election of an independant ticket, put in the field against the regularly nominated Demo cratic ticket. The paper was edited at first by a Mr. Whitely, and at last by Mr. Peter Long. Its ticket was defeated, and the True De?nocrat was discontinued. In 1866, Messrs. Caffrey & Tenney started the Reveille and Woolgrower. Its publication was continued about a year, when it was merged in the Newark American. James White and Dr. Tuller, in 186 1-2 pub lished a small semi-monthly paper called the Sower, at fifty cents a year. It advocated the three lead ing doctrines of the New Church, viz: First, that God is one in essence and in person, and that Je sus Christ is that one: Second, that the word of God is divine wisdom, and, therefore, the eternal fountian of divine truth : Third, that a life, according to this truth, is the way leading to use fulness, which introduces to heaven. The Sower lived a little over a year. It is also worthy of mention that M. L. Wilson, at long intervals, got out an advertising sheetj; sometimes it took the shape of a holiday paper, especially about Christmas and New Years. He also issued a fifty cent paper at intervals of a month or thereabouts^called Papers by the Way. This was made up of the matter of the American. A daily paper was at one time issued in the city for a few months only. It died for want of proper nourishment. Twenty or thirty years ago a paper called the"], [555, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 545 Spy was issued \"semi-occasionally.\" It was devo ted to fun. The Monthly Voice, a Swedenborgian Sunday-school paper was also issued many years ago, by M. L. Wilson. It lived a year or more. The Newark Banner was started April i, 1874, by Milton R. Scott, the present editor and propri etor. It is independent in politics. In 1878, a paper, called the National Advance, was issued by T. O' Donovan. It was a stock con cern and advocated the principles of the National party. About a year later it was purchased by O'Donovan & Kuster, who changed the name to the Newark Democrat, it also became a Demo cratic paper. It was purchased by the proprietor of the Advocate, in the spring of 1880, and dis continued. In the spring of 1880, Rev. O. J. Nave began the issue of the Newark Pastoral, a paper devoted to the interests of the Methodist church. It was discontinued late in 1880. A second attempt has been made to start a daily paper, and the first number of the Newark Morning News was issued June 7, 1880. It was conducted by Charles F. Dutcher until August 9, 1880, when it passed into the hands of Messrs. Stephens & Fant. It is Democratic. In the spring of 1880, it began to dawn upon the Germans that they were in sufficient force in this city and county to sustain a paper printed in their own language; accordingly the first number of the Newa?-k Express made its appearance June 25, 1880. It is Democratic in politics, and is ed ited by F. Kochendorfer, who is also a teacher in the public schools. It will be observed that Newark has, at present, four papers \u2014 one daily and five weeklies, viz: The Advocate, American, Banner, News, and Express. Three of these are Democratic, one Republican, and one independent. CHAPTER LXIII. NEWARK TOWNSHIP AND CITY CONTINUED.

RETURNING to the early settlement of the town and township, it is fouud that the set tlers of 1803 \u2014 in the former, were Robert Sher- wood and, perhaps, one other; and in the latter, on the \"Wilson section,\" Jacob Wrilson and Evan Payne. Sherwood was a native of Ireland, but married and lived some years in Shippensburgh, Pennsylvania, before coming to Newark. He be came owner of a lot on the southeast corner of First and Main streets, where he died in 1822. Wilson and Payne built a cabin on the North fork, but on the east side. Near the \"Big spring,\" close to his cabin, Jacob Wilson stuck into the ground a willow switch he had brought with him from the Alleghany mountains, which grew into"], [556, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 546 he kept store in Newark in 1804. This may be true, and if so, there is little doubt that he was the first merchant. The Wilson family was a large and influential one, and in some respects the most important one among the early settlers. Archibald Wilson, sr., was on the first board of commission ers of this county. He was born in the Shenan doah valley, Virginia. David Moore was born in Adams county, Penn sylvania, April 9, 1774; came to this county in 1808, and died April 30, 1868. One of the \"queer\" characters around Newark in an early day was John Sparks. He was gener ally seen barefooted, walking along the streets and alleys with a fishing-pole on his shoulder, for he was a true disciple of Izaac Walton. He had an overpowering repugnance to labor, and irresistable vagabondizing proclivities. He was born on the South branch of the Potomac in 1758, and when, in 1803, President Jefferson organized an explor ing expedition to cross the continent, he joined it, and thus became a member of the Lewis and Clark expedition; from this fact, alone, he acquired his importance. The expedition started in the spring of 1804, and from their next winter's quarters, on the Missouri river, sent John Sparks back to Washington with dispatches, where he arrived late in the summer, and was honorably discharged. Sparks was vigorous, robust, and adapted to a life of hardship and adventure. He had no fam ily, and lived a sort of haphazard, precarious, hard life, dying in 1846. James Hendricks was one of the pioneers of this county. He came from Brooke county, Virginia, set tling on land which he purchased from his brother in-law, John Van Buskirk. He remained there a few years and removed to Newark, where he died in 1855, at an advanced age. Mr. John Johnston, who died in Newark, March 4, 1875, aged seventy-three years, was the oldest inhabitant of the city at the time. His father re moved with his family from Washington county, Pennsylvania, to Newark in 1802, and never changed his residence. Hon. Frederick Dent, father of Mrs. General Grant, was about 181 2 a merchant in Newark. He died in Washington city, aged eighty-eight years. a large tree and is still flourishing. He returned to Hardy county, Virginia, married in 1804, and returned to the wilderness with his bride. When Mr. Wilson settled on the North fork everything about him was in its primitive state, and his cabin was in perfect keeping with his wild surroundings \u2014 ' ' Wooden-barred the door, and the roof was covered with rushes. Latticed the windows were, and the window-panes were of paper, Oiled to admit the light, while the wind and rain were ex- cluded. There, too, he dug a well, and around it planted an orchard ; Still may be seen to this day some trace of the well and the orchard.\" Savages were still lingering in a scattered condi tion, feeble, small in numbers, by no means desir able as neighbors. Birds of prey, venomous serpents, marauding animals, and ferocious beasts of the forest abounded. One morning in the autumn of 1805, Mr. Wil son was suddenly called to his cabin door by a great noise and commotion among his pigs, one of which had been seized for a breakfast by a pan ther. The noisy demonstrations of the pig had promptly drawn the attention of the hogs, and they attacked the panther successfully, and not only released the pig, but treed the panther. Just at this crisis the pioneer-hunter reached his cabin door, and instantly comprehended the situation; the dogs and hogs were holding the animal in check. Taking his rifle from its hooks, he stepped out and fired, the animal falling among his dogs at the foot of the tree. Maurice Newman was one of the principal set tlers in Newark in 1804. He was acting justice of the peace after Squire Wright, and the third tavern-keeper, as before mentioned. John Van Buskirk was also a settler in this year, in Newark. He rebuilt the Petticord and Belt grist- and saw-mill, which he run persistently until his death in 1840. David Heron, David Hatfield and Archibald Wilson, jr., came in 1805. Mr. Wilson was one of the first \u2014 if not the first merchant in Newark, but was soon followed by Bradley Buckingham and David Moore. Mr. Wilson's biography states that paper,"], [557, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 547 Mr. J. Cass Little was born in Newark August 22, 1812, and lived here until his death, which occurred August 21, 1876. Among the later prominent and respected citi zens of Newark were Hugh McMullen and C. A Darlington. The former was born in York coun ty, Pennsylvania, May 2, 181 1, and came with his father's family (the late George McMullen) to this county in 181 9. He died in Chicago, Illinois, at an advanced age. Carey A. Darlington was a resident of Newark ten or twelve years, engaged in the mercantile business, beginning in 1823. On account of his health, he gave up merchandising, and became a farmer and stock-raiser in Marion county. He died April 3, 1874. One of the first celebrations of American inde pendence, perhaps the very first that took place in Licking county, was that of 1807. It was held on the north side of the public square, the dinner be ing the joint production of Maurice Newman and Abraham Johnson, two of the tavern-keepers of Newark. A hog, sheep and deer, well roasted, graced the table. The hog had an ear of corn in its mouth, and was trimmed with lettuce ; the sheep had a bunch of fennel in its mouth, and was trimmed with parsley; and the deer, killed for the occasion by Hananiah Pugh, was decorated with leaves, vines and flowers from the forest. Captain Archibald Wilson, sr., was president of the day; Rev. John Emmett, a Methodist preacher, was chaplain of the occasion, and Dr. John J. Brice read the Declaration of Independence. The ora tion was prepared by Archibald Wilson, jr., but was read by Dr. John J. Brice, owing to the sick ness of the author. The military, under the com mand of Captain John Spencer, were present in force, and fired volleys in response to the toasts. The best of feeling characterized the occasion, which was finally brought to a close by a ball at night. There was a marked difference between those pioneer gatherings and the pablic meetings of to day. Like the grasp of a pioneer's hand, there was an honest earnestness in them. The following, taken from a copy of the Advo cate of July, 1824, is worthy of preservation as showing the manner of nominating a President: \"Pursuant to public notice, a great number of citizens of Licking county met at the court house in Newark (Ohio) to nominate a suitable candidate for President' of the United States. After the meeting was organized by the appointment of Dr. John J. Brice chairman, and B. Briggs secretary, the following preamble and resolutions were almost unanimously adopted: \"Whereas, It being well known by every intelligent citizen that roads and canals are indispensable to the prosperity of the United States, and particularly to the western country; and it being well known that the western part of the United States has not had a proportionate share of expenditure of the public moneys for these and other purposes: and \"Whereas, Henry Clay, a Representative in Congress from the State of Kentucky, has signalized himself by his zeal and industry to promote these great national objects, there fore \"Resolved, That we will use all honorable means to promote his election to the Presidency, for the reason above stated, and for his uniform adherence to republican principles, and support of the cause, of liberty throughout the world. \"Resolved, That William Wilson, Stephen C. Smith and James Holmes be a committee of correspondence, to corres pond with other committees 'throughout the State favorable to the election of Henry Clay, on the subject of the Presiden tial election. \"Resolved, That this meeting do now adjourn sine die.\" It will be observed from the above that the manner of nominating a President differed very materially from the present method ; and that the issues that then seemed of overwhelming impor tance have been lost to view, and appear almost frivolous, as the political issues of to-day may ap pear fifty years hence. It was a very simple way these pioneers had of doing things. Since that, railroads and the telegraph have revolutionized things somewhat. These were the days of stage coaches, when the world \"and the rest of man kind\" moved slowly; and were, perhaps, better for it. News then traveled slowly; post office facili ties were in a primitive condition. Probably the first mail brought to Newark was over the very rough, narrow road from Zanesville to Newark, Granville and Columbus, or perhaps Worthington. Maurice Newman was probably the first acting post master in Newark, though not regularly appointed by the Postmaster General and kept the office at his hotel, about the year 1805; and it is now somewhat astonishing to think that the stage-coach was the principal means of mail and passenger transporta tion to and from Newark for nearly fifty years. The canal came earlier, it is true, but it did not probably affect the business of the stage lines to a great extent. It is found that, in 1825, \"Mr."], [558, "548 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. Giles C. Harrington, of this place, will commence running his stage twice a week from Zanesville to Columbus, after the first of July next.\" It may be fair to conclude from this that but one stage per week had been on the road between these points before the time mentioned. Newark had then been in existence for twenty-three years. The following is a list of Newark postmasters from the year 1809 up to the present time, with the date of their appointment: David Moore, February 19, 1809; Amos H. Caffee, February 6, 1818; Peter Schmucker, June 8, 1829; Benjamin Briggs, April 30, 1833; Mahlon M. Caffee, June 10, 1841; Levi J. Haughey, January 19, 1843; Jonathan Taylor, August 2, 1847; Daniel Hum phreys, April 17, 1848; George P. Conradf April n, 1849; William Richards, March 6, 1851; Will iam P. Morrison, April 6, 1853; William Parr, March 20, 1854; Edmund J. Ellis, January 10, 1855; William Bell, jr., July 24, 1855; James E. Lewis, October 21, 1858; Charles B. Giffin, March 28, 1861; Thomas J. Anderson, August 1, 1866; James R. Stanbery, March 28, 1867; Apple ton B. Clarke, April 5, 1869; William C. Lyon, May 17, 1877, and who is the present incumbent. Mr. William Wing says: ' ' The mail first carried in a stage or hack from Newark to Columbus via Granville, was by Giles C. Harrington in 1822. He was succeeded by Willard Warner, I think, till 1828, when Neil, Moore & Co. , run their stages through from Jacksontown, on the pike, via Newark and Granville to Columbus, until the National road was completed to Columbus in 1832 or 1833 ; after that Warner carried the mail from Jacksontown to New ark and Granville, and run a two-horse stage.\" A daily mail was established from Newark to Mt. Vernon in the month of December, 1835. The National road coming into the county about the same time with the Ohio canal, gave a great impetus to emigration, and Newark took a great step forward. It began to assume the appearance of a lively business town. It became a grain market, which necessitated the building of ware houses. The first of these warehouses was erected by George Baker & Co., on the canal between Fourth and Fifth streets; others were erected be-. tween Second and Third streets, and Mr. Sher wood, in 1 83 1, erected one near the corner of Canal and Second streets, on the east side of Second. The canal gave an outlet to produce of all kinds, thus creating a market and advancing prices with astonishing rapidity. Wheat went from twenty-five cents to seventy-five cents and one dol lar per bushel; other products of the soil and the woods, as corn, oats, whiskey, pork, furs, peltry, etc., were correspondingly advanced. In opening up the new country these agencies took the place of the railroads of to-day, and were equally as effective though working with less rapidity. The editor of the Advocate, Mr. B. Briggs, thus writes at that time: \"Already we see the effects of the canal on our town. The price of property has risen fifty per cent. Five brick kilns will be burnt in the environs of Newark, during the present (Au gust, 1825.) and three succeeding months, and some of the brick will go through the hands of the brick-layers during that time. The change that has taken place in the appearance of the place since it was expected the canal would pass by it, is very striking. Before that time there were but three or four brick buildings in it, exclusive of the public ones; the balance were all dilapidated logs and frames. Now there are several good brick houses erected, and the foundations of two or three more are laid. \"It is true, the grass continues to grow in our streets, and the sheep to feed in the public square, but when it is known that the former are very wide, and the latter large enough for a farm, these things will not be considered as 111. favorable omens. \"While on this subject, our thoughts naturally turn to the bad state of the meeting-house, about which we have often had unpleasant reflections. It might be wrong, however, in us to say anything about it in the paper, since we never appropriated anything toward building it. Still we will venture merely to call the attention of our seniors to it, and recommend the adop tion of measures for its repair or demolition. The Turks, we verily believe, have no mosque that makes so wretched an ap pearance as does the brick meeting-house in Newark.\" Mr. Briggs refers here to the brick church erected by the Presbyterians in the park, west side, which was poorly constructed, and was taken down after a few years service, the people fearing it would fall upon them. It was the first church building erected in Newark. October 1st, of the same year (1825), a meeting of those interested was held in this house, at which Messrs. Stephen C. Smith, S. S. Miles and Moses Moore, were ap pointed a committee to draft a plan for a new \"meeting-house\" and take other preliminary steps toward erecting it. Here is what Hon. Isaac Smucker, in his \"Rec ollections,\" says of Newark and vicinity, in an early day: \"In 1825, the writer arrived in Newark after a journey across"], [559, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 549 the Alleghanies, of four hundred miles, performed on foot, which, at that time, was the usual mode of travel with men of very limited funds. Those of more means traveled on horse back, while those more liberally supplied with cash took the family carriage or the public stage. \" The then very small village of Newark was reached about nine o'clock at night. It was a very pleasant starlight or moon light night, just light enough to indicate to a weary traveler, who had safely crossed the rickety old bridge across the North furk, and reached the western termination of East Main street, and there taken his position just between the 'Cully' and 'Green House' taverns, deliberately viewing the situation from this point of observation, that the 'public square\" was too ex tensively dotted with ponds of large and small proportions, to render it altogether a safe operation to venture forward with out a guide. Accordingly a dime was invested on a small lad, on condition that he should 'safely guide the foot-sore, water bound traveler along the winding track among the ponds, across the square to the residence of the father of the belated foot man, who, at that time, domiciled iit the southwest corner of West Main and Fourth streets. \"The most important event to Newark and Licking county in that year was the celebration of the Fourth of July at 'Licking Summit,' four miles south of Newark, on the Ohio canal. An immense throng gathered to see Governor DeWitt Clinton, of New York, throw out the first shovel of dirt in the construction of the canal. Governor Worthington and nu merous celebrities of this and other States were present. The occasion was characterized by an immense display of military toggery, such as brass buttons, cockades, plumes, sashes, epau lettes and many other fancy trappings that profusely orna mented the outer garments of the military chieftains present. \"There was also a great display of independent military companies, called volunteers, who also appeared in their best uniforms. General Edward King, of Chillicothe, and General Sanderson, of Lancaster, were among the most conspicuous military commanders on that celebrated occasion. Our late friends and fellow-citizens, Captains Merideth Darlington and Major Warren, the former of Newark, and the latter of Gran ville, commanded the local or home troops on the occasion. This was the heroic age of Ohio\u2014 the age of military glory. Hon. Thomas Ewing, then in the full enjoyment of his great intellectual powers, was the orator of the day, and, in the judg ment of the great crowd who heard him, he acquitted himself splendidly. \"Governor Clinton threw out the first shovelfull of earth in the construction of the eanal. He had been the projector of the Erie canal, and had employed his great talents and influence to put the Empire State on the highway to prosperity and wealth by procuring the adoption of a liberal ' internal improve ment policy. This same policy he urged upon Ohio, and in consequence thereof he became very popular among its friends here; hence the position of honor assigned him. Hon. William Stanbery ablv advocated our canal policy in the senate of Ohio. Gov. Worthington, the most influential statesman in Ohio, held the same views. \"The next most important event in 1825 was the abortive at tempt to hang a fellow by the name ot Peter Dimond, a miner at Mary Ann furnace, who had been convicted of the murder of Mitchell, a fellow ore-digger. This man, while intoxicated and in a fit of passion, struck Mitchell (with whom he was quarreling) a blow with a gun-barrel across the head, from the 25 effects of which he died. The absence of delibration and pre meditation made it a crime of a lower grade than murder in the first degree, and he should have been convicted of the second grade of homicide. Hon. Thomas Ewing and William Stanbery defended him with great zeal and ability, but he was nevertheless found guilty and sentenced to be hung. The gal lows was erected, the giave dug, the coffin made, so was the shroud, and the culprit put inside of it; the crowd collected from far and near; the military were marshaled in large num bers to prevent the escape or rescue of Peter, and to give eclat to the interesting occasion. The sermon was preached, the doctors were on hand to determine when Dimond's pulse ceased its beatings by reason of the strangling process, and, in short, al things were ready to swing the culprit into eternity, when a dashing horseman came up crying at the top of his voice that he had a message from the Governor of the State of Ohio. This proved to be Isaac Cool, who knew well how to act such a part with a flourish. The commander of the troops cleared the way tor him, when he, with due regard to style, passed the document with the Great Seal of the State of Ohio attached, to the sheriff, which proved to be a respite or suspension of the sentence. This respite resulted at last in a commutation to ten years' service, for the hero of the day, in the penitentiary. \"This respite arrangement of our good old governor was promptly acceded to by Peter, much to the disgust of a well sold and greatly befooled crqwd, who had at some expense and at the neglect of their business and crops at a very busy season of the year, gathered here in force to witness the death agonies of a fellow being on the gallows, and they could not brook the idea of a disappointment. \"This is, however, true of only the more brutal of the spec tators; the better portion were thrilled with joy at the manner of its termination. This performance came off between Locust and Church, and Third and Fifth streets. The gallows stood about midway between Locust and Church streets, on Fourth street, or a little east of it. \"Dimond's counsel, after the death penalty had been pro nounced, prepared and laid before Governor Morrow, the facts in the case, who saw at once that he had been illegally and un justly convicted and sentenced; he therefore decided to give him the proper punishment for his offence. As he had com mitted a great crime, he thought best to give him ten yeats in prison, and in addition put him through the pangs of antici pated hanging. He kept the terrors of an ignominious death hanging over him to the last moment. \" The horse racing of r82S was also an event of no small magnitude, in the estimation of manv. The race-course was bounded on the north by the southern portion of the town, on the south by South fork, on the east by Fourth street, and on the west by Raccoon creek. An immense crowd of people, of all colors, sexes and conditions, had collected. They came from adjacent counties and also from remote parts of the State, as well as our own county. One main race for sweepstakes was run by three horses, named Ground Hog, Red Fox, and Prai rie Mule. The fir^t named was a large grey horse owned in Muskingum, I believe, and was the winner. The Red Fox was a small sorrel, and came in second best. The race was a mile, or perhaps more, to be repeated. Many other races were run. The accompaniments were a large consumption of whiskey and similar fluids; an overloading of many stomachs with Bentlev's ginger cakes; a considerable number of fisticuffs, much excite ment, quarreling and profanity; extensive thimble-rigging and"], [560, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 55\u00b0 sweat-cloth gambling; pocket-picking and stealing, and various other groveling aud villainous practices that were intensely dis gusting to decent people. \"I close my recollections of 1825 with a brief reference to the elections of that year. When I arrived in Newark, a vigorous contest was going on for a seat in the legislature between Bradley Buckingham and Stephen C. Smith. The Newark Advocate, edited by the late Benjamin Briggs, the only paper printed in the county, was full of spirited communications on the subject, pro and con. Henry Shurtz was fighting Mr. Buckingham vigorously, charging him in the Advocate with get ting some advantage of him in a whiskey trade. Whiskey was at that time an article of extensive trade and commerce; indeed, it came near being a legal tender in payment of debts. Mr. Buckingham was a prosperous and wealthy merchant of New ark, and known to almost everybody in the county. He came to Newark at an early day, and had kept himself in communi cation constantly by his extensive business operations, and to a limited extent was a public officer. His reputation was good, character excellent, and he was withal a gentleman of rather pleasant, popular manners. \"Mr. Smith was a more recent settler. He came originallv from New Jersey to Marietta in 1806, and from there in 1809 to Muskingum county, where he was several times honored with elections to the legislature, and to the associate judgeship of the common pleas court. He had, moreover, been actively patriotic in the War of 1812, having rendered efficient services as adjutant of the regiment commanded by Lewis Cass. He came to Licking county in 1818, and was a member of the leg islature in 1824. He was a man of liberal mental endowments, extensive reading and information. He had one of the best libraries in our county, and we had few men of more extensive intelligence on a great variety of subjects. He was without re proach, and lived and died an honest man. \"Mr. Buckingham was the successful candidate, but by a very small majority \u2014 ten votes, I think. The next year they were again competitors, and Mr. Smith was successful by a meagre majority. Messrs. Buckingham and Smith retired upon their legislative laurels, the former in 1826, and the latter in 1827, neither of them again holding any public office.\" Newark became an incorporated town by act of the general assembly, in February, 1826, and on the sixteenth of the following month an election was held which resulted in the choice of Lucius Smith for mayor; C. W. Searle, recorder, and Robert Davidson, William W. Gault, Bradley Buckingham, John J. Brice, and John Cunning ham, for trustees, or councilmen. Thus Newark came into existence as a town, and thereafter en joyed the privileges of a government of its own. The mayors of this town are as follows, with the dates of their service: Lucius Smith, 1826; Robert Davidson, 1827; Peter Schmucker, 1828; Corrington W. Searle, 1829; Carey A. Darlington, 1830; Benjamin Briggs, 1 831; Benjamin Briggs, 1832; Samuel M. Browning, 1833; Joshua Mathiot, 1834; M. M. Caffee, 1835; S. M. Browning, 1836; Israel Dille, 1837; Israel Dille, 1838; George M. Young, 1839; George M. Young, 1840; George M. Young, 1841; George M. Young, 1842; M. M. Caffee, 1843; B. W. Brice, jr., 1844; B. W. Brice, jr., 1845; B. W. Brice, jr., 1846; A. H. Caffee, 1847; A. H. Caffee, 1848; A. H. Caffee, 1849; Edward Stan- bery, 1850; Daniel Humphrey, 1851; Daniel Humphrey, 1852; Daniel Humphrey, 1853; Dan- iel Humphrey, 1854; Daniel Hamphrey, 1855; William B Woods, 1856; William B. Woods, 1857; Charles H. Kibler, 1858; Charles H. Kib- ler, 1859. Mr. Kibler was the last mayor of the town of Newark. Having now a population of over five thousand it was incorporated as a city of the second class, March 2, 1860. First mayor, Gibson Atherton, 1860. Mr. Atherton continued to hold this office two terms, or including 1863; John W. Brice followed one term including 1865; Joel M. Dennis, one term, including 1867; John W. Brice, again one term, including r869; George M. Grasser, one term, including 187 1; James White, one term, including 1873; D. C. Wine- garner, two terms, including 1877, and the present mayor, Isaac W. Bigelow, has served since the latter date. The Ohio Gazetteer, published in 1831, makes this mention of Newark: \"Distance from Cleve- land by canal one hundred and seventy-six miles. North latitude 40\u00b0 4', west longtitude 5\u00b0 26'. It was laid out in the year 1802, by the late General William C. Schenck, on the plan of Newark, in New Jersey, with streets from six to eight rods wide, all crossing each other at right angles. It is situated in a township of the same name, and contains two hundred and fifty dwelling houses, ten stores, five taverns, two printing offices, two Jarge ware-houses, a market house, a Methodist meeting house, and the usual county buildings.\" The population of Newark in 1830, was 999; in 1835 1392. The cholera visited the town in the summer of 1834; many of its inhabitants died, and the growth of the place was, probably, checked for a time._ It grew slowly but steadily until about 1850 when it took an other long stride forward. Three railroads entered the place between 1848 and 1855, and brought to Newark the light and"], [561, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 551 life of commerce; and since that time its growth and developement have kept pace with the surround ing country. The amount of business in the city may be sum med up nearly as follows, though changes are con tinually occurring and the business can only be approximated. There are three agricultural imple ment stores; twenty-six attorneys at law; two auction and commission merchants; eight bakers and confectioners; two banks; ten barbers; nine blacksmiths; one boiler maker; two book and sta tionery stores; twenty-three boot and shoe stores and manufacturing and repairing establishments; two brick yards; one broom maker; three carriage makers; six china, glass and queensware stores; five clothing stores; ten or more coal dealers; three commission merchants; two express compa nies; five dentists; eight drug stores; eight dry goods stores; two flouring mills, doing a large business; four foundries and machine shops; two furniture dealers; about fifty or sixty retail gro cery establishments; two wholesale grocers; two gunsmiths; three hardware stores; five hat and cap stores; five hotels; a large number of insur ance and other agents; eight livery stables; four lumber dealers; two marble works; seven meat markets; eight merchant tailors; five newspapers; one notion store; four photographers; twenty7five physicians; three planing mills; four printing es tablishments, of which that of Clark & Under wood, of the American, stands at the head; four saddlery and harness shops; one saw-mill; three sewing machine agencies; one soap and candle fac tory; five stove and tin stores; two tanners and cur riers; three wagon makers; and two fine jewelry es tablishments. Probably no jewelry houses in cen tral Ohio have a finer stock, or a better estab lished reputation than those of Henry C. Bostwick and H. S. Sprague. Besides the above regular business establishments Newark has the usual num ber of cigar makers and establishments, saloons, restaurants, small manufactories of different kinds, and many smaller business concerns. Yet the busi ness of Newark is not what it should be, consid ering its location on the edge of the great coal fields, and is not, probably, what it will be in the future. It. has advantages almost unsurpassed for busi ness and manufacturing, and it would seem as if the latter department of business, especially, must continually increase as the years go by. Indeed, since the country has revived from the panic of 1873, manufacturing has increased iu Newark. Among these establishments may be mentioned the stove works of Ashley & Kibler, established two years ago, in the old Mosier foundry. Thomas' foundry and machine shops were estab lished about 1866. It is conducted by Mr. J. F. Thomas. Simpson's plow works were established in 1851; the Newark marble works, in 1841, by O. F. Mehurin; Ball & Ward's carriage and wagon works in 1836, and are still in successful operation, occupying two large buildings \u2014 a stone and frame \u2014 on the corner of Church and First streets. Messrs. Gardner & Vance's planing-mill was established in 1873; was burnt down in 1S77, but rebuilt, of brick, and is now in successful operation. Stasel & Lamb's planing-mill was es tablished in 1877, and that of A. Smucker & Sons in 1866. Space, however, forbids a satisfactory review of all the manufacturing and business in terests of the city. Two large flouring-mills are in successful operation; those of E. M. Mont gomery and D. Thomas & Sons. The former stands at the foot of Church street, on the site of one of the first mills in the county, elsewhere mentioned. Both are using steam power, and do ing a large and successful business. Of banks, there are two at present \u2014 the Frank lin and First National. The first of these was established about 1845, ar>d was the first perma nent bank started in Newark. There were, per haps, two or three established before, one by the Smiths, in or about 1838. This latter bank was in existence ten or a dozen years, the man agers bringing their currency from Michigan for distribution here. The Franklin bank was a private institution, established by Edward Frank lin, in the old brick building at the southwest corner of the square, where the Adams express company is now located. In 1849, Franklin admitted his son, John H., as partner, and the firm became Edward Franklin & Son. In 1859, the senior Franklin died, but the son continued the business under the same firm name until 1862, when he .admitted his brother, Benjamin, and the firm became Edward Franklin's Sons.

The attendance, as it is, is undiminished. The association feels that it is entitled to the support of the good peo ple of the city in its works, and is gratified to know that its work is being appreciated. The Ladies' Library association was organized in March, 1871. A few ladies met at the residence of Mr. George M. Davidson, where the society was organized, and where they continued to meet for six months or more, when they occupied a room belonging to Mr. T. J. Davis, over the First Na tional bank. In this room their meetings were held about six years, when they removed to Jerome Buckingham's law office. In the spring of 1880, their society and its possessions having grown somewhat beyond the limits of a law office, they secured a room in the court house, where the society now meets, and where it has collected about one thousand volumes. Mrs. Jerome Buckingham, Mrs. Virgil Wright, Mrs. T. J. Davis, Mrs. George Davidson, Miss Minnie Sprague and others were influential in es tablishing this society. Mrs. Davidson was its first president, and Miss Sprague, secretary and treas urer. The membership fee is two dollars per annum, but books are let to those not members by the payment of ten cents a volume. This society is gradually obtaining a firmer foot-hold, and is considered a permanent institution. The Licking County Medical society was or ganized in 1874. About forty years ago a society had been in existence called the \"Licking County Medical and Philosophical society,\" which had been abandoned after a few years operation. The first meetings of the present society, before organization, were held in the office of Dr. Charles P. King, that gentleman being very active in the matter. The first meeting for organization, at which about twenty physicians appeared, was held in the drug store of Collins & Thurston. Dr. Barrows was elected president. The society has steadily grown since that time until it includes most of the physicians of the county and some outside of it. The meetings are now held in the court house, in the same room occupied by the Rider was admitted to the firm in 1873, and in 1876, this firm sold out to the present firm, Messrs. Robbins, Wing & Winegarner who con duct the business under the old firm name. The Franklins erected the present brick block, at the southwest corner of the square, and moved the business into it about 1850. The First National bank began operations in 1865, with a capital of one hundred thousand dol lars. Mr. J. Buckingham was president and Vir gil H. Wright cashier. Its first location was where Messrs. Dougherty & Dod'd's tin shop is now lo cated. In 1869-70, the proprietors erected the present brick block, on the corner of Third street and public square, fitting up a room for their pur pose in the corner of the building and moving into it in 1870. As a place of residence Newark cannot be greatly excelled. The citizens are largely intelli gent, sociable, and the larger part of them enjoy ing most of the good things of the world; there are no division lines worthy of mention \u2014 no class or aristocracy \u2014 the only requisite of good citizen ship and good standing being obedience to the laws and the dictates of humanity. The population of the city in *88o was nine thousand six hundred and two, and the number of streets one hundred and one. It may not be well to close this chapter without placing upon permanent record a few facts regard ing the various societies of the city, of which there are the usual number. The Young Men's Christian association is just entering upon the fifth year of its existence with as bright prospects as it has ever enjoyed. The work performed the past year is fully equal to that of previous years. The workers have been fewer in number, but they have been all the more faith ful. More workers are needed. The reading-room is as inviting a place as can be found anywhere. The supply of papers is good; a few more are needed, however, and more magazines and books. The financial condition of the association is much better than it was a year ago.

This organiza tion continued working under dispensation until October 4, 1828, when the charter was received, and the following were the first officers under this charter: Corrington W. Searls, W.

In the summer of 1803 Rev. John Wright vis ited this place. He was born in Westmoreland county, Pennsylvania, in 1777. Accustomed to frontier life from his earliest recollections, being familiar with the rifle carried to the house of God by the worshipers, for use in case of attack by In dians, he was well fitted for ministerial labors among the pioneers. In the year 1806 Rev. James Scott preached regularly for some months. As these two men were among the earliest, most active and widely known of the pioneer Presbyterian ministers of central Ohio, they deserve more than a passing notice. Rev. John Wright graduated at Dickinson col lege, Pennsylvania, and was licensed to preach about 1 800 by the presbytery of Redstone. He engaged in missionary labors two or three years in Virginia, North and South Carolina, returning through regions now comprising Tennessee, Ken tucky and Ohio. In this work he became acquainted with a little band of Presbyterians upon the Hock-Hocking and Rush creek, and settled among them in 1804. In 1806 he became pastor of Hock-Hocking (Lancas ter) and Rush creek churches. Here he preached thirty-two years, his labors being scattered over a wide extent of country. Many of the churches through this part of Ohio were organized through his instrumentality. He died at Delphi, Indiana, at the residence of his son, Rev. E. W. Wright August 31, 1854, in his seventy-eighth year. Rev. James Scott was born in Pennsylvania, east of the mountains, in 1775. He graduated at Can nonsburgh, Pennsylvania, and located at Mt. Ver non in 1807. Ahout 1810 he was married to the \"Where dusky savage wooed his dusky mate, And through the forest rang his battle cry, Now stands the arched and templed halls of State, And gilded steeples pointing to the sky.\" THERE are, at present, seventeen church organ izations within the limits of Newark township, fourteen of which are in the city. This fact alone speaks volumes for civilization, law, order and in telligence. Life, liberty and property cannot but be safe in such a community. The history of these churches covers the full period of time since the first settlement began in the wilderness. Ministers of the Gospel were among the first to brave the per ils and hardships of the frontier, where they planted the seed that has grown, developed and borne fruit, the evidence of which appears in these beautiful churches, and in the religion and higher civilization of the people. The first Presbyterian. \u2014 The doctrines taught by this denomination were the first introduced into this section. The first Christian minister who preached on the territory now occupied by the city of Newark, was the Rev. Mr. McDonald, a Pres byterian. He came to this place in 1802, on his way to Franklinton, now Columbus, and was probably a missionary from the neighborhood of Pittsburgh. He was a middle aged man at the time of his visit, and lodged at the house of Sam uel Elliott, who lived about one and one-half miles east of Newark. He preached several times to the families that were here, which, at that early date, were few in number, either at their houses or in the open air. Thus Presbyterianism was introduced by a living preacher upon the very threshold of the existence of the city. 554 *"], [565, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 555 daughter of Archibald Wilson, of Newark. He preached at Mt. Vernon, Fredericktown, and Mar tinsburgh, the extremes of his pastoral charge being about twenty miles apart. Indians were yet in the country, and he was compelled to endure much hardship and danger in his circuit. He frequently walked to Martinsburgh, eleven miles, to preach, and that, too, after searching vainly in the woods for his horse. He died in September, 185 1, in his seventy-eighth year. Through the efforts of these ministers, and by the removal to Newark of some families of Pres byterian education, that element in the community had, in 1808, attained sufficient strength to warrant the formation of a church, which was accordingly acomplished in the autumn of this year. Rev. John Wright was present and officiated at this or ganization. David Moore and James Taylor were elected elders, and in the following year Jacob Wil son was elected an elder. Of these elders, David Moore was born in Gettys burgh, Pennsylvania, April 9, 1774, He came to Newark in the spring of 1808, and died April 27 1845, aged seventy-one years. He was a good business man, and was an elder of this church about thirty years. James Taylor was born in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, in He removed to Washington county, Pennsylvania, and subsequent ly to the vicinity of Wheeling, Virginia. He came to Newark in 1804. He was one of the first judges in the county, having been elected in 1808. He died at the residence of his son in-law, James Maholm, in 1844 at the advanced age of ninty-one. He was a revolutionary soldier; and was with Colonel Wil liamson in his campaign against the Moravian Ind ians, and with seventeen others cast his vote against that massacre. He was a man of high character and universally respected; and was an elder of this church for thirty-six years. The other elder, Jacob, Wilson, was born in Hardy county, Virginia, Sep tember 15, 1781, and came to Licking county in 1803. He raised a crop of corn in the North Fork valley, a mile above Newark, and -returned in the fall to Virginia. In March, 1804, he married Nancy Colville, of Shenandoah county, and soon after removed to this place where he lived until his death, on the eleventh of October, 1827, when he was but forty-eight. He served in the capacity of elder eighteen years, and led the singing in the church. The church was not supplied with regular preach ing for more than a year after its organization. In the autumn of 1809, the pastoral services of Rev. George Van Eman were secured. He was then a young man twenty-three years of age, unmarried, and had just completed his educational course. As late as 1868, Mr. Van Eman was yet living, as will be seen from the following letter, dated, Findlay, Hancock county, Ohio, September 1, 1868. \"I settled in Newark in the fall of 1809, was ordained and installed there between Christmas of that year and New Years day, 1810. Revs. John Wright, of Lancaster; Jacob Lindley, of Athens, and James Scott, of Mt. Vernon, were at the ordina tion. I preached in the court house, sometimes also used as a school-house, a hewed-log building which stood in the public square. I continued pastor three years and six months, when my health failed and I did not preach for some years. \" T cannot tell the number of members, nor who they were. There were two Mr. Moores, with their wives, and several by the name of Wilson. I was the first of our order who settled there. No meeting-house was built in my time. After I com menced preaching again I spent a Sabbath in Newark on my way to the synod at Chillicothe, and preached the first sermon in their new house of worship, just finished. It was a building, perhaps, forty by fifty feet, and stood on the public square. \"There were a goodly number of exemplary Christians, as I hope, there in my time. There were some careless, profane, and ungodly men, but no violent opposition to religion. I had the good will of all so far as 1 know, and all classes attended the meetings. \"I was born in Washington county, Pennsylvania, in 1786, on the twenty-third of April; received my education at Cannons burgh; united with the church while at college; graduated in the fall of 1806; studied theology under Dr. McMillen; was li censed by the presbytery of Ohio in 1808, in Upper Buffalo meeting-house, and just one year after that was ordained. I took part in the organization of Richland presbytery; was pas tor'of the church at Mansfield two years and a half, then went to Greene county, Pennsylvania, and spent fifteen years as pas tor of the same churches in New Providence and Jefferson. 1 then gave up my charge and came to this place, and have been in this county thirty-two years. I was the first pastor at New ark, Mansfield, and this place. I have had no charge since re signing this church on account of age, but preach occasionally. This venerable preacher died in Findlay March 12, 1877, in the ninety-first year of his age. In Mansfield he is spoken of as one of the first min isters in that place. He spent most of his minis terial life as a pioneer preacher, acceptably and successfully. He was cheerful, pleasant, compan ionable in his intercourse, and exemplary in all the relations of life. He was an honorary member of"], [566, "556 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. raised eighteen inches higher at one end of the house than at the other; and to have the whole of said work completed by the first day of November next; and it is agreed between the parties that af ter its completion it shall remain in possession of said parties of the first part as security, until the full amount of two thousand seven hundred dollars shall be paid to them, which sum they are to receive for the completion of the aforemen tioned building in the manner aforesaid.\" Until the completion of this house the congre gation had held all their religious services in a building used for purposes of court, school, 'and church, which stood on the north side of the pub lic square. It was a structure of hewed logs, con taining one room which had seats of rough boards laid upon logs. This new church stood on the west side of what is now the park ; the west end of the house being near the west side of the park. Mr. Van Eman, in a letter written subsequently to the one above given, referring to the opening of this church edifice in the fall of 1816, says: \"Mr. Davis, who built the house, had finished it a day or two before I was there, and to secure prompt payment, had locked it up. The people did not know what to do. On Sab bath morning Mr. William Stanbery, a lawyer, took a boy with him to the house, raised the window and lifted in the boy, who opened the doors. The congregation, at the appointed hour, entered, Mr. Davis and his family among the rest. There was no disturbance about it. Mr. Davis told me, at the close of the meeting that he had promised not to open the house, but was glad it was done. My text that day was, ' I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.\" The congregation having for the first time a house of worship of its own, elected William Trin dle and Joseph Moore elders, secured regular pulpit ministrations and entered upon a new career of prosperity. Mr. Baird was a Calvinist of the old school, and maintained his views persistently. During a por tion of the time he resided here he engaged in teaching in connection with his ministerial work. His first class was formed for the purpose of study ing the Latin language. This class was composed of B. W. Brice, J. R. Stanbery, Nathaniel English, J. N. Wilson, John C. Gault, and John Moore. This class subsequently grew into one of greater numbers and a wider scope of study. The pupils cherished for him the strongest at tachment. On one occasion one of his pupils, J. the Pioneer society of Newark, and attended one of its meetings in October, 1868, coming all the way from his home in Hancock county expressly for that purpose. Many will remember his inter esting addresses at that time, consisting, for the most part, of reminiscences of early times in the county. His stay extended over the Sabbath, when he gave to the people of the congregation of his former charge an exceedingly interesting dis course, a few of his old parishioners being present who had been attendants upon his ministry more than fifty years before. Of that number, Mrs. James M. Taylor and Mrs. Isaac Wilson are be lieved to be the sole survivors, He was then eighty-two years of age, but vigorous physically and mentally. From the summer of 181 2 to the summer of 181 5 this church was without a pastor; but during the summer of 1815 Rev. Thomas D. Baird was called. Mr. Baird was born in the county of Down, Ireland, December 26, 1773; came to the United States in :8o2, and settled in South Caro lina in 1805. He was licensed in 181 1, ordained in 1813, and came to Newark about August, 181 5. In the following year the first building for the Presbyterian society was erected in Newark. On the eighth of March, 1816, an article of agreement was entered into \" between Zachariah Davis and Robert Davidson of the first part, and William Wilson, Abraham C. Wilson and Bradley Buckingham of the second part, in which the said parties agreed to the building of a meeting-house for the Presbyterian congregation of the town of Newark, to be of the following dimensions and materials, viz: A brick building fifty-four by forty six feet, the foundation of stone, the walls \"of which are to be two and a half feet high and two feet thick; the brick walls of said building to be eighteen inches thick, and fifteen feet high, with suitable brick cornice; to put four windows in each side; to put in two doors, which are to be seven feet high and four feet wide (to be double), with a window above each door, with eight lights each; the pillars which support the roof to be cased up to the plastering overhead, the house to be cased all around as high as the windows; to put in forty pews, which are to be three feet high, with a suita ble door to each pew, well hung; the floor to be"], [567, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 557 N. Wilson, having been maliciously, and without cause, threatened with a whipping by a boy belong- ing to another school, and having discovered that he was about to be assailed, turned upon his antagonist and gave him a severe handling. The teacher on the following morning, when the circum- stances of the case were explained, instead of ad- ministering the punishment that was apprehended, gave to the school in the clearest and most forcible manner his views upon the subject of self-defence, and the laws that should govern the social relations and intercourse of boys and men, at school and through life. He enjoined upon his pupils that they should always be careful not to be in the wrong, and when they were in the right they should not submit tamely to wrong and injustice, but in a manly way, maintain their rights. In 1820 Mr. Baird resigned his charge and re- moved to Pennsyhrania, where he continued pas- toral labor about ten years. While returning from a visit to the south he was attacked by disease, and died in North Carolina, January 7, 1839. He was a man of great vigor of intellect and energy of will. He was an' old school man and very decided in his convictions.\" In 1820 Rev. Solomon S. Miles preached a few times in Newark, and in April, 182 1, came here to leside. He was a graduate of the Ohio university at Athens, in the same class with Hon. Thomas Ewing, and Rev. Henry Perkins, D. D., or New Jersey. Early in his ministry, a Sabbath-school was or- ganized \u2014 the first in this city. This was formed in June, 1822. A weekly prayer meeting was also established in the same year. About 1824-5, by the efforts of Mr. Miles, a more active missionary spirit was awakened. Considerable interest was also excited about the same time in the work of Bible and tract distribution in the town and over the county. In the year 1825 the church building became unfit for occupancy. On the Fourth of July of that year occurred the ceremonies in connection with the opening of the Ohio canal. Many strangers were present, among whom were Hon. Thomas Ewing, Governor Morrow, Ex-Governor Worthington, Governor De Witt Clinton, of New York, and others. On the day preceding the cele- bration (Sunday), a large audience, of which the distinguished strangers named formed a part, were assembled in the Presbyterian church. A severe storm arose during the service, and the roof being inadequate to the protection of the house against rain, the plastering began to fall from the ceiling in quantities somewhat alarming, and the congrega tion becoming, in a measure, panic-stricken, abandoned the church, and fled through the storm to the old .court house, injuring several persons in the rush and confusion. After this, the house was not long used. In the following year it was sold to Mr. Z. Davis, the gentleman who erected it, and removed. The congregation now worshipped for a time in the old court house again, and in a school-house near the locks of the canal not far from the pres ent location of the Episcopal church, and subse quently in the upper portion of the market house, a building that stood at the east end of West Main street. Religious services were held here until the present church edifice was erected. January 24, 1827, an act was passed by the legislature entitled \"an act to incorporate the First Presbyterian society of the town of Newark, in the county of Licking.\" The corporators were James Taylor, Jacob Wil son, John J. Brice, James M. Taylor, Bradley Buckingham, Hugh Scott, John Blaney, E. S. Woods, A. H. Caffee, Henry Smith and N. Cherry. Owing to ill health Mr. Miles was released from his pastoral charge\" here, May 18, 1831. The church was then united and harmonious, and numbered sixty members. Rev. James Harrison, a young man, supplied the pulpit for a short time before Mr. Miles' re signation. June 30, 1832, Rev. William Wylie, of Wheel ing, Virginia, visited the church, by invitation, with a view to permanent settlement. The next day, Sunday, July 1st, the new church edifice was opened for the first time for the reception of a congregation. This building was erected by Brad ley Buckingham and Buckingham Sherwood, and the pews were assessed and sold at such rates as to cover the cost of its construction and the value \u25a0 of the ground on which it stood. It, with the lot on which it is located, was conveyed by deed to"], [568, "558 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. the church in r834, by Bradley Buckingham and Buckingham and Albert Sherwood, for four thou- sand dollars. When the house was built, the pulpit was much higher than it now is, in accordance with the pre- vailing style of church architecture at that time; and it occupied a place at the opposite end of the house between the doors, the gallery extending across the west end. The bell was purchased in 1834 or 1835, and cost three hundred dollars. Mr. Wylie was called June 17, 1833, and installed the sixth of August following. The elders at this time were James Reeder, Jonas Ward, Robert Milligan and Luman Woodruff. In 1835 the membership was one hundred and sixty-two. A series of difficulties extending through sev- eral years, culminated in December, 1836, in the withdrawal from this church of more than twenty members, who, with others, organized the Second Presbyterian church of this city. Dr. Wylie continued his ministry here until 1854, through a period of more than twenty-two years. His was the longest pastorate the church had. He was, when he resigned, in his seventy- eighth year. He was a graduate of Jefferson college, and died in May, 1858, aged eighty-two years. He was succeeded by Rev. William M. Robinson, who had been his nearest neighbor in the ministry for ten and a half years. Mr. Rob- inson, a native of Pennsylvania, was installed June 8, 1855, and his pastoral relation with the church ceased June 1, 1862. During his pastor- ate, an old debt was cancelled, important repairs put upon the church edifice, and one hundred and sixteen persons received into the church. He was followed by Rev. A. S. Milholland in 1862, and Rev. H. T. Alexander in 1863. Rev. Henry M. Hervey began preaching to the congre- gation in May, 1863, and was installed December 15, 1863. Mr. Hervey was followed by Rev. Will- iam F. Brown, who was succeeded by the present pastor, Rev. R. R. Moore. The following is a list of the elders of this \u2022church from its organization to the present time: David Moore, 1808; James Taylor, 1808; Jacob Wilson, 1809; William Trindle, 1815; Joseph Moore, 1815; Noah Owen, 1818; Lewis Godden, i8i8; James Reeder, 1829; Jonas Ward, 1830; \u2022Chester Wells, 1829; Robert Milligan, 1830; Moses Moore, 1829; Luman Woodruff, 1833; George Wilson, 1836, John Wolf, 1836; James Belford, 1836; Nathan Barnes, 1836; E. J. Lewis, 1850; S. J. Reynolds, 1850; M. W. Swan, 1857; W. H. Winegardner, 1857; T. J. Davis, 1867; George F. Moore, 1867, and W. D. Hamilton, 1867. Among the later elders are J. C. Galbraith, Mr. Bates, Dr. Wotring, and in 1880 Mr. John Fulton, of Lockport, and Mr. William A. Jones were elected. Of all those who have held this office, Robert Milligan, yet living on Second street, has exercised its functions the longest term of years, having acted in the capacity of elder from 1830 to the present time. A choir was formed in 1833 or J834, of which Samuel H. Bancroft was the leader. The first Sabbath-school organized in Newark, was in connection with this church, in June, 1822. It was called \"The Newark association for afford ing Sabbath-school instruction.\" It had twelve \"articles of association,\" which provided for the election of a superintendent and four managers, by the members annually, on the first Monday in October; for the opening of the school at eight o'clock, a. m. ; for its opening and closing with prayer; for instruction in the Scriptures, and in the Westminster shorter catechism, not making, how ever, the study of the catechism obligatory upon all the pupils. They enjoined punctuality and dilligence upon all the teachers, and prohibited corporeal punishment in the school. \"Entreaty, persuasion, reproof, suitable rewards, and every means calculated to win the affections and secure the good behavior and attention of the scholars to their duties, will be resorted to; when these fail to secure the end proposed, recourse will be had to expulsion.\" These articles were signed by S. S. Miles, L. Godden, H. R. Gilmore, Charles Sager, J. Mathiot, George Shaver, C. W. Adams, John Cunningham, Jonathan Taylor, Thomas Taylor, Eliza Young, Ann Brice, Lucy C. Gilmore, Olive Taylor, and Sarah C. Burnham. Lewis Godden was elected superin tendent the first year, and Miss Sarah Burnham, Mrs. Ann Brice, Rev. S. S. Miles, and Joshua Mathiot, were made managers."], [569, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 559 The school was held in the church edifice until that building became unfit for occupancy in 1825, when it was held in the old court house. While it was held here, Rev. Mr. Judson, an agent of the American Sunday-school Union, visited this place, and, assisted by Mr. Miles, they raised funds for the purchase of a library \u2014 the first in Newark for Sabbath-school use. The school subsequently held its meetings in the school-house near the canal locks; in the upper part of the market-house; in a brick building be longing to David Moore, in the northeast corner of the public square; in a school-room fitted up by Mr. Miles, in the rear of the present church building, before its completion. From here it went into the present church building. There was considerable prejudice against the Sabbath-school in its early history here. A gentle man who was teaching school in this place in 1831, and who was strongly opposed to the institution of the Sabbath-school, announced, on a certain Mon day morning, that it was his intention to discipline by dismissing from his school all his scholars who had attended the Sabbath-school on the previous day; and, for the purpose of ascertaining who the offending parties were, required them to rise to their feet. Somewhat surprised to see that all the school, except his own two children, rose, and not wishing so suddenly to be thrown out of employ ment, he immediately said: \" )'ou can take your seats.\" In 1832 the school numbered eighty-nine pu pils and fourteen teachers. The school is at pres ent a large and flourishing one. The following gen tlemen have been superintendents: Lewis Godden, Robert C. Gist, Mark Howe, James Young, John Wolf, John Moore, Robert Milligan, E. J. Lewis, Henry S. Martin, L. P. Coman, T J. Davis, Rev. W. M. Robinson, George B. Wright, W. H. Wine gardner, Rev. H. M. Hervey, W. D. Hamilton, and the present pastor, Rev. R. R. Moore. The school is provided with a library of several hundred volumes. The Second Presbyterian Church. \u2014 The forego ing history of the First church alludes to the fact of the organization of the Second church in the simple statement that \"A series of difficulties ex tending through several years, culminated in De cember, 1836, in the withdrawal from this church of more than twenty members, who, with others, organized the Second Presbyterian church of this city.\" July 16, 1876, the pastor of the church, Rev. Howard Kingsbury, preached an historical sermon on the fortieth anniversary of the Second church, from which is gleaned the following history of that congregation. Stating the causes which led to the organization of this church as briefly and accurately as possible, it may be said the first disaffection in the old church in this place sprang up immediately upon the call extended to the Rev. Mr. Wylie, who was not the choice of a considerable number of the congregation. This was publicly known, and va rious inaffectual attempts were made to reconcile the disaffected members. At length, in February, 1836, disciplinary measures were brought against six prominent members of the church \u2014 Asa Beck with, James Nailer, Starr Baldwin, N. H. Seymour, Thomas H. Bushnell, and James Young. Of these, all but the last two effected a compromise with the session. Messrs. Bushnell and Young determined to stand trial. Their cases were finally settled in the presbytery in the spring of that year, that body not sustaining any of the charges brought against them. At this time the question of forming a separate church, which would not have been thought of a little while before, began to be agitated, and steps were taken in that direction. A petition was pre sented to an adjourned meeting of the presbytery, April 21, 1836, signed by \"fifty-one members and supporters of the church and congregation of Newark, praying to be set off as a Second church in Newark. It was moved and seconded that the petition be received, and after considerable discus sion the motion was put and carried in the affirma tive.\" \u2014 (Minutes, Presbytery of Lancaster, pp. 145, 146.) Notice was given that an appeal would be taken from this decision. Against the petition a remonstrance was presented, signed by a hun dred and twenty-eight members and supporters of the church of Newark. The matter was at length referred to a committee consisting of Revs. Sam-"], [570, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 560 uel W. Rose and Jacob Little, and Elder William Thompson, of Jersey. At a called meeting held in Newark, December 27, 1836, against the very assembling of which protests and appeals were presented by different members, a memorial was addressed to presbytery, signed by forty-five names, members and support ers of the church of Newark, asking to be organiz ed with all who may chose to associate with them, into a Second Presbyterian church in Newark, or the dissolution of the pastoral relation between the Rev. William Wylie and the church and congrega tion of Newark. \u2014 (Minutes Presbytery of Lancas ter, p. 171.) This was considered at length, and it was finally Resolved, that they grant the memorialists their request, \u2014 so far as it relates to the organization of a Second Presbyterian church in Newark. \u2014 (ibid., p. 172.) and the Revs. Roswell Tenney, William H. Beecher and Charles M. Putnam, with Elders Chester Wells and Jonas Ward were appointed a committee to organize the church. This duty they carried out faithfully on December 29, 1836. The sermon was preached by Rev. W. H. Beecher, who alone survives of this committee, from Romans 1:16-17. Thirty-one members of the church at Newark presented themselves, and were duly organized into the Second Presbyterian church. Their names as they appear on the journal of that day's proceedings are Henry Shurtz, James Nailer, Ma tilda Edwards, Ann Nailer, Ruth Stephenson, Sa rah Beckwith, Mary Baldwin, Sarah Smith, Eliza beth Breakbill, Thirza Gregory, Jonas Ward, Mary Houston, Sarah Steel, Charlotte Cook, Ann Mead, Mary Ann King, Benjamin Ells, James Young, Jane Doolittle, Sabra Ells, Sarah Young, Leah Hollar, Margaret Scott, Martha Seymour, Jennet Shurtz, Sarah Woods, N. H. Seymour, C. S. Gil bert, Starr Baldwin, Asa Beckwith, and Peter Breakbill. Jonas Ward, James Young and Asa Beckwith were elected ruling elders. Mr. Ward be ing an elder was installed, and the others ordained. The church was now organized and ready for work; but the matter did not rest here. An ap peal was taken from the decision of the presby tery, and a protest against their action in forming the Second church ; and from the decision of the synod, reversing the action of the presbytery, the session of this church took an appeal to the gen eral assembly. In May, 1838, however, the general assembly divided into two branches, known as old and new school. In the following fall the synod of Ohio divided at its meeting at Lancaster; and the new school presbytery of Lancaster held its first meeting, according to appointment, at Jersey, De cember nth of the same year. Although it was not the case with the synod at large that all who had been considered \"new measure\" men went with the new school, and all extreme Calvinists with the old; it is stated as nearly, if not exactly, the fact that all who had opposed the organization of this church formed the old school presbytery, while those who had favored it formed the new school. Naturally, therefore, this church sought the continued companionship and assistance of its tried friends. Thus, while the division of the church at large had nothing to do with the division of the Presby terian family in this place, it nevertheless came to pass that by this greater division all ecclesiastical opposition to this minor division was ended; and the Second Presbyterian church was duly recog nized by, and represented in, presbytery. The first services of the new church were held in the school-house in the rear of the old church. Without a pastor they enjoyed the occasional services of neighboring ministers, and at other times one of their number read a sermon. Late in April, r837, a young man, Alexander Duncan, who had been brought up in the city of Troy, New York, under the pastorate of Dr. Bee man, and by him prevailed upon to consecrate himself to the work of the ministry, was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Cincinnati. He was not ordained or installed, however, until some time later, being received from the pres bytery of Cincinnati, by the presbytery of Lan caster (new school) at its first meeting, December 11, 1838; and set apart to the ministry and in stalled pastor of this church, Thursday, April 4, 1839. Rev. W. H. Beecher preached the serm on The moderator, Rev. Jacob Little, presided and gave the charge to the people. The ordaining prayer yvas made by Rev. Samuel W. Rose."], [571, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 56i In the spring of 1837 an arrangement was made with the county commissioners for the use of a jury-room in the second story of the court house. This was fitted up at an expense of about a hundred dollars, with an unpainted pulpit and un painted pews, which afterwards did service in the basement of the first building erected. The sec ond year permission was given to use the same room a while longer. From this room the church was summarily ejected; being granted time barely to remove their furniture, it having been discov ered by the county commissioners that such an occupation of it by a religious society was a per version of its original design. At a meeting held May 29, 1838, a committee was appointed, consisting of James Young, E. S. Woods, and Jonas Ward, \"to fix a site for a church, and report plans and expense of house built of brick or wood.\" June 14th, it was determined to proceed at once. The yvest half of the east half of in-lot number twenty-five, together with a nar row strip running north, had been quietly secured by Mr. Young more than a year before, with refer ence to this object, and by him was delivered at cost, for the sum of five hundred and twenty-three dollars. A soliciting committee was appointed, consisting of Messrs J. Young, E. S. Woods, A. Beckwith, B. Sherwood, and A. C. Edgell, who weae enabled o tprocure, on the first subscription, the amount of two thousand four hundred and sixty-one dollars. Of the fifty-five names, three subscribed three hundred dollars each; two, two hundred; four, one hundred. The rest are smaller, running down to even two dollars. Among the original subscrip tions was one of an eight day clock, that was sold for thirty dollars. The gentleman who had charge of it when sold, took it, set it up on the mantel, wound it and set it going. That clock is said to have celebrated the occasion by striking, not twelve the first time, but a hundred and forty-four. It evidently did its best. July 26th, the following gentlemen were ap pointed a building committee: Messrs. Doolittle, Young, Beckwith, Seymour, and Woods; Mr. Seymour being appointed treasurer. All questions of detail were left to them, and on August 24th, they entered into contract with Messrs. Reeder & Rodgers for a frame building, \"thirty-eight feet by fifty-two feet, and twenty feet high, between sills and plates;\" the basement to be completed by December ist. It was not ready for use until February 17, 1839, when, with glad hearts, the church, who had mean time been worshipping in a large room in the sec ond story of Mr. Beckwith's store, -on the south side of the square, took possession for the first time of a church home they could call their own. A bass-viol that had been presented to the choir by Mr. Buckingham Sherwood, on condition that it should be used, had, unseen, lent its aid to music of that happy day; but on the next Sunday its presence was disclosed to the horror of one of the little original band of worshippers, who at once arose and withdrew, and never set foot again with in the desecrated walls. The efforts of her pastor to remove her prejudice were unavailing, she per sisting that she would never \"sit and see any one pretending to worship God by scraping on the Devil's backbone.\" March 15, 1839, the Second Presbyterian church was duly incorporated by an act of the legislature; Samuel D. King, John Metcalf, Alfred Doolittle, Asa Beckwith, Ezekiel S. Woods and James Young being the corporators. Divine service continued to beheld in the hum ble room just described, for a little over a year, when the audience-room above was completed, and on April 16, 1840, solemnly dedicated to God. The sermon on that occasion was preached by Rev. Addison Kingsbury, of Putnam, on the text, Exo dus 25:8. The first addition to the membership of the church was on the last Sabbath of May, 1837, when eleven united with it. During that year twenty-three were added, five of them on profes sion of their faith, making a total of fifty-two. There was a steady growth until 1848, the largest accession being in 1842, during which year the church enjoyed a visit from Rev. Dr. Lindsley, then president of Marietta college. The interest which had for a long time been increasing then culminated, and forty-five members were added, thirty of them on examination. The whole number added to the church under Mr. Duncan's ministry of nearly sixteen years was"], [572, "562 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. two hundred and sixteen, making in all two hun- dred and forty-seven members. January n, 1853, Rev. Mr. Duncan resigned his pastoral charge, having been chosen superintendent of the public schools of this city. His resignation was accepted at a meeting of the church and con- gregation held the next day, though the pastoral relation was not formally dissolved until the spring meeting of presbytery; and he continued to supply the pulpit mainly until the spring of 1854. In February, 1854, a proposition was made by the First church looking to the union of the two churches. The correspondence was friendly, but resulted in nothing; the main point at issue, so far as the resolutions of the respective parties indicate, being that of the ecclesiastical connection of the reunited church. Naturally the First church ad- hered to the old school presbytery of Zanesville; as naturally the Second church preferred the new school presbytery of Pataskala. Rev. Simon J. Humphrey, a graduate of Bow- doin college, Maine, in 1848, and of Andover seminary in 1852, preached here six Sabbaths early in the year 1854. A call was extended to him March 8th of that year, which, being accepted, he was ordained to the ministry, and installed pastor the eighth day of the following June; Professor Allen, of Lane seminary, preaching the sermon. That year the cholera prevailed here, and in the pastor's note-book is preserved this sad record; \"Sunday, August 27th. This is the cholera Sab- bath. Ten burials to-day.\" In the spring of 1856 the church was enlarged by an addition at the rear, giving about a hundred new sittings. At the same time a pipe organ, costing between six and seven hundred dollars, took the place of the cabinet-organ formerly employed. Services were held during this time in the city hall, beginning March 23rd; the enlarged church being occupied for the first time on June 1st. The trustees of the church in April, 1859, pur chased a house and lot adjoining the church for a parsonage, at the price of seventeen hundred dollars, to be paid in three yearly instalments. The whole number added to the church in Mr. Humphrey's pastorate of just seven years, was eighty-nine. Financially the report for this period is about as follows : Enlarging and repairing church, $1,205; organ> $677; parsonage (a small balance paid later), $1,700; current expenses, $5,800; benevolence, $2,287; total, $11,669.. In the spring of 1861, Rev. Mr. Humphrey, receiving a call from the First Congregational church of Beloit, Wisconsin, resigned the pastor ate of this church. The pulpit yvas supplied for a year, to May 1, 1862, by Rev. William Lusk, jr., and on October 14, 1862, a call was extended to, and accepted by, Rev. Rollin A. Sawyer. Mr. Sawyer is a graduate of Western Reserve college in 185 1, and of Union Theological semi nary, New York, in 1857. Prior to his settlement here, he had been pastor of the Westminster church, Yonkers, New York, from February 17, 1858. He was installed over this church January 1, 1863, and continued its pastor until January 16, 1866. Up to the close of his pastorate here, including the previous interim, when two were added, the whole number of additions to the church was forty-four. Total on church-roll to January, 1866, 380 Financially the report for the four years is about as follows: Current expenses $5,200 Benevolence 1,750 Total, $6,9S0 The vacant pulpit was not filled immediately. November 4, 1866, Rev. Daniel Tenney preached his first sermon here. A call was subsequently extended to him, which he accepted January 9, 1867. He was installed pastor of this church May 1, 1867; on which occasion Rev. D. E. Beach, of Granville, preached the sermon from the text, 2 Cor. 2; 15, 16. Rev. Addison Kings bury, D. D., of Putnam, charged the pastor, and Rev. Charles Putnam, of Jersey, who was present at the organization of the church, thirty years be fore, charged the people. In November of that year the very important step was taken to determine upon a new church building. On Saturday evening, November 2d, a number of prominent gentlemen, connected with this church, called, by invitation, upon the pastor, each one somewhat surprised at the presence of"], [573, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 563 others. The matter was discussed, and Mr. Tenny offered to make up the balance from the rest of the society, if they who were present would do about what he had in his thoughts assigned them. All promising not to be offended at his making figures for them, he read the supposed subscrip- tion. But let him describe the scene for himself, as he does in a letter received from him : \"Nobly did they respond with but slight variations from the estimates I had made. About twelve thousand dollars were pledged that night. It was a solemn and precious hour, and as we kneeled and thanked God, every heart was deeply moved. I shall never forget that night. God was there. The next day, the Sabbath, November 3d, I preached^from the text : ' Let us rise up and build.' On Monday I took the field to make up the balance of the subscription needed, and before night nearly twenty thousand dollars were pledged. Never, I think, were subscriptions more generously or more promptly pledged. I would like to mention the names of some of those brothers who joyfully made their offerings of thousands into the Lords treas- ury for that object, but it would be invidious. But I must speak of one person who was knowing to my plan, one indi- vidual who had earnestly advised me to move, and to move at once and heartily in the matter. That person was a woman. She insisted that it could be done, and that now was the time. She would say to me again and again, go forward, and you will succeed. That noble woman was Mother King. God bless her!\" A congregational meeting was held December 23, 1867, when the following gentlemen were ap- pointed a building committee: Messrs. William Shields, William A. King, esq., John McCune, William O. Bannister, Rev. Daniel Tenney, Albert Sherwood, John S. Fleek. The parsonage was moved from the corner to the rear of the lot, and made to front on Second street, and the church, instead of occupying its old position, was advantageously placed on the corner, fronting Church street. Services were held in tbe meantime in the old building, which was removed to where it now stands, and which has since be , come the property of the African Methodist Epis- copal church, and in the city hall. June 13, 1868, on a beautiful Saturday evening, the corner stone was laid with appropriaie cere- monies, when Rev. H. M. Hervey, of the First church conducted the devotional exercises, Mr. Matthew Newkirk read a historical statement of the church and Sabbath-school, Mr. Tenney de- livered an address, Waldo Taylor, esq., read a statement respecting the proposed building, and Rev. J. W. White, of the Methodist church, offered prayer. Thursday, January 28, 1869, the first services were held in the lecture room, consisting of a Sun day-school festival and dedication. The following Sabbath, January 31st, was rendered memorable by the reception of twenty new members, the celebra tion of the Lord's supper, a dedication sermon, and the raising of two thousand dollars. Anew bell, weighing twenty-one hundred pounds, was procured largely through the efforts of Miss Martha Scott (now Mrs. Osborn), and was raised lo its place May 20, 1870. That bell was rung so joyfully for the next two years that it prematurely cracked, and another was immediately obtained for it in exchange, weighing a little over fifteen hun dred pounds. Mr. Tenney resigned his pastoral charge March 8, 187 1, and removed to Troy. The whole number added to the church under his ministry was a hundred and thirty-four.

November 27, 1872, at the suggestion of the session, who tendered their resignation, the church, after much prayer and calm deliberation, adopted the system of term eldership, the session to be consti tuted of six elders, the term of office to be six years, an election of two elders to be held every two years."], [574, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 564 The financial report for the present period,\u2014 including pledges just secured for a debt of two thousand three hundred dollars still due on the finishing of the church, to be paid within a year, is substantially as follows: At a congregational meeting, March 4, 1873, it was determined to proceed to finish the church. In due time a subscription paper was circulated, and a building committee appointed, consisting of the following gentlemen: Messrs. Adam Fleek, T. L. Clark, George Sherwood, George Markley, C H. Newkirk, T. H. Sites,' J. H. McCune. On Sunday, April 12, 1874, the long looked for day arrived, when the audience-room should be consecrated to the worship of God. The sermon was preached by Rev. W. E. Moore, D. D., of Columbus, from Psalm 95, 6. The dedicatory prayer was offered by the pastor. Then the sacra ment of the Lord's supper was celebrated, Rev. Mr. Tenney conducting the service; and the ses sion of the First church, who had given up their own service to unite with this church on the joyful occasion, joined with this session in the distribu tion of the elements. Sixteen were received into the church, seven of them on profession of their faith. In the afternoon a Sunday-school dedication service was held, conducted by Mr. Tenney, and in the evening an historical address by Rev. Mr. Duncan. A brief description of the church building seems appropriate at this place. It is built of brick, with Ohio sandstone finishings. It is some what Gothic in architecture. Its extreme length is one hundred and six feet, and extreme width sixty-two feet two inches. ' The basement, entirely above ground, contains a lecture-room, with a seating capacity of three hundred and fifty; a conference-room, holding a hundred; two smaller rooms, the one the pastor's study, the other a parlor, and a library room; all, with the exception of the last, connected by slid ing-doors. The audience-room has a seating capacity of five hundred and fifty, with room to spare.

Mr. Baird, although himself at the time not a professor of religion, to introduce such an agency of use fulness into the church. Mr. Baird replied to his solicitation: \"Cannot you start one?\" He shrank from the responsibility, and the matter for the present dropped. When Mr. Miles became pastor, Mr. Young, having then become a member of the church, addressed an anonymous letter to him upon the same subject, which had the desired effect. On the next Sabbath a prayer-meeting was announced, and I suppose not a week has passed since that long-ago time, 1822, when there has not' been a prayer-meeting in this city. The Sabbath-school has always been a prosper ous institution, varying from time to time, but on the whole gaining in numbers and interest. It was organized in January, 1837, i. e. at the very begin ning of the church, by the Rev. James Hildreth, a young licentiate from the city of New York. The pastors of the church have all been Sunday school men, and the superintendents and teachers have been active, faithful and zealous. It has grown from an average attendance of about seven ty-five to over two hundred. According to the annual report of the secretary, Mr. Antone Weber, presented March 26, 1876, the school consisted of six officers and thirty teachers, twenty ladies and ten gentlemen. There are three bible classes, with an enrollment of forty-two, and an average attend ance of eighteen; the main school, with an enroll ment of ninety-six boys and one hundred and twenty-four girls, and an average attendance of fifty-six boys and seventy-five girls; and an infant class with an enrollment of seventy-three, and an average attendance of forty-five.

The whole amount contributed was two hundred and seventy dollars and thirty cents. The following is a nearly, if not quite, correct list of superintendents, with the dates of the be ginning of their service: Rev. Mr. McDonald, a Presbyterian, was the first preacher in Licking county. This was in 1802. In 1803 the Methodist Episcopal church organized the Hock-Hocking circuit, which embraced the territory, in part, of what now forms the counties of Fairfield, Licking, Muskingum, Coshoeton, Knox, Franklin, Pickaway, and Ross. Rev. Asa Shinn was appointed the intinerant to take charge of it, establish preaching places, organize classes, and generally minister to it. He made the cabin of Mr. Benjamin Green, in the valley of Hog run, a regular preaching place, which he visited once in four weeks, and where he instituted, in 1804, the first regular church organization in Licking county. It is probable that Mr. Shinn also preached about that time in the Licking valley, and, perhaps, in Newark, which had been laid out the year before (1802), but no record appears to that effect. The first man to preach in Newark was, probably, Rev. John Wright, a Presbyterian. This was in the summer of 1803. A sketch of Mr. Shinn's life will be found in the history of the Hog Run church, in Licking township. In the autumn of 1804, Mr. Shinn was trans ferred to Kentucky, and Revs. James Quinn and John Meeks took his place on the Hock-Hocking circuit. There is no record that they preached any where else in the county than in the little church at Hog run, but it is presumable that they occasion ally preached in Newark, but if they did they must have held the service under a tree, or in the cabin of some settler, as no building had been erected for church purposes, and was not erected for years afterwards. Mr. Quinn was continued upon this circuit, be ing re-appointed in 1805, but he was sent to the Scioto circuit when about one-half of his second year had expired, making his whole service on the circuit, a period of eighteen months, running into the early part of 1806. Before he left the village Newark was attached to it, and his congregation usually numbered \"from fifteen to thirty persons,\" says Mr. Smucker. Here then is the first evidence of the establishment of the first Methodist class in Newark. A small class existed here which Mr. Quinn left in 1806, composed of five or six persons, who met at the cabin of Abraham Wright, esq., an emigrant of 1802, from Washington county, Penn James Young 1837 Asa Beckwith 1840 N.

Newkirk 1875 Mr. Newkirk is the present superintendent. In addition to the home school, the church sus tained a mission in East Newark for ten years, from October, 1858, to April, 1868. The highest enrollment was in 1859 \u2014 one hundred and twenty six scholars, eleven teachers; Mr. J. D. Parsons, superintendent. It grew gradually smaller until it was re-organized in June, 1866, and its more than fifty scholars were placed under the care of a sin gle teacher, Miss Clara Knight, whose faithful ser vice, unassisted and often unappreciated, was finally terminated by an attack of sickness, which put an end to the school. Rev. Howard Kingsbury was succeeded in March, 1878, by Rev. George A. Beattie, who re mained until the summer of 1880. The debt of the church was canceled during his pastorate. The Methodist Episcopal Church of Newark. \u2014 Unfortunately the larger part of the history of this church has not been preserved. This is more to be regretted as this has generally been the pioneer church. In the advance of civilization the Methodist preachers were generally found on the picket line, and were the first to proclaim the Gos pel in the wilderness. This was not always the case, but if not the first, they were, at least, among the first, and for this reason the history of this church becomes a part of the history of the terri tory contiguous to its location. 26"], [576, "566 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. sylvania, who was at this period, and had been for some time, an acting justice of the peace. Rev. James Quinn, who organized this first Methodist class in Newark, was born in Washing ton county, Pennsylvania, April i, 1775, and en tered the itinerant ministry in May, 1799. He was appointed to Greenfield circuit in western Pennsylvania, but was also a missionary in the Hock-Hocking valley in December, 1799, and January, 1800, going as far as Lancaster. In 1801, he served Erie circuit, the Winchester circuit in Shenandoah valley, Virginia, in 1802, and Red stone circuit, in the Monongahela valley, Pennsyl vania, in 1803. The next year he erected a cabin in the woods in Fairfield county, near the present village of Pleasantville, which he made his home. It was the work of twenty-six days to ride around his circuit, and he was allowed but two days at home. Mr. Quinn was a faithful and efficient minister, and continued his ministerial duties until 1842. He died at his residence in Highland county, Ohio, December 1, 1847, at the age of nearly seventy-three. Rev. John Meeks, Mr. Quinn's cotemporary, came from Western Virginia, above Wheeling. He remained many years in the itinerancy, but no record of his life and services has been obtained. In 1805, Rev. Joseph Thrap came into the county, and Rev. Joseph Williams was appointed to the Hock- Hocking circuit. A biographical sketch of Mr. Thrap is given in the history of Hanover township, where he lived and established a church. It is not unlikely that he preached many times to the class in Newark. Mr. Williams also preached here at the same time. In 1806, quite a number of preachers of differ ent denominations made their appearance in New ark and vicinity. Among them was Rev. John Emmett, a Methodist, who preached a number of sermons under a tree which stood on the public square. Rev. Peter Cartwright also made his ap pearance on the Hock-Hocking circuit, taking the place of Mr. Meeks, who, by reason of failing health, was unable to keep his appointments. At that date the following names appear as members of the Methodist society here. These were prob ably the organizers of this church: James Stewart, Mrs. Stewart, Jane Wilson, Mr. Couch, James Stewart, jr., Martin Lincoln, Aaron Baker, Mrs. Baker and Benjamin Wilcox, a colored youth brought to Ohio from Virginia, by Captain Archi bald Wilson. Three gentlemen from New Eng land, named Curtis, Mallery and Petty, were soon added to the above list, but not long after a schism sprang up in the little church which led to the seces sion of Aaron Baker and a number of others. Mr. Emmett officiated as chaplain on the Fourth of July, 1807, the first Fourth of July ever celebrated in Licking county. He spent the subsequent years of his life in the Scioto valley, and represented Pickaway county several sessions in the legislature. Rev. James Axley was assigned to this circuit in 1806, and in 1807 Revs. Joseph Hays, James King and Levi Shinn, brother of Asa, the two former having charge of the Hock-Hocking circuit. In 1808 Revs. Ralph Lotspeitch and Isaac Quinn came as regular Methodist itinerants. The former was a minister of note, who performed much pastoral labor among the Methodists in this county during this and succeeding years. In 1809 Revs. Benjamin Lakin and John John son were ministers on the Hock-Hocking circuit, and, of course, supplied the Newark congregation. About that time the first court house in this county was erected \u2014 a log building \u2014 on the public square, and this was thereafter used by all denominations for many years, for religious meetings. One of the most prominent of the early Meth odist ministers was Rev. Noah Fidler, who came to this vicinity, settling a few miles south of New ark in 181 1. He entered the Methodist itinerancy in 1 80 1, serving the Frederick, Pittsburgh, Erie, Clarksburgh, Botetourt and Staunton circuits, in the order named, until 1808, when he retired from the labors of a circuit preacher, and became a local minister in the Methodist church, continuing in that relation until his death, which took place in Miami county, Ohio, in 1849, at the age of seventy-one. In 1823 this church was included in what was called Granville circuit; in 1834 in Newark circuit, and in 1840 it was made into a station, and Rev. Cyrus Brooks appointed as pastor. Rev. Noad Fidler lived near this place after retir ing from the regular ministry, and was one of the leading members of the society until 1834. The"], [577, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 5^7 appointments were as follows, according to tradi tion, from 1823 to 1828: In 1823-4, William Cunningham and Charles Thorne; in 1824-5, Ed ward Taylor and H. S. Fernandes; in 1825-6, Samuel Hamilton, Z. H. Costen; in 1826-7, Samuel Hamilton, Curtis Goddard; in 1827-8, Jacob Hooper. On the first page of an old record appears the following subscription form, used for soliciting money for the first Methodist \"meeting house\" in Newark : \"Methodist Episcopal Meeting House. \u2014 A subscrip tion addressed to the generous people of the town of Newark and its vicinity for the sole purpose of obtaining funds and materials for building said house in the town of Newark, on a lot obtained Irom Thomas Reed, on Fourth street, a few rods north of the old burying-ground \u2014 We, the subscribers, from motives of friendship to the cause of religion and morality, and willing to give our aid for the promotion of the town of Newark, do covenant and agree that we will pay the sums we hereunto subscribe to our names_to the trustees of said house! which said trustees shall be under bonds to make the best use of in building the house in a good, substantial manner, accord ing to the best of their judgment. \"January 16, 1828.\" The following are a few of the principal sub scriptions: James Hays, fifty dollars; Martin Lincoln, fifty dollars ; James Bramble, forty-five dollars; William Stanberry, fifty dollars; Hugh Allen, tyventy-five dollars. The remainder were from fifteen dollars down to one dollar. Total subscription, seven hundred and seventy-one dol lars : January 12, 1830, the following minute appears on the trustees' book: \"The following is an abstract of the report of the acting committee of the Methodist Episcopal meeting-house, in the town of Newark, to the trustees of the same, relative to the cost, etc., up to the present date, a copy of which was pub lished in the Newark Advocate and Newark Gazette: The contractor for the brick work of the house was Ebenezer Chadwick, and for the carpenter work the firm of Bramble & Wilson. The house was formally received by the trustees and settlement made May 4, 1829. The preacher in charge at this time was Rev. Jacob Hooper. The trustees who began the erection of the meet ing-house were James Hays, James Bramble, John Evans, Thomas Taylor, John Channel, Thomas Atherton and Thomas Parker. The lot (the site of the present church) cost fifteen dollars, and the deed was made August 6, 1828. The following subscription paper is interesting as showing the progress of matters: \"To the ladies of Newark and vicinity: \u2014 The liberality of the ladies, in matters of public importance and utility, we believe has never been appealed to in vain. In those things that per tain to the convenience and ornament of society, they are ever ready to contribute their proportion, and from none are dona tions for such purposes more appropriate. It is proposed to purchase a bell for the use of this town generally, to be hung in the cupola of the Methodist church, to be rnng twice every day. The cost of the bell will be about fifty cents per pound; conse quently the more there is subscribed, the larger and more useful will be the bell purchased. From the munificence of the ladies in the vicinity, and in the town of Newark, we certainly hope to be able to effect this laudable object. Therefore, we, the subscribers, agree to pay the several sums annexed to our names. One hundred and nine dollars were received. In the fall of 1829, Rev. James Gilruth was ap pointed to Newark circuit, with Jacob Hooper as colleague. Leroy Swormsted was presiding elder. There were at that time sixty-nine members. In 183 1 H. S. Fernandes was appointed to the charge, and remained two years and was followed by J. W. Gilbert. The church, up to 1833, seems to have been in an unfinished condition, and another sub scription was taken to complete it. In 1834-5 bills were granted to the amount of four hundred and fifty-four dollars, which shows the cost of the building to have been, including the bell, one thou sand five hundred and eighty-eight dollars. On the first of August, 1835, a property was purchased of Jabez Edwards \"on the northwest corner of the town, for a parsonage, for which the sum of four hundred and fifty dollars was paid.\" The Sunday school at this time numbered one hundred and five, which is the first report in the hands of the pastor.

G. West and F. A. Lowry. In 1847 Methodism felt strong enough to sus tain two churches. Rev. E. B. Chase was the minister. A frame church and lot located on the north side of Main street, between First and Second streets, was purchased of the Universalists, for which they paid eight hundred dollars, and upon which they bestowed twenty-two hundred dol lars in remodeling. It was dedicated to the wor ship of God in the fall of 1848; the sermon was preached by Bishop Hamline. At the following session of the Ohio conference, which met in Newark in 1848, the church was divided. Rev. William F. Stewart was appointed pastor to the \" eastern charge,\" and Rev. E. B. Chase was ap pointed to the \"western charge.\" Thei following is a list of appointments during the twelve years of its existence, viz.: William F. Stewart, one year; John Dillon, one year; George W. Brush, two years; H. T. Magill, one year; James Mitchell, two years; J. H. Creighton, two years; W. T. Hand, one year; E. V. Bing, one year. These two churches remained distinct and sep arate until 1860, when they were consolidated. In 1864 the erection of the present edifice was projected. Rev. L. Taft was the minister. It is situated on the ground occupied by the old church. The old structure was removed, and dur ing the four years succeeding the congregation worshipped in the house used formerly by the Eastern congregation. After four years the base ment was ready for use, and was dedicated to the purpose of divine worship. Rev. L. Cunningham was minister. The dedicatory sermon was preached by Bishop D. W. Clark. A heavy debt was contracted in the erection of the building which greatly embarrassed the society. In 1874 the audience-room was completed and dedicated. Rev. E. I. Jones was the minister. The debt contracted in the first building of this church still hung upon it as a great incubus, amounting at times to ten thousand dollars. It was not until 1879 that this heavy burden was re moved. The threat of a foreclosure of a mort gage held by an insurance company in St. Louis, Missouri, brought the whole church suddenly to its feet. A meeting was called, and it was deter mined to make a final effort to discharge the debt. The thirtieth day of April was set apart as a day of prayer. From nine o'clock in the morning un til ten o'clock at night the voice of supplication was heard in the church. One lady said during these services: \"At these altars I was dedicated to God in baptism, by my parents, when I was an infant. At the same altars I gave my hand to the minister as a member of the church, and here I took the sacred vows of marriage, and I had hoped that here my funeral rites might be per formed, and must it now be forfeited and lost to the church.\" Before the meeting closed it was apparent that success would follow the efforts. The community was thoroughly in sympathy with the distressed Methodist church. The people, without respect to what church they might belong, said: \"No, the Methodist church cannot be sold for debt.\" Mr. A. B. Clark, editor of the Ameri can, when the minister, Rev. Orville J. Nave, re lated to him the danger to which the church was exposed said, at the same time bringing his fist down upon the table, \"By George! that cannot be done,\" and the whole city and county said amen, by willing offerings. In ninety-two days the whole amount needed, eight thousand five hundred dol lars, was in the hands of the church treasurer and the debts cancelled. Too much cannot be said in praise of the unity of sentiment which prevailed among Christian people, and the liberality of many who were members of no church, in work ing this society out of its crisis. Much praise has justly been accorded to the minister for the suc cessful teimimition of this work. Mr. Isaac Smucker writes as follows regarding the first Sunday-school of this church. It is al most unnecessary to add that it has been kept up since that day and is now in a flourishing condi tion: \"In the spring of 1831, now almost fifty years ago, there was but one church edifice in Newark, and that was in an unfinished condition, with its rough brick walls unplastered, and using slab benches instead of pews. This was the Methodist church, which stood upon or near the site of the present one, corner of"], [579, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 569 Church and Fourth streets. The community generally had contributed to its construction, and it was then being occupied jointly every alternate Sabbath by the Methodibt'Episcopal so- ciety and by the Protestant Episcopal congregation, then recent- ly organized, whose ministrations were conducted by Rev. C. P. Bronson. Both congregations being so small that neither could well sustain a Sunday-school alone, it was on consultation decided to concentrate the efforts and labors of both, and of such as were not of either congregation, in organizing a union Sunday-school. This was done by the election of Dr. Daniel Marble, of the Episcopal congregation, president of the organ- ization, and Mr. Isaac Smucker treasurer. The names of the vice-president and secretary are not remembered, though it is believed that James Parker was chosen vice-president, and Miss Mary Ann Davis secretary. Mr. Milton Moore was the super- intendent. He was of the Methodist church, and was a young man of most exemplary conduct and deportment, much given to active benevolence and good works. Al! the officers of this early-time union Sunday-school of half a century ago, so far as they are remembered by the only two resiaent survivors (Mrs. Dr. Marble and the treasurer), were teachers, as were also Miss Amanda Holmes, Mrs. Robert Hazlett and Mrs. Dr. Marble. The class of the last named, after her resignation, was taught by her sister, Henrietta Trowbridge, who subsequently became the wife of Mr. Milton Moore, both yet living and enjoying a \"green old age\" (almost octogenarians) at Ra- cine, Wisconsin. After a successful career of a number of years, this union school came to be the Methodist Sunday- school by the withdrawal of those of Protestant Episcopal pro- clivities, who organized one in connection with that congrega- tion, which meanwhile had built a church edifice. It may be proper to remark that there was in this school a preponderance of Episcopal sentiment and influence, and hence the adoption and use therein of the Sunday-school ritual and liturgy of that denomination. And it may also appropriately be said that this union Sunday-school, although of \"ye olden time,\" was not the first, but the second established in Newark, the First Presbyte- rian church having some years before organized one, which was in operation when this one was started, and which held its meetings in the second story of our first market-house, that stood in the middle of West Main street, facing the public square, between the Newkirk and Patton corners, and which still lives, as does also the continuation of the union Sunday- school of 1831.\" The Fourth Street Baptist church is now located on the corner of Granville and North Fifth streets. It was organized in 1828, at the corner of Third and Main streets, by Rev. James Beerry. The fit st members or this church were Joseph Coffman, John Vance, Peter Coffman, Margaret Coffman, Mrs. Vance, Mr. Kimpton, Mrs. Kimp ton, Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong, H. Gregory and wife, Catharine Platto, Daniel Warren and wife, and some others. This society erected its first church in 1837, on Fifth street, just north of the canal, now occupied Jby Foos' carriage shop. This answered the pur- poses of the society until 1874, when the present magnificent brick structure was erected, and which cost twenty-eight thousand dollars. The pastors besides Mr. Berry, have been Revs. H. Gear, D. E. Thomas, Granger, Benjamin Thom as, Andrews, Lamb, Clouse, Wooster, Abbott, Gates, Miller and Owens. The present member ship is about two hundred and eighty. The organization of the Sunday-school was prob ably coeval with that of the church, and has always mantained a vigorous existence, numbering at pres ent, about two hundred pupils. Mr. George Blood is superintendent. Protestant Episcopal : \u2014 The early beginnings of this church in Newark are of sufficiently modern date to be in the memory of many now living, yet it is difficult to get at anything very tangible be fore the regular records in the diocesan journals. There was, however, occasional preaching, at long intervals, from time to time, for years before there was any church building or even organization; the congregation being gathered at private resi dences, the court room, or the house of another de nomination. Of those who thus preached were Bishop Chase, his son, Philander, and the Rev. Doctor Doddridge; and these, perhaps, only when they passed through Newark in their journeys to and from places of more note. In 1826 this was regarded as a favorable point for the establishment of a church, and one was organized by Bishop Chase. It was represented the next year in the convention by Judge Holmes. It was placed under the missionary care of Rev. N. G. Baldwin, in connection with Zanesville and Granville; hence, having but one-third of his time. The next preacher in charge, after a long vacancy, was the Rev. C. P. Bronson; Rev. R. T. Rogers followed him. The pastorate of these two clergy men, besides being short (only a few months each), was unfortunate, and little or nothing was done till 1S33, when the Right Rev. C. P. Mcllvaine, on his way to Gambier from his consecration in the east as bishop, remained in Newark two days, preaching each evening and urging the erection of a church. The record of this visit is as follows: \"The churches of the Methodist and Presbyterian congrega tions were kindly offered for the use of the Episcopalians in"], [580, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 57\u00b0 Instead of demanding four thousand dollars, as he might justly have done, he settled his claim for half that sum. The parish gained in numbers and influence under the rectorship of Mr. Denison. Following is a list of the ministers who succeed- Mr. Denison: W. H. Newman. 1837; John Ufford, 1840; G. Denison (second term), 1841; S. A. Bronson, 1850; John Swan, 1851; F. B. Nash, 1852; Henry Blackaller, 1855; H. B. Wray, 1858; J. W. McCarty, 1859; Rev. William Bower, C. S. Bates, D.D., and Rev. F. M. Hall, the present minister, who took charge in December, 1878. In the history of this church, as in that of every other Episcopal church in this part of Ohio, the name of Bishop Chase was closely identified, and his influence all-powerful in its establishment. His history has been written, and will not be re ferred to here, but the herculean labors of this good man were simply astonishing. His greatness and power; the good he accomplished, and his many virtues are not as well understood and ap preciated as they should be; but his name will go down in history among the greatest and best of Ohio's pioneers. The present membership of this church is about one hundred and seventy-five. The establishment of the Sabbath-school was probably coeval with that of the church, and has been maintained with a good degree of regularity since. Its membership is at present about one hundred and seventy-five. Mr. John H. Franklin is one of the most influ enti alof the Sabbaih-school workers in this church. The Welsh Calvinistic Methodist church of Sharon valley. \u2014 In 1832, William T. Williams, an immigrant direct from Wales, and James Evans and Robert Walker, Welshmen from Oneida county, New York, settled in the \"Sharon valley,\" a few miles from Newark, in the direction of the Welsh Hills settlement. At this time there was no regular Welsh preaching in Licking county, and hence the foregoing persons united temporarily with the Eng lish Congregational church of Granville. In the spring of 1833, the settlers in Sharon, with other families direct from Wales, who located in the valley, united with Walter and Nicodemus. Newark. I preached once in each and then held a meeting at the house of Mr. Hazlett. The meeting was small but spirited, and one thousand one hundred dollars pledged for building.\" The parish being without a rector, no further progress was made until the next year, 1834, when Rev. G. Denison, a professor of Kenyon college, Gambier, taking charge, immediate steps were taken for building a church. The following are the names of those who subscribed for the erection of the present building: George Baker, Elijah Cooper, Alexander Holmes, Daniel Marble, Israel Dille, Daniel Duncan, C. W. Searle, L. J. Haughey, Adam Fleek, S. R. Conner, T. J. Christian, S. M. Browning, J. E. Walker, Thomas Morris, James Bramble, Woodford Owens, John N. Wilson, Albert Sherwood, James M. Taylor, Daniel Wilkins, D. S. Wilson, W. D. Ingman, Rich ard Harrison, Asahel Dunham, John I. Mooney, Smith Allen, Robert Hazlett, Betsy Rowe, John Boston, Charles Hoover, A. Pier, Nathan King, Joel Arnold, E. S. Woods, John Moore, George McMullen, Henry Smith, Thomas Rowe, Horace Gregory, Henry Lemley, John Hollister, James Parker, Amos H. Caffee, James Holmes, James Young, B. W. Brice, George Hogg, Samuel Dewees, Daniel Gardiner, Martin Lincoln, C. M. Giddings, Robert Bryden, H. S. Sprague, Robert Davidson, and W. G. Oatman. In 1836, the neat Gothic church on Second street was consecrated. The entire charge and responsibility of its erection had been thrown upon Mr. George Baker. The estimated cost of the buiding to be erected was two thousand six hun dred dollars; but Mr. Baker, with changes, addi tions and improvements ran up the bills to three times that sum. On being expostulated with, his reply was: \"What difference does It make; do you doubt my ability or willingness to pay all this addi tional expense? All I have belongs to the church.\" Under such protestations the fears of the members subsided, for Mr. Baker was wealthy, without heirs, and a man of his word. But the best of inten tions sometimes comes to naught through misfor tune. Entering into an unsuccessful business partnership, this good friend of the church became insolvent, and the debt passed into the hands of one who held the vestry responsible \u2014 Mr. N. B. Hogg. This gentleman, however, was generous."], [581, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 57i Griffiths (immigrants of 1815) in establishing a Welsh Sabbath-school at the old stone school house, two miles northeast of Granville, on the Utica road. This was the pioneer Welsh Sabbath school in Licking county, and probably in Ohio. These settlers also sustained a regular weekly Welsh prayer meeting. In October, 1834, Rev. Edward Jones traveled on foot from his home in Cincinnati, to preach a few sermons to his countrymen in Sharon valley and Granville. This feat of clerical pedestrianism was repeated by him in 1835. During this visit he organized, October 25th, at the before mentioned stone school-house, the pioneer Welsh church of Licking county, in which he had the assistance of Rev. William Morgan, recently from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but living, at this time, at the Mary Ann furnace, The original members were William T. Williams, Mrs. Williams, James and Mrs. Evans, Alban Al bans, Mrs. Albans, John J. and Mrs. Evans, Robert Walter, William Parry, William Lewis, Mrs. Lewis, Jenkin Hughes, Nathaniel Davis, Mrs. Davis, Miss Albans and Miss Jane Davis. Rev. William Parry was licensed as a minister of the Gospel at this meeting. Rev. William Morgan was employed as settled pastor of the church. Rev. William Parry occasionally supplied the pulpit until after his ordination, in 1838, when he became the settled minister, and remained such until 1853, a period of fifteen years. In 1836 the society purchased, for a nominal sum, a lot for a church, on which they erected a frame building (the first in the neighborhood), twenty-one by thirty feet, which was finished in 1837, at a cost of three hundred and twenty-one dollars and eighty-nine cents, besides gratuitous labor performed by friends of the enterprise. This was the first Welsh Calvinistic Methodist church built in Ohio. There are now more than thirty. This church edifice was dedicated June 25, 1837, by Rev. Dr. Rowlands, of New York city, who was reputed to be one of the most eminent divines in his denomination, and whose character is known to all who are familiar with the religious literature of Wales. In 1852, Rev. Joseph E. Davis succeeded Will iam Parry as the settled minister. He was followed in 1856 by Rev. E. T. Evans, who sustained that relation until 1867, when William Parry again took charge. The original elders, elected in 1835, were Will iam T. Williams, James Evans and Alban Albans. Those subsequently elected were John J. Evans and Robert Walter in 1842, and David Hughes in 1859. The Sabbath-school has been regularly sus tained from its establishment, in 1833, to the pres ent time. The services in this church have always been conducted in the Welsh language. This is properly the pioneer Welsh church in Licking county, because the Baptist church on the Welsh Hills, although organized in 1808, nearly thirty years before this one, is but partially Welsh, its public ministrations having generally been con ducted in the English language, and only occasion ally in Welsh. It is probable, however, that a ma jority of its members had been natives of Wales or of Welsh parentage. The original church build ing is still occupied by this church. The Welsh Calvinistic Methodist churches of Newark and Granville were, to some extent, branches of this church. The St. John's German Lutheran church was probably organized as early as 1835, by Heinrirh Rickenbach and a few others. Their first meetings were held in a school-house which stood on the rear end of the first Presbyterian church lot. They rented this building for their purposes and held meetings here several years, and although no record appears, the probability is that Mr. Rickenbach preached for them in these earlier years. In 1841 they were strong enough to erect a small brick chuich on South Fifth street, on the site of the present building. The first officers of this church were Heinrich Rickenback, president; David Fisher, treasurer; Franz Boedel, secretary; and Jacob Grasser, Jacob Paul, Carl Frederick Boettcher and John Ehrgott, elders. The present brick church was erected in 1870, and is surmounted by a chime of three bells. For the last three years, the church being somewhat in debt, has not felt able to employ a minister, and Mr. F. Kochendorfer has officiated in that capacity free of charge. As their debts are about cancelled"], [582, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 572 they have employed the Rev. L. Hass, who will soon take charge. There are about one hundred members connected with the church at present. A Sunday-school has been maintained since the or ganization of the church. The Welsh Calvinistic Methodist church of Newark. \u2014 Rev. William Parry, of Granville, preached in Newark in August, 1836, at the house of Mr. Thomas Hughes, which stood on the lot north of the American house, owned by Andrew Smucker. This, it is said, was the first Welsh ser mon preached in Newark. Few, if any other Welsh families, then resided in Newark. The text was from Luke xii. 32: \"Fear not, little flock.\" From this time until the autumn of 1840, there was Welsh preaching occasionally; a school-house south of the canal being used for that purpose, as well as for the purposes of a Sabbath-school, which was early established. The Welsh citizens in town and country wor shipped together, and in 1840-41, erected a church on Granville street, at a cost of five hundred and fifty-five dollars and eighty-one cents. It was fin ished in May, 1841, and a church was duly organ ized May 28, 1841, with twenty-four members. Rev. William Parry ministered to them occasion ally, until September of the same year, when Rev. Hugh E. Rees, recently from Llanderfel, Wales, was called as settled pastor. Thomas Hughes and Morgan Williams were elected deacons, and Thomas Hughes, William Parry, Morgan Williams, Timothy Winston, Rich ard Watkins, Thomas Dowell and Enos Owens, were elected trustees. During this year, a valua ble accession to the church was Deacon Robert Owens, of Montgomeryshire, Wales, and Deacon Edward Brown and family, and a number of other families strengthened the church in 1844. In January, 1845, a difficulty occurred in the church, and Rev. H. E. Rees and most of the con gregation removed to a brick school-house on the east side of Mt. Vernon street, and there, on Sun- day, January 12, 1845, established themselves as a church. The minority that remained, consisting of eight or ten members, retained possession of the church. Those removing to the school-house soon pur chased that building, paying for it three hundred and eighty dollars. This served their purpose un til 1S56, when a new church was built on Elm street at a cost of a little more than two thousand three hundred dollars, nearly three hundred dollars of which were contributed by those outside the church. Mr. Rees continued his ministrations until 1848, when he removed to Cincinnati. Rev. Hugh Roberts succeeded him, and remained until July, 1852, when Rev. Joseph E. Davies took charge, and continued his services until the spring of 1855. He was followed by Rev. E. T. Evans and Rev. Mr. Roberts. The services in this church are conducted in the Welsh language. A Sabbath-school has been connected with the church since its establishment, and has generally been a large, active one. That portion of the congregation which retained the church on Granville street kept up a separate organization some time, perhaps two years, but gradually grew weaker until it ceased to exist. Many of its members joined the seceding branch, which was recognized as the legitimate church. The Welsh Congregational church of Newark. \u2014 Rev. James Davis, from the Welsh settlement on Owl creek, preached the first Welsh Congregational sermon in Newark, about 1837. Thomas D. Jones and Nicodemus Griffiths who lived a few miles northwest of Newark, and who were very decided Congregationalists, were the first to move in the matter of organizing this church. Learning that several Welsh families of their faith had settled here and in the neighborhood, they called upon them, and the interview resulted in the appointment to meet at the house of David Jones in Lockport to consider the subject. This meeting was held early in 1841, and was attended by Rev. Rees Powell, of Delaware county, and Rev. Seth Howell (a Presbyterian minister), who was a sojourner in the neighbor hood at the time, David Jones, T. D. Jones, Thomas Rees, David Lewis and Thomas Roberts with their families; also Mr. Evan W. Evans and Titus and Joshua Davis."], [583, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 573 An adjourned meeting was held the next day, at the house of Thomas Rees in Newark, where the Welsh Congregational church was organized. Thomas D. Jones, David Lewis and Thomas Rees were elected deacons. They soon after purchased a frame church build ing on Mt. Vernon street, furnished with ordinary wooden seats, and old ten-plate Mary Ann furnace stoves, for a little less than five hundred dollars. They took possession March 3, 1841, and elected David Jones, Evan W. Evans, Thomas Roberts, Thomas D. Jones, David Lewis, Watkin Watkins and Thomas Rees, trustees. Sabbath services were conducted by Rev. John Powell, assisted by Rev. Thomas W. Evans after his arrival from Wales, in July of this year. These joint labors were continued until 1843, when Rev. Jenkin Jenkins was chosen the regular pastor; he served, however, but one year, and was followed, in 1846, by .Thomas W. Evans, who remained until 1856, and was succeeded for a few months by Rev. Rees M. Evans. Rev. David R. Jenkins then became pastor, and so continued until his death, which occurred March 11, 186 1. Rev. David Price was elected pastor in October, 1862, and re mained until March, 1S69. In 1867 this_ society erected a fine brick church, costing seven thousand dollars. Weekly prayer meetings and a Sabbath-school have been regularly maintained since the organiza tion of the church. The pulpit and other services have generally been conducted in the Welsh language. The African Methodist Episcopal church is located on Church street, between First and Second. Its early history rests mostly on tradition, but the organization existed as early as 1840. It was probably organized here about or before that time. Prior to its organization the few colored people in Newark attended other churches, and their chil dren the Sunday-schools of the white people. The names of the original members of this organization cannot be ascertained; nor those of the ministers who were influential in bringing it into existence. Some of the early ministers, however, were Revs. George Coleman, Ratliff, Major J. Wilkinson, William Newman, Turner Roberts and Mr. Peters. Probably one or more of these were influential in the organization and establishment of the church. It was more than twenty years after the organiza tion was effected, before they had a church they could call their own; meanwhile they rented rooms of buildings in various places. About 1861 or 1862 they purchased a lot for seventy-five dollars, upon which they erected the small building called the \"Colored Chapel,\" which they occupied two or three years, and sold. They then rented and oc-' cupied the Baptist church two or three years, when they purchased the present building and lot. This building had been used as a church by the Second Presbyterians, and had been removed by that society in order to erect upon their lot the present beautiful structure. The lot and old building cost the colored people one thousand six hundred dol lars; they repaired it, and as it stands, it has cost them about two thousand five hundred dollars. The society is well established, strong and active, both in church and Sunday-school. The church membership, proper, is about forty, but the con gregation is large. The Sunday-school was organized in 1844, by William Henry and George Roots, two colored men, in a room south of the canal, then used by the society as a place of meeting for worship. This school went down once or twice, and was resuscitated, but has been for many years estab lished on a permanent basis. The membership is about thirty. St. Frances de Sales church: \u2014 The first written records of the Catholic congregation of Newark date back only to 1844, at which time, under the administration of Rev. I. Lamy, now archbishop of San Francisco, the first church edifice was erected, fronting on Granville street. As early, however, as 1S36, Rev. D. Young, of Washington, District of Columbia, visited Newark on horseback, on his way to Somerset and Cincin nati, dispensing the sacramuits of the church, and attending the sick calls along the canal, then being built. The same gentleman is also remembered as having about that time given lectures in the old court house on the square. Among the early members of the church, and"], [584, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 574 contributors to the erection of the frame building, now used as a barn, and standing on the rear of the church lot, are found the names of William Stanbery, Bradley Buckingham, E. McCarthy, Jonas Maurath, M. Morath, E. Koos, J. Buckell, Patrick Connelly, and Wilson and McMillen, some of whom are yet living in the city. From 1844 to 1848, Revs. D. Senez, I. Lamy, A. P. Anderson, W. Schonat, and J. T. Boulger, attended the congregation in succession, until a regular pastor was appointed in the person of Rev. J. Branneinan, who remained from 1848 to 1854, and who died at Rockaway, New York, in 1876. In 1854, Rev. F. Bender was appointed by Arch bishop Purcell, to the Newark parish, which com prised the Linnville, Jacksontown, Natchez, Kir kersville, Mattingly, and Jersey settlements. In time the old church on Granville street be came inadequate for the accommodation of the growing congregation, and steps were taken to erect the present substantial structure, the corner stone of which was laid about 1860, by Archbishop Purcell. Soon after the foundation of this church was laid, a heavy rain came on, and the gutters being blocked by building material, the water ran in and undermined one corner, causing it to give way; which circumstance gave rise to considerable seel ing against Father Bender, then pastor, and who was superintending the work. As the building was without much architectural beauty the congre gation thought it should be, at least, solid; but Father Bender intended the building should answer the purposes of a school-house and church com bined, and its long service for these purposes has fully tested its strength and justified the faith of the builder. Rev. Mr. Bender's efficiency being appreciated at headquarters, he was appointed to the task of superintending the erection of St. Edward's church, in Cincinnati, and in retiring from the pastorate of this church, generously relin quished all claims against it for money he had advanced. He was succeeded by Rev. L. Cartu yvels, December 19, 1863. A school-house had been built by Rev. F. Ben der as early as 1858. Rev. Cartuyvels remod elled it, put a large addition to it, and transformed it into a parsonage, having removed the schools to the west side of the church building. He also renovated and added to the comfort and conveni ence of the church by painting, putting pine floors in place of brick, placing furnaces in the basement and making various other changes, requiring an outlay of a considerable amount of money. A lottery scheme was started by the church, which was successful in discharging a portion of this indebtedness. Some dissatisfaction, however, ex isted in the congregation, and this, together with the fact that Rev. Cartuyvels, although having assistants at various times, among whom was Rev. P. T Daly, was no longer able to attend to his duties on account of age, and infirmities, caused his removal, and Rev. N. Pilger was appointed in his place. During these years the school had been sustained first under private teachers, then under the care of the sisters of charity, who, from their little earnings and charity fairs, succeeded in time in buying a lot on the corner of Granville and Pearl streets. This society, leaving Newark to make way for the sisters of St. Dominie, sold this lot to the pastor, Rev. N. Pilger. Mr. Pilger was succeeded in 1874, by Rev. L. DeCailly; the present pastor. This gentleman first paid the debts of the church, then removed the old buildings to the rear of the lot, and put a new floor in the church edifice, making it two stories. He then erected the present beautiful brick par sonage, on the corner of Granville and Pearl streets, and both spiritually and financially lifted the church out of many of its former difficulties. The present membership is about sixteen hun dred, \u201e of whom about one thousand or eleven hundred are communicants. The school attend ance in four rooms averages two hundred and fifty scholars, the larger boys being under the charge of M. F. Kirnes. About three hundred children belong to the Sunday-school. From past progress, it is expected that the strength of the church will so increase in a few years that a new church edifice will be needed, and with this view the church has secured and holds in reserve a beautiful lot, fronting Granville and Sixth streets. The German Methodist Episcopal church is"], [585, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 575 located on Fourth, south of the canal. Its organi zation dates back to about the year 1847, and Rev. Conrad Gahn was, probably, more influential than any other person in its establishment. The original members were Mr. Imhoff and wife, Mr Young and his daughter Caroline, Mrs. Kirsch John Reiff and wife, and a little later, Joshua Zart man and wife, and others. Their first meetings were held in the school-house in that part of town, and continued there uutil 1856, when they erected a frame church building, at a cost of one thousand four hundred and eight dollars, which is yet in use. The first pastor was Rev. Nippart, who is now in Germany. Conrad Gahn succeeded him. The present minister is Rev. Trinker. The society is small at present. In 1850 a Sunday-school was organized, Joshua Zartman being the first superintendent. This school is yet continued, with a membership of twenty or more. A parsonage was erected in 1874, at a cost of nine hundred dollars. The Salem German church, of Newark, was organized October 4, 1857. The corner-stone of the church building was laid October 9th, of the same year. The church was dedicated March 28, 1858. Rev. W. C. Kiesel was the first pastor. The first elders were David Fisher, John Durkis, August Auer, and Peter Sacks. The number of members at the organization was forty-nine, all males. W. C. Kiesel continued in the pastorate of this church until 1861, and was succeeded by Rev. R. Shide, in the autumn of that year. Mr. Shide was pastor until the spring of 1864. Rev. Phillip Roser was pastor from 1864 to 1866, and was fol lowed by Rev. F. H. W. Bruechert, who was a graduate of the Presbyterian German Theological seminary at Dubuque, Iowa. The present pastor is Johannes Kromer, a native of Wurtemberg, Ger many. The Sabbath-school has been in existence since the organization of the church. This church b; longs to the Zanesville presbytery, and is there fore a member of the Presbyterian church of North America. The Christian Union church located in Cherry valley, was organized in 1864 by Rev. B. Green. There is a large settlement of people of this denomination in this valley, and the church was well attended and sustained from the start. The original members were James M. Tomkins, John Showman, Jacob Showman, Monterville Lucas, A. Lucas, James Elliott, M. N. Odel, and fifty-five others. In the same year the church was built at a cost of one thousand five hundred dollars. The pres ent membership is about twenty-five. A Sunday school was organized in 1866, Mr. M. N. Odel being the first superintendent. The school numbers, at present, forty scholars and six teachers. C. C. Shaw superintendent. The Seventh Day Advent church is located on Sixth street, between West Main and church streets. It was organized May 14, 1878, at the residence of Joseph Walton, M. D., on North Fifth street, by Elder J. H. Waggoner. The original members were Joseph Walton, Basil B. Francis, Mary Francis, Lucinda Sayre, Harriet Harrison, Samuel W. Brooke, Maria W. Brooke, Julia A. White, Charles C. Chrisman, Hannah F. Francis, Minnie A. Lumley, Charles C. Cooper, Mary Cooper, Melissa J. Dowell, Rachel A. Fow ler, Phyla R. Hutchins, and Mary Lawrence. The church had its origin in a two weeks' camp meeting, held in August, 1877, in the county fair grounds. The attendance at this meeting was large. August 31st a tent was pitched on Fifth, near Granville street, and meetings held there until September 23d, when Wilson's hall was rented for their purposes. Meetings were held during the winter of 1877-8, in the various churches and in Dr. Walton's house. The church was erected in the fall of 1878, and dedicated December 29th, of that year, by Elders D. M. Canright and Burrell. The building is a square frame, and cost one thou sand five hundred dollars. They have no settled pastors. The membership is now twenty-eight. The Sabbath-school was organized January 15, 1S78, and has a membership of thirty-five. The New Jerusalem church is located on Church street. It was organized in 1849 by Rev. Sabin Hough. Most of the original members of the or-"], [586, "576 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. The Rev. E. I. Jones had been preaching to the congregation for seven months before the organiz ing council was called, first in the opera house, afterward in the Murphy home, then in the city hall. The services attending the organization were held in the city hall; the Rev. R. G. Hutchens, D. D., preaching the sermon, and Rev. D. S. Jones expressing the fellowship of the churches. Imme diately after the organization of the church, the members extended an unanimous call to Rev. E. I. Jones to become their pastor. At ten o'clock the next morning, May 22d, the council met to examine the pastor-elect on doctrine and experience, and decided to proceed with the installation, which took place in the presence of a very large congregation on the evening of the same day: Installation sermon by the Rev. Frank Russell, installation prayer by the moderator, charge to the pastor by the Rev. T. H. Hawks, D. D., right hand of fellowship by the Rev. Henry C. Haskell, charge to the people by the Rev. R. G.

On the first Sabbath in June, the church en joyed its first communion, when seven were added to its membership on profession of their faith in Christ. The original members of this organization were: Mrs. Louisa Adams, Charles Adams, William H. Ayres, Mrs. Eliza A. Ayres, Mrs. Martha Ayres, Mrs. R. Biddings, Mrs. Julia Bourne, George M. E.

J. P. Stuart, with twenty members, as follows: James White, Dr. E. R. Tuller, Jane P. Tuller, Henry Jones, William M. Cunningham, William B. Arven, Mary C. Baldwin, Fannie A. Baldwin, R. E. Jones, Ellen Marvin, Jennie Rees, John Cunningham, Henri etta M. Roney, John O. Jones, Elizabeth Bryant, Julia A. Funk, Caroline Jones, William M. Bald win, Julia C. Baldwin, and Valeria Arven. The first lectures on the new church doctrines were delivered in the court house, by Professor Bronson, of Mt. Vernon, Ohio; the early meetings of the organized society being held in the second story of the market-house, corner of Main and Fourth streets. Dr. E. R. Tuller was the leader of worship. The present church edifice was erected in 1861, and cost, with the lot, eleven hundred and sixty five dollars and ninety-three cents. But two set tled pastors have been employed; the first being Rev. A. J. Bartels, from 1862 to 1863, one year, and the second Rev. S. H. Spencer, one year, from 1874 to 1875. Worship has been conducted at other times by leaders selected by the society and by visiting ministers. The membership reached forty-three at one time, but by removals and death it has been much decreased. Plymouth Congregational church, of Newark, was organized May 21, 1879, with sixty-six mem bers, thirty-one by letter and thirty-five on profes sion. The organizing council, of which Rev. Samuel Wolcott, D. D., was moderator, and Rev. Henry C. Haskell, scribe, was composed of representa tives of the following churches, viz: Euclid Ave nue church, of Cleveland; Plymouth church, of Cleveland; the Congregational church of North Amherst; First Congregational church, of Colum bus; Fligh Street Congregational church, of Colum bus; the Congregational church, of North Colum bus; the Congregational church of Alexandria; the Congregational church of Lock; the Congre gational church of Mansfield; the Congregational church of Mt.

THE Mound Builders once occupied the terri- tory which now forms Newton township. They erected some works, the chief of which is a small stone mound between the North fork and the Clear fork, on the farm formerly owned by Mr. John Reed; also a large earth mound on the farm of the late Benjamin Elliott, not far from the junction of the Brushy fork and North fork; and a small stone mound on the hill west of the Coffman mill. There is no Indian history of especial interest connected with the township. The Wyandots, Delawares and Shawnees roamed through it exten sively, using it as a hunting ground, and most like ly had temporary encampments within it, but none of a permanent character, nor any village within historic times, at least. The Clear fork, Brushy fork and North fork are the principal streams. The \"Big spring,\" east of the North fork, forms a tributary to the latter, sometimes called \"Spencer's run,\" and is a consid erable stream. The spring is upon the farm on which General John Spencer settled in 1S05, and in early times furnished an amount of water sufficient to drive a saw-mill and a grist-mill. It was probably the largest spring in Licking county, but, doubtless, in common with other streams, flows less water now than it did at the time of the first settlement of the county, before the land was cleared, and the ob structions in the streams removed, and when the evaporation was inconsiderable. Spencer's run is not much over a mile in length. There is considerable alluvial soil along these streams, but elsewhere in the township the land is rolling, and in some places hilly. It is, however, rather productive, especially in the North fork and Clear fork valleys; also along the Brushy fork and in other localities. Maple, hickory, walnut, sugar and different vari eties of oak were among the prevailing forest trees, with others common in this latitude. Its earlv settlers were mostly from Virginia and western Pennsylvania. John Evans came from Virginia and settled in what afterward became Newton township, in 1803, and was its first settler. His brother, George Washington Evans, either came at the same time or not long afterward, and had a temporary residence with, or near, his brother, before he settled near the Indian village of Raccoon town, now Monroe township, in 1807, and became the first settler in that township. In 1S04, Evan or \"Dickey\" Humphrey, as he"], [588, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 578 was called, and Chiswold May, his son-in-law, both Virginians, settled on Spencer's run. The latter was a noted hunter. Mr. Humphrey was a some what singular, indeed an eccentric character, and had passed with honor through the Revolutionary war. He was one of General Wayne's forlorn hope at the storming of Stoney Point. General John Spencer came from Huntingdon county, Pennsylvania, in the spring of 1805, and settled near the Big spring. Stephen Robinson came during this or the succeeding year. Abraham Wright, James Evans, Evan Pugh and George Harris settled in Newton in 1806. In 1807, Thomas Cannon, of Delaware, came to the township from Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, where he had had a short residence. Abraham Wright, above mentioned as an immi grant of 1806, may not have arrived until this year. William Morrison came from Pennsylvania and settled in this township, on or near the borders of the Welsh hills, during this or the previous year. The immigrants of 1808 were James Stewart, Samuel Stewart, Thomas and William Gray and Nathan and Samuel Preston, though the Preston brothers may have arrived a year later. They all came from Pennsylvania, as did also Captain James Coulter, who settled in 1809 or 1810. Captain Elias Hughes, George Woods and Joseph Laird, became settlers in 1809 or 1810. Henry Benner, John Bevard, and perhaps oth ers came to Newton in 18 10; and these were fol lowed in succession by Major John Huston, Will iam Spencer (brother of General John), Colonel John Waggoner, Peter Pence, David Marple and others, who were principally Virginians and Penn sylvanians. Zachariah Albaugh, the veteran cen tenarian revolutionary hero ; John Keim, Christian Stout, Bazaleel Moreland, Edward Thomas and others were settlers of a later date. These were also VirgNians and Pennsylvanians. James Maxwell taught the first school in the township. This was in a small log cabin school house which stood on the land now owned by Mr. Bullock, near St. Louisville. William Morrison, father of a late fellow citizen, William P. Morri son, was also a pioneer school teacher in Newton. He taught in 1808, in a log structure erected for a stable, on the farm long owned and recently oc cupied by the late venerable Maurice Jones. Mr. Morrison was a man of considerable ability and learning. He received his education in Massa chusetts, his native State, where he attended an academy, having John Quincy Adams, once President of the United States, as a fellow student. Alexander Blackburn taught school in a log school-house that stood on the land now owned by James Stewart, one of .our county commission ers, then near General Spencer's residence, about the year 1810, and for several years afterward. About the same time the aforesaid Maxwell taught in a log school-house wr.ich stood on the farm of Isaac Harris, near the Clear fork. The house was built by George Harris, Stephen Robinson, and a few others in that neighborhood. About the year 1815, Archibald Wilson com menced teaching in Spencer's school-house. He followed teaching several years; having a collegi ate education and considerable ability. He served during the War of 181 2, on the staff of General Gaines, on the northern frontier, in which service his health was greatly impaired. Newton township is, at present, divided into eight districts for school purposes. About the year 1806, Mr. John Henthorn built a grist-mill on Spencer's run. It was a mere corn cracker, about twelve feet square, with buhrs or millstones about the size of a large grindstone. Mr. Stephen Robinson erected a saw-mill on the North fork in 1808, and not long after a grist-mill also, on the same stream. Judge Elliott built a saw-mill on Spencer's run in 1814. William Spencer came to Newton in 1816, and during the next year erected a grist-mill near the Elliott saw-mill on the same stream. During the War of 181 2 George Harris built a saw-mill on the Clear fork; and soon thereafter David Harris erected a grist-mill on the same stream. John Keim built a saw-mill near the mouth of Clear fork about forty years ago. The pioneer preachers of this township were John Emmett, Michael Ellis, William Knox, James Smith, Abraham Fry, John Green, and Messrs. Cloud, Daniels, Gruver, and McClelland. These held religious meetings here before 1810. Rev. James B. Finley regularly traveled a circuit"], [589, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 579 which embraced Newton township, in the years 1810 and 181 1. He preached regularly at the house of Mr. Stephen Robinson while on this cir cuit, and, probably, at the house of Mr. Nathan Preston, who was an acquaintance and friend of his, they having previously lived near each other in the southern part of the State. Mr. Finley was a prominent preacher in Ohio nearly half a century. His father had given him a good education, which, added to more than the usual amount of intellectual power, made him a preacher of considerable force. His father had charge of the Presbyterian church at Cane Ridge, Bourbon county, Kentucky, where was held the celebrated camp-meeting in August, 1801. At this most remarkable camp-meeting or iginated the religious exercises known as the \"jerks.\" Mr. Finley was, in his youth, much given to the vices prevalent in frontier communi ties, but he attended the Cane Ridge camp meet ing, and was induced by the teachings there im parted to him, and by the inspirations he then received, to commence a Christian career which gave to the people of the west the ministerial ser vices of an efficient pioneer preacher for more than fifty years. He was a plain, blunt, bluff, out spoken man, and wielded considerable influence in his denomination. He spent some years as a mis sionary among the Wyandots, and for a long time served as chaplain in the Ohio penitentiary. He was widely known as a bold advocate of temper ance. He indulged much in a pugnacious spirit; x in fact, his temperament was of the combative sort, and he devoted much of his time to fighting schis matics, errorists, distillers, Calvinsts, slave-holders, whiskey-sellers, and sinners generally, of all classes. Mr. Finley was born in North Carolina in 1781, but his childhood and youth were spent in the cane brakes and frontier settlements of Kentucky. He grew into manhood in the midst of rough back woodsmen and untutored, pugilistic associates. After spending many years among the half-civilized Wyandots and State prison convicts, it is not sur prising that he never attained to those superior de grees of polish in manners, speech, and deportment, that belong to the higher plane of civilization; but continued somewhat pugnacious in temper, rustic in manner, and harsh, blunt, rough-spoken in ad dress. Rev. E. Bowman was Mr. Finley's successor on the circuit. He was a man of considerable ability and power in the pulpit. During his term of ser vice (i8.ii and 1812) he adopted the Arian senti ments and propagated them with some success. A number of the local preachers, and many ot the members on his circuit, abjured Methodism and adopted Arianism or Socianism, which culminated in a number of Christian, often called New Light, churches on this old Methodist circuit. A society of Christians was organized in the Clear Fork valley, who subsequently erected a house of worship at the junction of the Utica and Johnstown roads, now Chatham. This church was occupied many years, but was finally superceded by the erection of one west of it, in McKean town ship, and by another in St. Louisville, to which the members of the former transferred their member ship. The controversy started by Rev. Mr. Bowman raged a dozen or twenty years. Much acrimony of feeling, through this and other portions of central Ohio, was manifested by both parties to the con troversy. Armenianism was the party in occupancy and possession, and Socianism contested with zeal, energy, and ability, for the supremacy. Religious disputations were the order of the day, which naturally engendered much partizanship, and, sometimes, harsh and uncharitable feeling. Some law-suits and rending of churches followed, accom panied by a harsh spirit of proselytism indulged in, probably, to an equal extent by both sides. \"Halcyon\" preachers, so called because they propagated a gospel of peace, came along occa sionally in early times. The earliest of these ministrations was held in 18 10, at the house of a Mr. Henthorn, who lived on the North fork above the Robinson mills. Mrs. Donavan was present at this meeting, and has furnished an account of it. She says that a pet pig belonging to the family, which harbored among the bushes or green boughs that adorned the chimney hearth on this occasion (it being summer time) caused some interruption to the flow of halcyon eloquence, during the prog ress of the sermon, by sometimes coming out of his nest, making raids into the audience, and ex citing their risibilities by his antic gambols, to the great disgust of the preacher."], [590, "58o HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. Rev. Abner Goff was an early-time Methodist preacher of Newton township, whose home was on the North fork, near St. Louisville, many years, but he belonged to a more recent period, by a few years, than the foregoing. Rev. Peter Schmucker, a Lutheran minister, and father of the Hon. Isaac Smucker, yet living in Newark, was among the later pioneer preachers of Newton township. He often held religious ser vices, preaching generally in English, but some times in the German language, at the school-house near the residence of General John Spencer, who with Mr. John Keim and their families, with oth ers in the neighborhood, gave those labors their countenance and encouragement. He also, in co-operation with the aforenamed gentlemen, or ganized a Sabbath-school in 1826, probably the first established in the township, or in that section of the county. Funds were raised with which a Sabbath-school library was purchased, and a good degree of success attended the school a number of years. These were the incipient steps in the work of the permanent establishment of Luther anism in Newton township. At present there are five churches in the town ship. Two of these are Methodist, two Lutheran, and one Christian or New Light. One of the Methodist churches was organized at the house of Stephen Robinson in 1810, by Rev. James B. Fin ley. Stephen Robinson and wife, Joseph Lair and wife, Jesse Harris and wife, Samuel Paine and wife, John Paine and Catharine Lair were the original members. This society has a membership of nearly one hundred, and has its church in Chatham. Connected with this society is a Sab bath-school of one hundred pupils. A Baptist church was organized in the township in an early day, and Rev. John Fry was one of its early-time preachers. The society was never very large. They erected their first church edifice in St. Louisville in the earliest years of that village, and in 1849 sold it to the Christian or New Light society. Soon after, they erected a small log church on Lost run, about three miles east of St. Louisville, just over the line in Washington town ship, which is now occupied. Rev. John Pritchard has been nearly thirty years pastor of this church. The Christian church was the second one organ- ized in the township. It was first established on the Clear fork, and its original building erected there; but the society was afterward trans ferred to Sylvania, St. Louisville, and Mt. Hermon in McKean township. Rev. John Lee for many years occupied the pulpit of this church. The society in St. Louisville is not numerous. The oldest of the two Lutheran organizations has a good church building in St. Louisville, with a membership of over one hundred. It was or ganized about the year 1839. Revs. Andrew Henkle and Peter Schmucker were the pioneer preachers within the bounds of this congregation. The Messrs. John, William and Simon Haas and John Koontz were among the original members of this efficient organization. Its ministers were Rev. Solomon Ritz, who organized it, followed by Revs. Bishop, Joseph Wolf, Moyer, Barnes, Shaf fer, William Gilbreath, J. L. Gilbreath, J. J. Mil ler, P. N. O'Banon, George Sinsebaugh, W. G. Kile, T. S. Smedley and others. Their church edifice is the best in the township, A flourishing Sabbath-school is connected with this church, which' averages about one hundred pupils. The Second Methodist church, or Newton chapel, was organized in Mary Ann township, at the house of Mr. Seth Carver, in 1834, by Rev. George Han newalt. Services were subsequently held in Chil coat's school-house in this township, and then in Lock's school-house. The chapel was erected dur ing the summer of 1856, and dedicated in the spring of 1867, the land on which it stands being donated to the society by James Thrapp, who, with J. E. Thrapp and Jeremiah Stout, constituted the building committee. The original members of this church were Seth Carver and wife, James Thrapp and wife, Isaac Harris and wife, David Moats and wife, Edward Thomas and wife, Mrs. Trippier, Joseph Evans, and perhaps a few others. The pastors have been Revs. Cunningham, Mark, Harvey, Ryland, Taylor, Lon nes, Fink, Gardner, Fleming, Ferris, Reed and others. The society is self-supporting, having a membership of fifty or more. The Sunday-school was organized about 1840, the present member ship being about fifty. The second Lutheran society has a good church in Vanattaburgh. Though comparatively modern"], [591, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 5\u00a7 i it was, in the earlier period of its existence flour ishing, efficient and influential for good in the com munity. The first camp meeting held in Newton township was in 1810, or possibly a year later. It was held on the land of Stephen Robinson, now owned by Rev. John Lee. The place was long called Camp Hollow. The second camp meeting was held in 1815, on the Clear fork, on or near the site of the village of Chatham, and was conducted by Rev. John McMahon. Newton township was organized in 1809. Judge Elliott, father of the late Benjamin Elliott, laid out its first village in 1805, calling it Fairfield. It was situated on the south bank of Brushy fork, about three miles north of Newark, on the Mt. Vernon road. It ultimately came to be called Canno'ns burgh, in honor of Thomas Cannon, the tavern keeper of the village. It never grew, and its lots were, after a time, vacated. Judge Elliott is more fully noticed in the chapter on the \"First White Men.\" Chatham, called at first Harrisburgh, was laid out by Colonel John Waggoner in 1829. It has been a post town nearly fifty years. Its inhabitants in 1850 numbered two hundred and eight. At the census of 1870 they had declined to one hun dred and fifty-two, and in 1880 to one hundred and thirty-three. Should this decrease continue it is only a question of time with the existence of the place. It did not long retain the name of Harris- burgh. St. Louisville was laid out in 1839 by John Bell and Stephen Ritter. Subsequently additions were laid out by John Evans and Wesley Coffman. It early became a post town, superceding the post office at Newton Mills, half a mile below. Some of its postmasters were: Elijah Goff, David Carver, Daniel Albaugh, Jackson Belt and Perry A. Harris. The population of the village in 1850 was one hun- dred and nine; in 1870, one hundred and sixty-six; in 1880, two hundred and fifteen. Vanattaburgh is a manufacturig point which has been gradually growing into a village of arti- zans, who, with their families, number a hundred or more. It has a foundry and some factories; also a grocery store, post office and church. It has had its principal growth since the completion of the 27 Sandusky, Mansfield & Newark railroad. The first post office established in the township was at Newton Mills, seven miles north of Newark, at the crossing of the North fork by the Mount Vernon road. Colonel John Waggonor was the first post master, and was succeeded by Major John Huston. Ultimately the office was removed to St. Louisville, and Nathan Hadley appointed postmaster. The Chatham office was the second one established in the township. This was about 1831. Messrs. Gosnell and Myers were the early postmasters. The Vanattaburgh office was the third and last one established. Messrs. Vanatta (from whom the town received its name), Boggs and S. R. Wilson have been postmasters. Mr. Samuel Stewart, county commissioner in 1814-15, was Newton township's first county offi cer. General John Spencer was representative in the legislature of the State from 1814 to 1817, and State senator from 1818 to 1822, inclusive. Colo nel William Spencer was elected county assessor in 1827 for two years, and to the office of sheriff in 1830, and again in 1832. John Bell was elected to the legislature in 1852. Captain James Coulter held the office of coroner a number of years. John Stewart was elected county treasurer in 1839 for two years. James Stewart was county commis sioner several years. The population of the township in 1840 was one thousand two hundred and forty-seven ; in 1850, one thousand three hundred and sixty-four; in 1860, one thousand three hundred and ten, in 1870, one thousand three hundred and three, and in 1880, one thousand three hundred and thirty two. A few of the incidents of pioneer times in New- ton are worth preservation. Rev. James B. Finley remarks, in his \"autobiog- raphy : \" ' ' That one evening, on one of his tours down the North fork of Licking, in the winter of 1810-11, he heard not far off the report of a gun, followed by screams, apparently from some person who had been shot. It was about twilight, and he pro- ceeded to the house, near by, of Mr. Stephen Robinson, where soon a messenger arrived, who announced that a man had been shot at the creek. \"Mr. Finley, with others, at once went to the relief of the victim, whose tracks they were able to follow by the blood, which had spurted from the gun-shot wound, at every jump, as from a stricken deer."], [592, "582 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. ' ' They soon found him in a cabin with a family, where, prob ably he had his home, he being a single man. Mr. Finley assisted in binding up the wound, and the party then returned to Mr. Robinson's.\" The foregoing paragraph'from^Mr. Finley's note book refers to an attempt made about seventy years ago, to kill a Mr. William Kinning, who had recently become a settler in this township, and was boarding with a family whose residence was on the west of the North fork, near to or on the farm of Stephen Robinson. Kinning received the shot while crossing the creek on a log. Tracks in the snow and other circumstances pointed to a man as the assassin who lived on the east side of the North fork. The suspected culprit fled, but was pursued, captured and put into what was a very poor apology for a jail, in Newark. This attempt at murder intensely excited the entire community. Hon. William Stanbery was engaged as \u2022 counsel to de fend him, but before the day of trial came he es caped from jail, and has not since been heard from. Kinning finally recovered. He was an eccentric Scotchman who generally kept a good horse, and traveled extensively, absenting himself sometimes for months, his whereabouts being, at such times, unknown here. His wound in the hip left him somewhat lame, and he was charged with itinerat ing as a mendicant, in the assumed character of a crippled soldier of the War of 1812. Be that as it may he somehow became possessed of a considerable sum of money, principally in bills is sued by the Granville Alexandrian society. One day, when on one of his mysterious tours, he heard of the failure of this library and banking company, and at once started for the office of the association for the purpose of securing his money. The doors were closed, and after several calls, failing to ob tain admittance, and becoming, in the meantime, pretty well filled with whiskey, a beverage few Scotchmen reject, he secured a maul, and at tempted the enforced resumption of specie pay ments by battering down the door. A crowd soon gathered, compelling him to desist, and fearing ar rest, he mounted his horse, and rode rapidly to Newark. He called at Colonel Gault's for another drink, then started on double quick time, and had just passed out the east of the square as the Granville officer and his posse entered at the northwest corner. This was Kinning's last visit to this section of the country. It was about 1817, and he was never heard of afterward. In 1805 Richard Humphrey and his son-in-law, Chisholm Mav, lived on Spencer run, near where the Henthorn mill was erected. General Spencer lived near the head of the run not far from the spring. One daj', during the summer, while the general was at work in his corn-field, and Mrs. Sp;ncer was away from their cabin, a huge bear came along and seized a pig of good size near where a little four year-old, their son, and a sister older, were playing. The squealing of the pig arrested their attention, and\" they had barely time to get inside of the cabin before the bear came along with the pig, passing near the cabin door. The sister, being older and stronger, helped the boy up into the cabin loft. Bruin ran down near the cabin of Mr. May. The latter seeing him, and being a hunter, took his gun and dogs, pursued, overtook and killed him. It is owing mainly to the fact that this bear selected the pig in the yard, and not the boy, that Newton township was, until 1874, indebted for the continued presence of Col. William Spencer, whose residence there dates further back than that of any man who was living in the township at the date of his death. General John Spencer, Elias Hughes, and the centenarian hero of Revolutionary fame, Zachariah Albaugh, may appropriately be named as among the most noteworthy and patriotic of the settlers of the township. The latter was born in the Shen andoah valley, Virginia, and was removed by his father in early life to Maryland, where he resided at the beginning of the Revolutionary war, being then eighteen years of age. At this age he entered the army as a private, but subsequently became an officer, and served during the entire war. He participated in the sanguinary battle of German town, October 31, 1777. At the close of the war he removed to West moreland county, Pennsylvania, where he lived, near the residence of General St. Clair, until 1817, when he emigrated to Licking county. Here he lived (with the exception of a short time spent in"], [593, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 583 Knox county) in comparative retirement during the last forty years of his life; finally closing his eventful career on the ninth day of November, 1857, at the advanced age of one hundred years or more. His death occurred at the residence of his son in Newton township, where he was buried with the honors of war. He was long a pensioner of the Government whose freedom he assisted in establishing. He had outlived his age and generation, and conse- quently, during many of the latter years of his life, his intercourse with mankind yvas limited; but he retained until within a short period before his death, his mental faculties to a remarkable degree. Mr. Albaugh was of German descent, and his education had been mainly in the German lan- guage, though not exclusively. During a consid- erable portion of his life he was engaged in teach- ing, both in German and English. His reading had been more extensive than was usual with his cotemporanes, and he was consequently more in- telligent, and possessed of a wider range of infor- mation than was common during the last century among men in the humble walks of life. In religion he was a Lutheran; and attributed his long life mainlv to his almost total abstinence from intoxicating liquors, his general conformity to the laws ot health ; and it was probably owing, in a great measure also, to his cheerful disposition, hilarious temperament, and his disposition to look on the \"sunny side of things.\" Wise, indeed, is he who can live such a life, but rarely is such a life to be found. Captain Hughes was the first settler in the county and an early settler in this township. The leading incidents of his eventful life are presented at length in another chapter of this work. General John Spencer was born in Huntingdon county, Pennsylvania, in 1780, came to Newton township in 1805, and reached the termination of his active, patriotic, and useful life, April 1, 1827, aged forty-seven years. He was a first-class pio- neer, a man of generous impulses, of kindness of heart, ot undoubted courage, of unquestioned patriotism, of great integrity of character, of many excellent qualities which he exhibited in the varied relations of husband, father, citizen, neighbor, friend, soldier, commander, magistrate, and legis- lator. It may be stated in evidence of the high estimation in which he was held by his fellow citi zens, that he occupied civil or military positions nearly the entire period of his residence in Licking county. His soldierly qualities developed in the War of 1812. He entered the service during the first year of the war, was surrendered at Detroit, and thus became a paroled prisoner of war. With some this would have been a sufficient reason to re main at home until exchanged, but in 1813, when the northern frontier was menaced, he recruited a company and went again to the front as captain. During General Harrison's visit to Newark, in 1836, he had a conversation with Amos H. Caffee, esq., in relation to the events of the War of 1812. During this interview the services of General Spencer, as a military officer, came under review. General Harrison observed that soon after Spen cer joined him, he detailed the troops to pursue General Proctor, it being just before the battle of the Thames and omitted Captain Spencer's com pany. Knowing the captain to be a paroled prisoner, he did not wish to put him in jeopardy, but intended to assign to him duty in the rear, where he would not be exposed to capture. Of this Captain Spencer complained to the general, telling him that he did not know what he had done that he was not of the detail. General Har rison replied that he knew him (Spencer) to be a brave man, but that as he was a paroled prisoner, if he was captured, nothing that he could do would save his life. \"And is that all?\" replied Captain Spencer. \"General,\" he continued, \"it is for you to say whether I shall go at the head of my company or as a volunteer in the ranks, for I am going with you.\" Captain Spencer and his company were included in the detail. General Harrison observed, however, that if the tide of battle had turned against him, he would have made special effort to protect Captain Spencer's company and its brave commander from capture. He had several narrow escapes during the war, his clothes being penetrated by the enemy's balls a number of times. His scabbard was struck by a bullet, in the battle of Brownstown, which broke the blade into a number of pieces, the flattened ball lodging in the bottom of the scabbard."], [594, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 584 When the swollen, turbid waters of the North fork closed over General Spencer, the career of a liberal-minded, independent man was arrested; the impulses of a generous nature were extinguished and a heroic life went out. Under the inspirations of the teachings of Gen eral Spencer, Captain Hughes and others, the early settlers were very patriotic. The township furnished the two captains, above mentioned for the War of 1812, and kept up a company of volunteers as long as any other portion of the county, after the war was ended. It was com manded respectively by John Spencer, David Har ris, William Spencer, Hite, Hannah, Belt, Farmer, and others. The \"Newton Blues\" had a long and honorable career, going out among the last of the indepen dent volunteer companies that originated during the War of 181 2. Colonel William Spencer, a son of General John Spencer, 'was born in Huntingdon county, Pennsyl vania in 1802, and was brought with the family of his father to \"Big spring \" when three years of age. He entered public life soon after becoming eligible, and held many stations of trust, honor and emolu ment in military and civil life. His first position was that of magistrate. In 1827 he was elected county assessor, and served as such two years, when he became sheriff of the county, serving from 1830 to 1834; in the latter year he was elected county auditor, and served, by re-election, until 1841. For a number of years he served as a member of the board ot public works of the State, and when, in 1851, the office of clerk ofthe court became elective under the constitution, he was elected to this office, serving three years, and retiring in 1855. He was subsequently city clerk, president of the city council, and held other offices. Except a few years spent in the west, he was a life-long citizen of this county, and one of the best known of its public men. He was the cotemporary of Colonel Gault, Colonel Stadden, Major John Stewart, Colonel J. B. W Haynes, Hon. William Stanbery, Major Anthony Pitzer, General Augustine Munson, Amos H. Caffee, William P. Morrison, Lucius Case, Rees Darling ton, Bryant Thornhill, Joshua Mathiot, Judge Searle, Judge Haughey, Colonel James Parker, General Jonathan Taylor, Hon. Daniel Duncan, George H. Flood, Benjamin Briggs, and many other prominent men, and outlived them all. He took an active part in the organization of the Pio neer society and was one of its officers until he could serve no longer, by reason of his continued stay at Columbus, where he was clerk of the lessees ofthe Ohio canals. He died April 27, 1874, aged seventy-two years. CHAPTER LXXI. PERRY TOWNSHIP.

In that year the number of inhabitants had in creased sufficiently to justify a separate organization. It was named in honor of Commodore Perry. To the sagacious and calculating pioneer, this township did not present as great inducements for settlement as most other parts of the county, and was therefore among the last to which immi grants turned their attention. The surface is gen erally rough and hilly, and in some parts very"], [595, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 585 broken. The southern portion embraces mainly a barren, rocky range known as Bald Hills, and con tains very few tracts of land suitable for farming purposes. The middle and northern parts are also hilly, though these are less precipitous and possess a fair share of fertility. The only bottom land in the township is in the immediate vicinity of Elizabethtown, and a few narrow strips along the Wakatomika and its tribu tary, Brushy fork. The latter is the main stream in the township, and, with its tributaries, drains every part of it. This stream rises in the north western corner of the township, flowing generally south or a little east of south, until near the south ern part, where it makes a bend, and taking a gen erally northeast course, leaves the township near its northeastern corner, passing into Muskingum county, where it soon joins the Wakatomika. Small tributaries enter the stream from either side during its entire course. These are mostly, or entirely, made up of the numerous springs among the hills. The Rocky fork crosses the southwestern corner of the township, and a tributary of this stream crosses the northwestern corner; while the main Wakatomika creek passes across a small portion of the northwestern corner. The Bald Hills are seemingly devoid of water-courses. The first settler within the limits of Perry was Samuel Hickerson. In 1810 he erected a cabin and began a clearing near what afterward became the residence of Milton Montgomery, on a small tributary of the Brushy fork. For more than ten months he remained the solitary inhabitant of this wilderness, and pushed his improvements forward with considerable success. In the following year James Thrap and Allen Hall came into this territory, and soon after they were followed by John Frost, Stephen Cooper and others who settled on the Brushy fork. After that settlers came in rapidly. It is impossible to obtain from the township records the names of its first officers or their suc cessors; for until as late as 1866, the records were kept on loose sheets and slips of paper, which were destroyed or lost after immediate use. The first trustees were Allen Hall, Samuel Hick erson and James Somerville; clerk, Jordan Hall. Two villages have an existence in this township, the most important of which is Elizabethtown. It was laid out in 1831, by Mrs. Elizabeth Lemert, from whom it received its name. The first settlers in the village were Samuel Hickerson and Daniel Helenus. It contains at present something more than one hundred inhabitants, and the business consists of two stores, kept by Anson P. Winter mute and J. S. Seward; a wagon shop by Thomas Holman; two blacksmith shops; a saw-mill, card ing-mill and planing-mill, the three last owned by Messrs. Thomas and Lugenbeel. A post office was established there at an early day called \"Per ryton,\" and probably Mr. Green was the first post master. He was succeeded by Mr. Hugh Flem ming, who has retained the office ever since. Denman's cross-roads was surveyed into lots and regularly laid out, but has not prospered, and contains half a dozen families, more or less. The business is comprised in a store, kept by Mr. L. V. Hoyt, a blacksmith shop and a shoe shop. In this township, as in perhaps a great portion of the Northwest territory, that preeminently mis sionary society, the Methodist, was the first to carry the consolations of religion to the destitute pioneers. The first sermon preached within the limits of this territory was by the well known pioneer preach er, Rev. Joseph Thrap, in 181 1. From that time to the present this denomination has been the lead ing one in the township. The first travelling minister to preach in Perry was Rev. Michael Ellis, who formed a class at the house of James Thrap in 18 13. The society has grown and prospered since that time and is now large and powerful. This society has a fine church edifice at Elizabethtown. The above account of early Methodism in Perry township is taken from the historical sketch of this township by C. B. Woodward ; it differs somewhat from the following, from the pen of S. M. Wells, of Delaware, Ohio. He says: \"In the year 1813, Phillip Denman built a hewed-log house, the first in that part of Perry township in which he lived. The building was eighteen by twenty-eight, and, at the time, the largest dwelling in the township. \"John Livingston, a near neighbor and a land-holder,.sug gested that a preaching place in their neighborhood would be an inducement for respectable people to come in and settle"], [596, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 586 and would enhance the value of their land, and said: 'Den man, you must throw open your new house for that purpose.' \"Denman consented if Livingston would find the preacher, and a few davs after the latter met, as he was going to Newark, what was unmistakably a Methodist preacher, known in those days by their peculiar dress, and stopping him related that they had decided to have religious services in their neighborhood, and had a house suitable for that purpose, and asked him to make an appointment. This the minister agreed to do on his return from a visit to his parents in Virginia, whither he was then going, and told him to give out an appointment four weeks from the following Sunday. \u25a01 Livingston neglected to ascertain his name, but on his re turn home spread far and wide the word that there would be preaching in Phillip Denman's new house on such a date by the 'third angel.' The oddity of such an announcement brought together a crowd, many through curiosity to see who would represent the 'third angel.' \"The preacher, who was John Cobler, the first minister sent by a Methodist conference west of the Ohio river, was on hand promptly, and satisfied his congregation, and on his return to conference reported Denman's as a preaching place, and it con tinued to be a week day appointment every two weeks unti. 1828. This was the beginning of Methodism in Perry town_ ship.\" The writer of the above extract is probably mis taken about this being the \"beginning of Method ism in Perry,\" as Rev. Joseph Thrap moved into the adjoining township, Hanover, as early as 1805, and as he preached frequently in different parts of the county, it is reasonable to assert that he did so within the limits of Perry before 1813. At present there is but one Methodist church in the township, this being the Episcopal Methodist at Elizabethtown. Regular services are held and an active Sunday-school maintained. The Disciples were late in introducing their pe. culiar form of faith, yet they have a strong hold in Perry. The first preaching was in 1829 or 1830, by James Porter and John Secrest, in the bouse of Mrs. Elizabeth Lemert, and through the Zealand indomitable energy of this excellent woman the first church edifice was erected on her premises in Elizabethtown, about 1831. It was constructed of hewed logs; and in this a society was organized about 1833. John Dodson was appointed elder and sustained that relation to this church for six teen years, until he removed to Brushy fork. Since that time Abner Lemert, Beverly Lemert, Hezekiah Shacklet, William Brown and William Phillips have been elders. The first organization of this church consisted of the following members: Mrs, Elizabeth Lem- ert, Joseph Leatherman and wife, Minerva and Abner Lemert, Leroy Lemert and wife, William Adams, wife and two daughters, Archibald and David Mercer, Rachel Reed, Moses and Jacob Priest, and Daniel Lauthlin and wife. - In 1846 or 1847, a frame church edifice was erected, much better than the hewed log, but not in an eligible situation, nor in such a manner as to be conducive to health or comfort. It, however, an swered the purpose until 1869, when a very credit able building was erected in a suitable place. It was dedicated the third Sabbath in June of that year, the sermon being delivered by J. H. Jones. The church is strong and active at present, the mem bership being about eighty. It also maintains a fine Sabbath-school. The Baptist church was constituted in 1847 by that zealous and efficient missionary preacher, John Fry, who was the first to introduce the doctrines of this church into this territory. He was assisted by John Crabtree and Joseph Sperry, and the first organization consisted of seven persons \u2014 three males and four females. The first deacon was James Holmes, and the first clerk, Ezra Sperry. In 1864, John Bilby and William Clagett were installed deacons, and James Holmes clerk. John Fry remained pastor until 1853, and was followed by Stephen C. Smith, John Pritchard, Johnson VanHorn, William But ler, and John Pritchard, the present pastor. Their church building at Pleasant Hill is a respectable one, and the society is in a flourishing condition, the present membership being about fifty. The Protestant Methodists early formed a soci ety in Perry, and for many years prospered, but the building in which they worshipped at Eliza bethtown being weakly built, soon fell into ruins, and they have not been able to erect another ; consequently the society is not at present in exist ence. Education received early attention, though the sparseness of the population prevented the estab lishment of schools as early as was desirable. In 1822 a school-house was built on the farm now owned by Daniel Wagstaff. It was a rude log structure, and in it Miss Elmira Lewis gathered a few scholars, and began a \"subscription\" school. She was quite popular, and the pioneers were"], [597, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 587 much pleased with the success of their first effort. Unable to secure the services of Miss Lewis for a second term, a Miss Nelson was installed as teacher. In 1827 a second school was started in a house similar to the first, built on the Furnace land. Isaac Schneider and Daniel Beardley were the teachers at that time. Subscription schools were continued until the present system took their place. Perhaps the most noteworthy person in the pio neer history of Perry was Samuel Montgomery, a local Methodist preacher. He came early into the township from Virginia, and during his long stay no man was more respected or influential than he. A blameless life, an earnest zeal for re ligion and the preservation of public morals, com mended him more to the good opinion of the peo ple than any display of oratory. His preaching was always listened to by many and app, eciative hearers. On funeral occasions \"Uncle Sammy', generally officiated, and at marriages he was sel dom absent. John Livingston was among the first pioneers, and was a noted hunter. The greater part of his time was spent in the pursuit of wild game. His success exceeded that of all others in the community; and many tales are yet told of his wonderful exploits. Once, while returning from a hunting excursion, fatigued by excessive exertion, and walking slowly through the woods, a panther that had probably been crouching upon the limb of a tree waiting for a victim, suddenly sprang upon his back, tearing off two hunting shirts, and raking his back with its terrible claws, on its way to the ground. The hunter turned instantly and fired without aim, but the attack had been so sud den and unexpected that he was greatly excited and missed. He now realized that he stood face to face with one of the most formidable and fero cious beasts of the forests, with an empty gun in his hand and no other weapon of defence. The panther was crouching for a spring, and remem bering that wild beasts are \"sometimes held at bay when their eyes are caught bv that of a human be ing, Livingston looked steadily at the beast and began reloading his gun. Keeping his eye fixed upon that of the panther, he emptied the contents of his powder-horn into the gun, without thinking of what he was doing, and dropped in a bullet, without the usual patching and ramming. It was quickly done, and placing the muzzle within a foot of the panther's head, he fired. The result was a bursted gun, a lacerated hand and a pan ther's head blown to atoms. He now felt the effects of the scratches on his back, the loss of blood and the relaxation from terrible excitement, and it was with difficulty that he dragged himself to a neighboring cabin, where he was cared for. It was a long time before he recovered from the ef fects of this encounter. Mr. Livingston had many encounters with wild beasts of this vicinity, during his long life as a hunter, but this was probably the most terrible, and the one in which he came the nearest to losing his life. The Denmans, as before stated, were among the earliest pioneers, and were also largely engaged in hunting. Several descendants are yet living in the vicinity of Denman's cross roads. A bear story in connection with this family is worth pre serving. One morning the wife of Hathaway Denman, while attending to her household duties, Mr. Den man being absent at work in the woods, was startled by the cries of her two-year old son, who had been playing near the cabin under the watch ful care of the large house dog. Simultaneously with the screaming of the child came the fierce barking of the dog; it was that peculiar savage bark that dogs always give when close upon the enemy. Mrs. Denman rushed out of the cabin, and was horrified to find her little boy running to ward her, while a black bear, which had been closely pursued by the dog, was just mounting upon the \"bench\" of the chimney, four or five feet from the ground. Here the bear was held at bay by the dog, while Mrs. Denman, seizing the child, ran toward the spot where her husband was at work. The faithful dog kept bruin perched upon the chimney until Mr. Denman came and shot him. The pioneers of this township were mostly from Virginia, though many came from New Jersey and Pennsylvania. They are industrious, temper ate and economical. They are moral, religious, and take a deep interest in educational matters."], [598, "CHAPTER LXXII. ST. ALBANS TOWNSHIP.

So far as recorded, there are but four mounds in this township. One is on what is known as the \"Gailor farm,\" now owned by Thomas Jones, near the Kirkersville road, and south of the Gaffeld meeting-house; another on the hill upon which stands the residence of J. Davis, one-half mile east of Alexandria, and north of the road leading to Newark ; and a third further west, upon the farm of John Reed known as the \"Thrall farm,\" but the largest is probably the one on the land of E. R. Cornell, about twenty rods south of the Dela ware road. It is said to have been eighteen feet in height within the memory of the older citizens, but from various causes it is now considerably lower. About 1830 Dr. Fassett, Archibald Cornell and Israel Peck excavated to its center, on a level with the original earth, and found human bones of more than one skeleton and some polished stones. In addition to these works of the Mound Build ers, there are two inclosures; one the shape of an egg, inclosing about six acres on the farm of Abner Lyman, known as the Phillips or Follett farm. The Delaware road passes through it, leaving the larger part on the south side, but from years of cultiva tion it is hardly discernible. The second one is on the Thrall farm, lying between the wall mentioned, and the Cornell mound. A third earthwork is located on the farm of D. W. Lewis, in the southern part of the township, about three miles south of Alexandria, and a mile west of the Wesleyan Methodist church. The township lies wholly within the United States military lands, and is well watered by Rac coon fork of Licking river and its tributaries. Rac coon passes through in a southeasterly direction, the following streams emptying into it from the south : Cornell run, the two Pettee runs, and Mootz run. Those coming in from the north are the Drake or Carpenter, and Lobdell runs. Some of these runs furnish sufficient water for milling purposes. There are numerous springs throughout the township. The names of the tributaries of the Raccoon were derived from the early settlers along their banks, with one exception, Mootz run, which is supposed to have taken its name from the name of \"J. Mootz,\" cut at an early day on a beech tree which stood near the Gilbert mills, and east of the stream. The name was found there by the earliest settlers in that locality, and is supposed to have been cut by some one belonging to a surveying party, as the name had the appearance of being cut with irons used by surveyors to mark the trees along the lines run. The soil of the township is among the best for farming purposes. The wide, rich bottom lands along the Raccoon were originally covered with very large trees of every variety of hard wood known to this climate. These have long since dis appeared, and in their place are well cultivated farms. The second bottom land is excellent for wheat, and the upland has, perhaps, no superior for grasses. The first settler upon this territory was John Cooke Herron, who was born in Pennsylvania, and"], [599, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 589 came with his father to Newark. They were among the first families to settle in that place. He married Miss Catharine Ward, whose father lived on the farm now known as a dairy farm, in Harrison town ship. They were married in 1807, and the same year erected their cabin on the farm afterward owned by Noah Morrow, in the southern part of the township. He made the first clearing in the spring of 1808, being assisted in his log-rolling by Deacon Butler of Harrison township. His son, Samuel, born in December of the same year, was the first white child born in the township; and a daughter, Catharine, born in September 181 1, was probably the first female born in the township. After remaining a short time on his farm Herron removed to Newark, but soon returned to his farm, where he remained until his death, which occurred in January, 18 15. The next family to become identified with the history of the township was Cornell. In the win ter of 1807-8, Gideon, Sylvanus and Archibald Cornell, with their sisters, moved temporarily into the township to work at clearing land for a Mr. Waters, who then owned the lands afterward occu pied as farms by J. L. Tyler, N. W. Clafflin, Swain Williams and David Charles; the Cornells to have a certain amount of land for clearing a certain number of acres \u2014 thought to be one hundred for clearing fifty. This Mr. Waters was a pioneer, but being unmarried, in poor health, unable to do manual labor, dying at an early day, and never having made this township his permanent home, his name, in all probability, would never have found its way into this history, but for this contract with the Cornells. The clear ing made by the Cornells was known as the Waters clearing. Mr. Waters died in the village of Gran ville November 5, 1809. Gideon Cornell died in October, 1857, aged seventy-three; Sylvanus died in October, 1865, aged seventy-six; and Archi ald died in August, 1856, aged sixty-three. The next settler was Joshua Lobdell, from Mc- Connellstown, Pennsylvania. He may be said to have been the second settler who came for a per manent settlement. He arrived in the spring of 1808, his father, David Lobdell, accompanying and making his home with him. He settled on the farm afterward known as the Atwood or Fitch farm, subsequently the residence of William Green. The settlement of Mr. Lobdell upon this particular piece of land was accidental. It is stated that \"a weary, footsore traveler, who had been to the west, came along, stopping at their residence in Pennsylvania, and offered to sell his farm west of the Ohio for a horse, saddle and bri dle.\" The family bad been thinking of moving west, and this offer was accepted by Mrs. Lobdell, who, it appears, did the trading, and thus the farm came into their possession. It would appear from the above statement that this \"weary, foot-sore trav eler \" had been in this township, probably, prior to its first settlement. Joshua Lobdell set out the first orchard in the township in 1809; the trees being brought from Muskingum county. He and his father were among the number that organized the Baptist church on the Welsh hills in September, 1808. Joshua was the first elder of the church. The death of David Lobdell, which occurred in 1809, when he was seventy, was the first in the township. He was buried on the Drake farm, nearly one mile west of Alexandria, on the bluff overlooking Raccoon, between the Delaware and Columbus roads. Joshua was the first carpenter in the town ship, and did not long survive his father, dying in 181 2, aged forty-six. His only son, Samuel, lost his life in the war of 18 12. In the spring of 1809 came Thomas Owens, a widower, from the Welsh hills, with a family of nearly grown-up children. He lived on the Wa ters farm, but only remained a short time ; having married a daughter of Thomas Phillips, who lived on the Welsh hills, to which place Mr. Owens moved his family in the winter or early spring o 1811. Samuel Carpenter, sr., from Luzerne county, Pennsylvania, also settled with his family in this township in the spring of 1809. He came in 1805 to Rush creek, Fairfield county, where he re mained until he settled here. The first church was organized and the first ser mod preached in the cabin of Mr. Carpenter, by Mr. Bacon, a minister traveling through the coun try on foot, carrying his saddle-bags on his arm, in 1810 or 181 1. He remained over night with the"], [600, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 590 southeast corner of the township, on the More house King farm. He employed L. Butler, of Harrison township, to build his cabin, which he did for the sum of thirty dollars. This family, also, moved away in a short time. The Witherell family were the last to arrive during this year (1811). They came from Connecticut and settled on the farm afterward owned by L. B. Stark. There were three boys, all young men, Luther, Comfort and Daniel, the mother and three other children. They came from their old home in a wagon entirely of their own make, even to the tire, which was of wood. When the tire wore off they were compelled to stop and re-tire. In this wagon they carried all their household goods, and other earthly possessions, besides the younger members of the family when tired of walking; and this wagon was drawn by hand from Connecticut to the wilds of Ohio. Probably the wagon tire was less trouble than the family tire, and was not so often retired. They soon returned to Connect icut, but came back again to St. Albans, where the mother died, and was the second person buried in the Gaffield burying ground \u2014 Lucy A. McCreary, who died June 8, 1821, being the first interment. The settlers in this township in 181 2 were Peter Stephens and his son Justice, with their families; Isaiah Beaumont, sr., and family, and Elijah Fox and brother. The three first arrived in January, from Luzerne county, Pennsylvania. Stephens and son had visited the township the previous summer and put in crops. They settled on the farm since owned by Joseph Bowman, but moved in a few years to Monroe township, where some of the family yet live. Beaumont settled on the farm that yet bears his name, and remained there until his death, in 1837, at the age of eighty one. He was a great hunter, and looked upon as the Nimrod of the township. The Foxes were bachelors and settled upon land since owned by Thomas Jones, on the Jersey road. They were frontiersmen, and only remained about two years, when they sold out to John Lockwood. The settlers of 1813 were Thomas Spellman and Amos Carpenter, with their families, from Granville, who settled on the Worthington road; and Elijah Adams, Asa Plummer, and William Mills, on the Delaware road. Mr. Spellman settled on the farm Carpenters, and preached this sermon to a small gathering of settlers. Rev. J. B. Finley, however, says, in his history of Methodism, that he preached the first sermon in that township, at the cabin of S. Carpenter, sr., late in 1810 or early in the fol lowing year. If he did so, he failed to make the same impression on the younger members of his congregation as was made by Mr. Bacon. Mr. Carpenter erected the first brick house in the township, in 1821; and died in March, 1834, aged eighty-one. His son, Rev. Samuel Carpen ter, settled on the farm adjoining his father's, and erected a brick residence in 1827, the oldest brick building now standing in the township. He was married to Mercy Cornell, December 21, 1809, by Rev. T. Harris, of Granville; and had they been married in the township, would have been the first; but, though both had been living in the township, and shortly after the marriage made this their home, they were married at the house of the bride's mother in Granville; hence the marriage of Gideon Cornell to Miss Julia Lobdell, July 17, 1810, was' the first marriage ceremony performed in the township. Rev. S. Carpenter died in Au gust, 185 1, aged seventy-eight years. The settlers in 1810 were William Pettee, his son True, and a carpenter by the name of Noble Landon. They came together from Vermont, and settled on the farm afterward owned by George Shaw. Upon the organization of the township in 181 3, Landon was elected its first justice of the peace. Pettee was a cooper, and the first in the township, he was also a local preacher of the Methodist Episcopal church. In the spring of 181 1 Samuel Clark, one of the Granville company, settled on the Worthington road, near the eastern line of the township, where he worked at his trade, being the first blacksmith, and a good mechanic. He remained here until his death, in 1824. During this year David Drake came. He was a brother-in-law of Joshua Lob dell, and from the same neighborhood in Pennsyl vania. He was the first wagon-maker in the town ship, and died in 1867, aged ninety-four years. A Mr. Murdock also erected a cabin on what is known as the Barnes' farm, but he was not long a resident of the township. Mr. West came from Maine and settled in the"], [601, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 59i since owned by S. Smith, and died in his seventy sixth year ; Mr. Carpenter settled on the farm since owned by L. B. Stark, and died in his seventy-first year; Mr. Adams settled on the Cornell farm; Mr. Plummer made the first improvement on Blood Hill, and opened the first house of entertainment in 1813 or 1 8 14, but sold out, shortly, to Willliam Mills, who still continued to keep the house of entertainment until Frederick Blood purchased the farm, and opened the first hotel in 1816 or 1817. The first election was held in the fall of this year (1813) at the house of S. Carpenter, sr,; the first trustees elected were Isaiah Beaumont, Peter S. Stephens and David Drake; the first clerk was Noble Landon, who named the township after his native place, St. Albans, Franklin county, Ver mont. This privilege was accorded him in consid eration of furnishing four gallons of whiskey to the seventeen electors present During the year 18 14. Helon Rose, Chauncey Phelps, William Clemons, John Lockwood, Joel Philbrook, Sewel Wilson, Hiel Williams, and San ford Converse settled in the township; and in 1815 came Jonathan At wood, Knowles Linnel, William Hastings, Isaac Longwell, Aaron Park, Josiah Eastman, David Wright, J. R. Curtis, Ste phen Emerson, John McCreary, Thomas Munsell, Daniel Vail, Japhet Sherman, and Abram Mayfield. The first military company was organized this year with the following officers: Captain, Sanford Con verse: Lieutenant, Archibald Cornell; Ensign, Amos Carpenter. In 1816, the arriving settlers were Alpheus Baker, William Gailor, Harry Clemons, William Munsell, Peter Hird, Thomas Munsell, jr., Daniel Gailor, Jonathan Derby, Benjamin Linnel, and James Scott. Settlers increased rapidly after this year, and space cannot be allowed for following them further. Miss Jerusha Baker taught the first school in the township, in the summer of 181 2, in an old cabin belonging to the Cornells. Levi Phelps was the first male teacher, and taught his first school in the winter of 1813-14, in a cabin belong ing to Benjamin Carpenter which had been some what remodelled for this purpose. The first school house erected in the township was of log, built in November, 1816, and stood north of where the Kirkersville road intersects the Worthington, on land then owned by Thomas Spellman. It was also used for elections and township meetings. The first school in it was in the winter of 1816-17, and was kept by Martin Mazervy. The first Sab bath-school was organized in this building, proba bly, in 18 1 8, in which the people of the commu nity united, without regard to denominational views, and Deacon Oren Barnes was the first superintendent. The first building for church purposes was the old brick school-house on the Worthington road, a mile south of Alexandria. It was erected in 1824, and was sufficiently large for church pur poses. It was a log building with a large fire-place in each end, and was for years a place of meeting whether for political or religious purposes. After Alexandria was laid out, it was no longer used as it formerly had been ; the old building was torn down, and one erected expressly for school pur poses. In it lived the first physician in the town ship, his family occupying half the building, a temporary partition having been been erected. He was both physician and teacher, his name being Kirkham, said to have been the brother of the author of Kirkham's grammar. He remained but a short time. Dr. Henry V. Owen, was the first permanent physician. He came in 1834, intending to remain only over night, but, at the urgent solicitation of the citizens, made this his permanent home. He was from Cayuga county, New York, graduated in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and died in March, 1864. The first grist-mill was Mower's, near the old mill property known as Gilbert's mill. It was started in 1818. The first saw-mill was the Clemon's mill, now owned by L. M. Spellman. It was started the same year. The first distillery was that of Helon Rose, situ atuated south of the present residence of Lyman Carter. It was started about 18 18, but Mr. Carter did not run it long before he sold out to Dr. Enos Nichols. The first frame house was Jonathan Atwood's, built in 1820 or 182 1, and is still standing, being part of the dwelling of William Green."], [602, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 592 The first cabinet shop was built by B. F. Hillier, in 1822, near where stands the residence of William Beaumont. It was almost exclusively of buckeye logs, roofed with boards, and the joints covered with slabs. The first interment in the old graveyard adjoin ing the new cemetery was June 20, 1838. The village of Alexandria having been laid ont, the pro prietor, Alexander Devilblis, in the spring of 1838, gave the lot for burial purposes. David Patterson, originally from Pennsylvania, coming to the town ship from Guernsey county in the spring of 1818, died in April, 1830, and was buried on the Biggs' lot, just west of Alexandria. Mrs. Patterson died in June, 1838, and as the ground was secured and accepted for burial purposes, she requested, before her death, that they remove her husband's remains and bury both in the then new cemetery; and, on the twentieth of June, 1838, they were interred, side by side, in the same grave. The child of Asahel Craw had been buried before this, as they supposed on the ground given for burial purposes, but when run out it was beyond the boundary, and, upon the death of another child soon after, it was removed, and both buried in one grave. Probably the warmest and most exciting election ever held in the township was the one for a justice in the year 18 16, when S. Carpenter, sr., was elect ed. The strife seems to have been between the Bray section and the Worthington road, and the contest was not only warm but bitter and determined, re sulting in three elections and as many contests; and it is safe to say the defeated party is still dissatis fied. The person who has lived longest on the same farm or in the same location is Walter B. Mc- Creary, having made his home where he now lives, in 1816. In the spring of 1830, Alexander Devilblis laid out the village of Alexandria, and the same year a frame dwelling was put up by Riley Parker on the lot now occupied by L. S. Chadwick for a grocery. The following year Stiles Parker built the first building erected expressly for a store, on the lot upon which stands the store-house of D. S. Owen, the lot being a present from Devilblis to Parker, if he would erect such a building. About 1833, a post office was established in the village, and the first captain in the township (San ford Converse) was also the first postmaster. The village contained in 1870, three hundred and three inhabitants, and the township one thou sand one hundred and ten. In 1800 the township had one thousand one hundred and forty-eight in habitants. There are five houses of worship in the township, three located in Alexandria \u2014 the Methodist Epis copal, the Congregationalist and the Baptist. On the road from Granville to Columbus, and two miles southeast of Alexandria, is located the house belonging to the Methodist Episcopal church, known as the Gaffield meeting-house, and three miles south of Alexandria, and on the township line road, is located the Wesleyan Methodist chap el. The Methodist Episcopal church was organiz ed first, probably in 181 1 or 18 1 2; the Congrega tionalist next in order, in 1820 or 1821; the Baptist in 1826, and the Wesleyan Methodist church in 1844. The Methodists erected the first building exclu sively for church purposes in 1830, which has been spoken of as the Gaffield meeting-house. They erected the old church in Alexandria in 1838, and the present building in 1863-4. The Baptists built the first church in Alexandria, probably in 1834. It was moved on the land now owned by David Buxton when the present ed ifice was erected, and is now used for a barn. The present house was built in 1839. The pastor is Rev. A. Y. Yale, whose biography appears elsewhere in this work. In addition to his pastoral labors he is now conducting a very neat periodical called the Church and Home. The first number made its appearance in October, r88o. It is published by A. W. Yale, pastor of the Bap tist church in the village, and is a very neat and excellently prepared serial. It will be monthly in its issues and will be a valuable volume, when bound, for the library shelves. The editor, Rev. Yale, has had considerable experience as an editor and publisher, and is a practical printer. He at tended college about three years preparing himself for his labors as a religious teacher. Among his newspapers have been the Wichita (Kansas) Trib une, of which he was the originator. He started this paper when Wichita was a town of only one"], [603, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 593 thousand persons; now it is a city, and the paper has a lar^e circulation. Rev. Yale also conducted the McPherson Messenger and other similar papers. The Church and Home is printed at the Times office in Granville, and makes its appearance about the fifteenth of each month. The Congregationalists still worship in the house they first erected in the year 1839. St. Albans Congregational Church. \u2014 Monday, August 23, 1880, at half past ten a. m., an ecclesias tical council convened at the Christian Union church, three miles north of Alexandria, to con sider the expediency of organizing a Congregation al church at that place. The council was composed of Rev. SamuelJWol cutt, 1). D., of Cleveland, Rev. E. I. Jones and Abraham Flory, of Plymouth Congregational church of Newark, Rev. D. S. Jones and Newton Parker, of the Congregational church of Alexan dria, and Rev. John McKean and Deacon James Follett, of the Congregational church of Hartford. Doctor Wolcutt read the letter missive calling the council, after which he was chosen moderator and Rev. John McKean, scribe. Reasons for the proposed organization were given by D. C. Brooks and Rev. R. W. Graham, in view of which the council voted unanimously in favor of the organization. The following programme was then observed: Invocation and reading the scriptures by Rev. John McKean,' of Hartford. Sermon by Rev. E. I. Jones, of Newark. Reading the confession of faith, and covenant for the assent of the church, and prayer of conse cration, by the moderator. Address expressing the fellowship of the churches, by Rev. D. S. Jones, of Alexandria. Prayer by Rev. Mr. Yale, pastor of the regular Baptist church of Alexandria. Benediction by Rev. Mr. Vaughn, pastor of the Free Will Baptist church of Concord. The new organization contains fifty-three mem bers, of which forty-two were members of the Christian Union church, ten of the Free Will Bap tist church, and one of the Methodist Episcopal church. They have entered into the organization heartily, and it promises well for the future. Rev. R. VV. Graham, who has been their pastor for years, and who is now a member of the new organization, will doubtless be chosen their pastor. The Wesleyan Methodist Connection organized a class at the brick school-house in 1844, and in the winter of 1847-8 organized at the present loca tion and built a house of worship on the township line road, but in Harrison township, in the year 1848. They built their present house on the op posite side of the road, or in St. Albans in 1866. In 1819 a Mr. Smith, agent for some persons in Granville, supposed to be Sawyer, Mower & Co., came into the township and erected a small plank house near the Clemons (now Spelman's) mill, and opened a small store, keeping a few things, and was engaged in boring for salt during the fall and winter of 18 19, and winter and spring of 1820. A well was sunk in the bed of Mootz run, near Spelman's mill, to the depth of five hundred and fifty feet, and another near Gilbert's mills about four hundred and fifty feet deep, when from some cause the efforts for salt were discontinued. In boring the well near Mr. Palmerton's they passed through a vein of coal from ten to fifteen feet in thickness, between the third and fourth hundred feet in depth. Both wells afford a con stant supply of water, but at what depth they be came artesian wells has not been ascertained. In 1825 Knowles Linnell, esq., of Granville, then a resident of St. Albans, built a clock factory on his farm and near the brick school-house. The building now stands east of Lyman Carter's resi dence, and is used by him for a hay and sheep barn. One Charles Lewis was to do the work when the factory was built, but he proving a fail ure was soon dismissed, and in the spring of 1826 William Munsell, esq., went for Charles French, a clock maker then residing in Delaware county, and secured his services for Linnell. He removed the same spring and worked in the factory during the spring and summer. In the fall William H. Brace, a brother-in-law of French, came from the east and worked the remainder of that year and also during the year 1827. In the spring of 1828 French and Brace moved to Granville to follow their trade. They were sons-in-law of Elder Wild man, who organized the Baptist church of St. Albans in 1826."], [604, "594 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. There were made in the factory about eleven hundred clocks, which were sold in this and the adjoining counties. William Munsell, esq., was salesman or clock peddler, as they were usually called, for the manu facturers. CHAPTER LXXIII. UNION TOWNSHIP.

' ' Go cross their wilds as I have done. From snowy crest to sleeping vales, And you will find on every one Enough to swell a thousand tales.\" \u2014 Joaquin Miller. IN a very interesting article on \"American Anti- quities\" Samuel Park, esq., of Marshall, Ill- inois, a former resident of Union township in this county, writes regarding mounds in this township: \"Having been quite familiar, in early life, with the location of several fine mounds in the northeast part of Union, as well as a tew in Granville township, and knowing that some of them afforded a fine prospect of Licking valley, I determined to ascend to the top of one on my old farm (now the Licking County Infirmary farm), and look for something to write about. \"When I reached the summit of the mound, I was astonished at the change that had taken place since I last visited that elevation, some twenty years ago. Much of the timber had been removed from the surrounding country, especially to the west, which had greatly extended the view from this point. While sitting on this elevated tumulus and contemplating the beauty of the scenery, I began to call to mind the several mounds with which I had been familiar in other years, within a radius of two or three miles, and being well acquainted with the topog- raphy of the surrounding country, I was astonished to see that they occupied so nearly a common level on the hill-tops, and that, with a little more timber removed, all were in plain view from the position I then occupied; and further, that of some ten or more that I could then call to mind on a territory of some twenty-five or thirty square miles, nearly if not quite all of 'them could be seen from each and all the others; and further, that while there was an extensive common view to all of them, yet each mound overlooked a valley or plain, more or less of which could not be seen from any other one. \"To make this more clear, let me specify a few cases, to-wit: From the position we now occupied we had a delightful pros- pect of the country for many miles around us, extending west into Harrison township, north into Granville, and to the east and southeast the whole Licking valley was spread out before us. Looking over the numerous hill-tops of Hog run and Up- per Clay lick, the sight was lost in the hill-tops beautifully delin- eated on the horizon, extending in a semi-circle from the hills of the Rocky fork to the coal hills of Perry county, while the spec- ial view from this mound, and not to be seen from any other, lies to the northwest. Three or four mounds on a ridge along the line between Union and Granville townships command the view, respectively, of deep valleys lying on the north and south sides of this ridge, while one on Stephen Gill's farm, and others on the farms of Aaron Hillbrant, Mrs. Owens, Mr. Jones and John Haynes, south of Auter creek, and others on the lands of F. Dunlevy, Wesley Belt, Henry Lytle and others north of the railroad, each and all have their special views, not to be seen from any other mound, and still are all in plain view from the mound above Union station, on the infirmary farm. Those mounds are all situated on high hills, but we have found since that there are many other mounds on the same territory, gener- ally situated on slight elevations at the head of ravines, on the banks of streams, etc. \" The discovery of these peculiarities began to open a new train of thoughts on the mound question, and begat a desire for further investigation. We next visited some of the hills north of the Raccoon valley, among which was Fort hill, so called. This is one of the highest elevations belonging to this range of hills, and ovei looks a considerable district to the north- east, as well as an extensive portion of the Raccoon valley. On the top of this hill we found a fort enclosing some fourteen or sixteen acres of land, and in the middle of it another, with a deep moat inside of the wall, less than one hundred feet in di- ameter. The inside of this is considerably elevated, but ap- pears to have been dug down by some person seeking for treas- ure or curiosities. We have often been surprized at the vain hopes of some persons that they might find a fortune in some of these mounds. Can any sane person for a moment indulge the thought that there ever was a people or nation so ignorant as to erect such conspicuous piles to secrete treasure, with any hope of its safety? Nor since silver and gold have been used by man as the representative of wealth, have we any account of any nation or tribe that buried with their dead any considerable amount of the precious metals, or anything else of lasting value. It is all lost labor to seek in such places for treasure or valuable jewels, for they are not there. These works were raised for no such purpose. There may be found a few trinkets"], [605, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 595 placed there with their dead, a thousand years since the erection of the mounds, by some of the wandering tribes' of our native Indians; but, beyond this, you might as well seek for the treas- ures of Babylon in its ruins, or for the gold of Solomon's tem- ple, that so dazzled the eyes and astonished the rich Queen of Sheba, or that excited the covetousness of the Assyrian hosts, by a search among the rubbish of that ruined pile, as to seek among these monuments for the treasures of these ancient Americans. We must find some other use for these works more in harmony with the human mind, or of its conception of the nature and relation of things, than that of treasure tombs or military works, or acknowledge that we knew nothing about them. We shall assume that they are the monuments of a civil government, with but little of the military or mortuary character about them, and will try our theory by the works themselves, and leave to others to judge of its plausibility. \"We next visited \"Alligator Hill.\" Herewe found quite a curiosity. Tt isa pretty fair artificial representation of the alli- gator, or great American crocodile. We did not measure this singular tumulus, but would suppose it to be about two hundred feet long, and the length of its legs from forty-five to fifty feet each. Its tail is curled to one side, and its length from the juncture of the legs is some one hundred feet. It is situated on a high hill* and affords a fine prospect of the surrounding coun- try. This animal-shaped tumulus has probably been eight or ten feet high, and may have been a represention of the tribal en- sign or coat of arms. Some have thought that it was an object of worship, but there is nothing in the surroundings that will justify such a theory. There may have been, and probably was, a small temple of worship on Fort Hill, but not here. \"I think several of the mounds in Union might be seen from this position if the timber were removed from the hills south of the Raccoon valley. From this point we selected several other distant elevations, on which, we thought, there ought to be some kind of artificial works to justify the theory we were about to adopt, Some of these we have since visited and found mounds of greater or less magnitude at each point. \"We next visited an elevation about a mile south of Union Station, on the old farm of Henry Hillbrant. Here is a double-walled fort, about seventy-five rods in diameter, with two mounds inside of it. The walls, with the ditch between them, have occupied a base of some fifty-feet. There are some forty rods of the circumvallation that is in the timber and has not been ploughed, but the balance of it has been in cultivation about forty years, and is in many places nearly effaced so that it is at present difficult to determine how many or where the openings were, but from appearances I think there have been gates, or openings, to the north, the east and the southeast, toward three fine springs that are some thirty or forty rods distant, at the base of the hill. From the present appearance one, if not all of these springs, may have at some former period broken out of the hill-side near to it, if not within the line of the works, but at present they are all at the base of the hill. The prospect from this elevation is very fine, and embraces nearly the same territory as that from the mound on the Infirm- ary farm, with a fine additional view to the south, and a view of a portion of Cherry valley, that is intercepted by hills from those mounds north of the railroad. The fine mound near the site of the old Twining mill, on the Raccoon branch of Licking river, the mounds in the upper part of Cherry valley, and those p the Auter creek valley, near the old English mill, as well as the works at the fair grounds, and others on the Cherry valley, all would come under the view from this elevation, though from five to seven miles distant. From this point the hills south of Newark appear to be in a valley, while those farther east appear to loom up above them. From this elevation I selected some seven or eight objective points of elevation, lying to the south and southwest, and ranging from one to six miles distant from this point of observation, on which I thought there should be mounds or watch-towers to effect a complete view of the whole face of the country, especially to overlook the great valley of the Pataskala river above Hebron, but on none of which did I know of the existence of any artificial works. \"I was sufficiently well acquainted with the country to know in what particular neighborhood each of these elevations was situated, and to satisfy myself on this point, I obtained a horse and started to examine the several locations. On the first I found a fort (so-called), about two hundred feet in diameter, and a mound in the middle of it. This is on the farm of Aaron Hillbrant, and has been in cultivation for many years, but still is well defined. The second point was a ridge on the old John Ruffner farm, about one and a half miles northeast from Lick ing church. On the west end of the ridge I found a fine mound some ten to fifteen feet high, and about forty rods east of it is an oblong, oval fort one hundred and fifty by two hundred feet in diameter, and on the east end of the ridge, and about a half mile from the former, is another fine mound, and the remains of an artificial pool near to it. This pool has been about one hundred feet in diameter, and the bank thrown up to form the pool well defined, but has at one point been swept away, so as to nearly drain the pool. The top of the ridge where this is situated is so narrow that the water falls off to the north and south from the banks of the pool. With the broken part re stored, this pool would still be some six feet deep. These works are all in the timber, and have not been disturbed bv the plow. My fourth point was a high hill, a half mile west of Licking church, on James Black's land. Here, too, is a fine mound that has recently been opened in search of treasure. My fifth point was on Thomas Stone's farm. Here, too, is a mound that can be seen in some directions for several miles. My sixth was a ridge lying between the residence of William Moore and that of Joseph Rhodes. On the east end of this ridge have been two small mounds, that have been nearly blown away by the winds, and near the west end there is another small mound. The seventh was on the lands of Mr. H. Kagy, near to the former residence of the late Colonel W. W. Gault. Here, too, is a mound; but the last three or four mounds have the appear ance of never having been finished. My next point was on the high lands, in the vicinity of Nelson Buckland's. This point 1 did not visit, but was informed by Christopher Winters, esq., that there is one on his farm, which joins that of Mr. Buckland. I put up over night with my old friend and associate of my youth, James Wells, esq., who with his excellent wife were pio neer children, and enter fully into the spirit of these pioneer resurrections. My next point was on the west line of the town ship, and south of the Central Ohio railroad, in the vicinity of where Asa Brown lives. This is usually called a low, wet, beech country, but is in reality an elevated plain or ridge, that marks itself clearly on the horizon, when viewed from other dis tant elevations. I started for Mr. Brown's and traveled up the Pataskala or south branch of Licking river, to the town line. Near the banks of the river I found several small mounds, but 1 found my principal observatory, or signal mound, on the farm of Mr. Clark, a half mile south of Mr. Brown's. I again"], [606, "596 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. the south side of this mound there appears to have been a land slide that has considerably reduced the grade of the ascent on that side, throwing it a little out of a regular circle, and giving it rather a semi-oblate form. On the north side, there has been a narrow, graded road for ascending the mound. This has been nearly destroyed by cultivation, but still can be seen. But the great curiosity in connection with this mound, and a pecu- liarity that I have not found in any other, is the remains of a massive vault in the southwest part of the mound, that has nearly or quite extended to its center. From the present appearance, this vault must have been not less than sixty by one hundred feet, and possibly much more than that. By its falling in, it has left the top of the mound in the form of a crescent or semi-circle, and doubtless has greatly reduced its altitude. I think that the bottom of the vault has been nearly on a level with the surrounding plain. There also appears to have been a narrow subterranean passage through the mound, from the north side of the mound to the vault. This is indi- cated by a narrow sink in the walls of the mound, that extends from the vault to the northern extremity of the mound. This transverse sink in the wall is yet clearly manifest, though the plow has passed over it several times. The length of this sub- terranean passage to the main cave or vault, must have been nearly two hundred feet. How the roof of this great artificial cavern may have been sustained, whether by an arch of sun dried brick, or otherwise, is left to conjecture; but if all other mysteries were solved that now surround some of these works, we could soon find means to sustain the roof of the caverns. \"Some thirty or thirty-five rods south of the mound is an ex- cavation of considerable extent, from which a portion of the material to erect this pile was doubtless obtained. The soil of this mound is very fertile, while a portion of the surrounding plain is comparatively sterile. There are other tumuli around this at various distances that are in plain view from this. Among them are some in an unfinished state, others are com- plete; but none other possessed the threefold character of watch- tower, signal point and magazine for stores. From a half mile to a mile and a quarter to the northeast from this singular mound, is a series of knobs, or tumuli, of not less than fifty on an area of some three hundred acres of land. Most of these have always been considered by the citizens natural elevations, though there are among them several well defined artificial mounds, and some things in others that give them the appear- ance of a series of artificial works, or perhaps rather, natural elevations with artificial termini. While looking among these hillocks, which range from eight to fifty feet in height, and of various forms, I noticed that from the side of one of them a tree had fallen, that had turned up a root of some six feet in depth, which would reach to the level of the surrounding plain. This I examined, and found that it had brought up from the bottom a stratum of rich black soil, apparently of drift forma- tion, while above it was a mixture of clay loam and gravel. This mound was not less than a hundred feet above the alluvium or bottoms of Auter creek, aud nearly a mile distant from its channel. This straitification of earth in this tree root showed not only that this was an artificial tumulus, but that it had been erected on the original surface soil. Not more than two hun- dred feet from this is found the largest mound that I have seen in the county, or that I have ever seen, except Everman's mound, in Jasper county in the State of Illinois. But there are in this State some larger mounds. This is nearly round, between hree and four hundred feet in diameter at the base, and, It called on Mr. ' Brown, to whom I was already indebted for many items in my Pioneer paper, but I did not find Mr. Brown so well posted on the mound question, and perhaps disposed to be a little skeptical as to my theory. But after spending an hour very pleasantly, and partaking of an excellent dinner with a wedding party, I again started north on the town line till I crossed the railroad. Here we found mounds on both side of the township line. From here we traveled west and north till we reached the old Columbus road from Granville, near to the residence of Colonel John C. Alward. \"On this trip I found several mounds, some in the vicinity of Ezekiel Cunningham, esq., but the largest is on the farm of Zephaniah Alward. The summit of this would command the view of a large scope of country if the timber were removed, and signals could be easily exchanged between this and those on the hills near Hebron, or with those about Union Station, and perhaps with not more than one repeating, to Columbus. I put up with Mr. John Deeds, on York street, and spent one day in this vicinity, and found several mounds. From here I travel ed south and crossed the South fork into \u00c6tna township, and down the county line, south of the Bloody Run swamp to the Baltimore road, thence to Hebron, and along the east line of the township, back to Union Station. In this trip I sometimes laid down fences and rode through farms, and sometimes would [eave my horse and walk a mile to examine some objective point, and I have found these mounds everywhere on this terri tory, both on the hills and plains, in sufficient number to over look the whole surface of the land, and I do not believe that within the bounds of my research there can be found a single fifty acre lot that can not be viewed from some one or more of these artificial mounds. I have examined the location of more than one hundred, and have not found a single exception to the rule that each one is so situated as to command a view, more or less of which cannot be seen from any other, except in a few instances where they were double or in pairs. This rule, how ever, would not hold good where they are found on a level plain in clusters, which is sometimes the case. On this trip I met with Mr. Jesse Thompson, of Hebron, but formerly of Fairfield county, Ohio, who informed me that when he first settled on Walnut creek, in Fairfield county, about the beginning of the present century, there was a graded road, easily traced in the timber; that it was some thirty or forty feet wide between the ditches, and appeared to be as old as the forts and mounds and he always thought it to be a road leading from the works near Newark to those at Circleville, as it was on a line between those points. But I have met with nothing of the kind, nor do t suppose that, in the present improved state of the country it could be found. \"There are some of these mounds that appear to be in an unfinished state, and some that must have been intended to answer some other purpose than that usually assigned them, or of signal points. There are several mounds on the lands of Mr. Dunlevy, and some of peculiar character. There is one west of the public road that is, by way of eminence, called \"the mound,' because of its being larger than any other in that vicinity, that I will try to describe. It is situated a half mile north of the creek and nearly a half mile west of the public road, on a gently undulating plain. This mound is about twenty rods in diameter at the base, and, although it has been in cultivation many years, and every effort made to reduce its heighth by plowing around it (for it is too steep in its ascent for a team to pass over it), it is still some thirty feet high. On"], [607, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 597 should think, fifty feet high. There are two or more other well defined artificial* mounds on my father's farm, now owned by Wesley Belt, but the greater portion of these elevations are on lands that were owned, when I left this State, by Reuben Lin nel, Justin Hilly er and James Cunningham, all of which I believe is now owned by Mr. F. Dunlevy. \"There are among these knobs some ponds of water which 1 think are artificial pools. Though the land there is generally quite porous, and the water passes away quickly, still, from some cause some of these pools are very retentive, and hold water nearly or quite the year round. As we go west from this singular cluster of elevations, along the line of Union and Granville townships, we find quite a number of mounds, some of which are clearly in an unfinished state, while others are neatly and scientifically completed. It will be seen from the above that this township is rich in antiquarian relics. This gentleman, in the same article, gives his theory regarding these mounds and their builders, which differs somewhat from the generally received theories, and will be found in another part of this work. In another article he says regarding the subject of antiquities; \"There were, at the first settlement of the township, many rel ics of antiquity found, such as axes, hatchets, pipes and ham mers of stone, broken pottery, etc. If these had been pre served, a respectable cabinet of curiosities might have been gathered in this county alone. But no one then thought of the value they might have been to science, and they have been lost or destroyed. There was on my old farm, when first improved, a very remarkable pile of \"flint chips,\" and broken, and unfin ished, \"arrow points,' amounting to several bushels. These were at a place where neither flint nor stone were found beside them. Their presence there was a mystery to all who saw them; it was called by the early settlers the 'Indian arrow shop, and the hunters used to resort there to get their gun-flints. The nearest place from whence they could be brought must have been the Flint ridge, some ten or twelve miles distant.\" The following general history of this township was also written by Mr. Park: \"This is the largest township in Licking county. It em braces about one and a half square miles in town -one, range twelve, and the whole of town one, range thirteen, United States military lands. Also sections one to eighteen inclusive, in town seventeen, range eighteen, of the Refugee lands on the south, embracing an area of more than forty square miles. The south part of the township is watered by the south branch of Licking, or the Pataskala river, which also constitutes a part of the east line of the township. The middle is watered by the Beaver run and its branches, and the north by Auter creek and its tributaries. These all pass through its territory nearly from west to east, making it a uniformly well watered township. The face of the country is generally level, or gently undulating. The soil is a clay loam, rich with vegetable mould, sufficiently retentive to hold stimulating manure without leaching, yet the subsoil is generally so porous as to need but little draining. It is as well, if not better, adapted to a variety agriculture, than any township in the county. \"There are no broken or waste lands in the township, except 28 a small district in the southeast corner, covered by the Licking Summit reservoir, and another small district in the southwest, by the Pigeon-roost or Bloody Run swamp. The latter has been greatly improved, within a few years past, by draining, and may yet be fully redeemed and become fine meadow land, or afford a valuable bed of rich fertilizing matter to enrich other lands with. Nearly the whole of the eighteen sections taken from the Refugee lands, and lying in the south part of the township, is an alluvion, and is rarely equaled as corn and meadow land; while the middle and northern portions of the township are more rolling and better adapted to the production of small grain and fruit trees. \"The public improvements are the Ohio canal, tbe Cumber land road, and the Central Ohio railroad. The first was com pleted through this township and county in the summer of 1828, the second in 1834, and the third in 1853. These, each in their turn, gave a great impetus to local improvements. These all run entirely through the township, and the canal and National road cross nearly at right angles within its territorv, and afford ample facilities for getting its products to market. Hebron, its principal town, and situated at the crossing of the canal and National road, was once a fine business point, and, in the days of its glory, the largest and best grain and pork market in the county, if not in the Licking valley. But since the men that made it such have passed away, and railroad facil ities have attracted the commerce to other points, Hebron has lost its prestige as a commercial point, and, with it, much of its moral and religious enterprise. The towns of Moscow and Lu ray have nearly passed away. There is a small business done at Union station, oa the roilroad. These are the only villages in the township, from which it will be seen that Union is em phatically an agricultural township. Although its villages are on the decline, both as to their population and business, its agricultural interests are improving. The lands are generallv owned and occupied by an enterprising class of farmers that are rapidly developing the resources of its rich soil. ' ' It was very heavily timbered, and required as much hard labor to bring it into cultivation as any township in the county. The better kinds of timber consisted of black walnut, butter nut, wild cherry, several varieties of oak, white, black and blue ash, hickory, mulberry and sugar maple. The less valuable were the beech, elm, basswood or linden, black gum, cotton wood, sycamore, buckeye, etc., with underbrush of dogwood, red-bud, paw-paw, wild plum, spice brush, and, in many places, abundance of wild grapes and black haws. The apparent superabundance of timber induced such a reckless prodigalitv in its use and destruction, that good timber is becoming very scarce, and many farmers begin to feel much anxiety about a future supply of fencing and fuel. \"The principal productions of the south part of the town ship, for many years, were corn and hay, which were generally fed to hogs, horses and cattle; while in the middle and north ern portions more attention was given to the growth of all the cereals, as well as the cultivation of potatoes, turnips, flax, hemp, etc. Wheat was grown with good success for many years, but af ter awhile failures became more frequent from rust and the wheat midge, and for the last twenty-five years the farmers have given their attention to the growth of live stock, princi pally sheep, rather than to the production of grain. While this township gives attention to the growth of all kinds of live stock common to this part of the country, it stands first in the"], [608, "59s HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. county for the number of its sheep, and is one of the most fa- mous wool-growing districts in the State. ' ' In the early settlement of this part of the county, the citi- zens manufactured a large amount of maple sugar, not only a supply for their home consumption, but considerable quantities for market. But the low price at which the cane-sugar could be had, for some time previous to the late war, caused the destruc- tion of the sugar groves to such an extent that there is now but little sugar made in the township. Many have tried the several varieties of sorghum, with some success, as a substitute for the maple and the southern sugar and molasses, but to those ac- customed to the use of the maple sugar and molasses, its use is not very palatable. \"There has been but little attention given to manufactures of any kind in this part of the county, except sawing lumber. The first settlers, however, manufactured all their own clothing and other textile goods for domestic use. The carding, spinning, and weaving was generally all done in the family. The first mill in Union township was built by Phineas Ford in 1803, on Auter creek, some forty rods below where his first cabin was erected, it was a small temporary log building ; the millright work, as well as the mill-iron, and the mill-stones (which were made from boulders, or nigger-heads, found on the surface of the ground), was all done by Mr. Ford himself. This mill was in a few years swept away by a flood. The mill-stones remain on the farm of Mr. Ford, a relic of antiquity. This mill was succeeded by another on the same stream built by James Mc- Cauley, in 1802 or 1803, but within the bounds of Newark township. The second mill in Union was built by John Good, on South fork, near the mouth of Bloody run, in 1807, this was kept up for some twenty years, but also passed away. Daniel Green erected another on the same stream, near Mos- cow, about the year r830. There was another below this, erected some years before by Matthew Black, but it stood on the east side of the river, within the present bounds of Licking township. The last two are still kept running, but are in a state of dilapidation. \"In the year 1820 Joseph Mantonya erected water works on Auter creek, a little above the site of the old Ford mill, for the purpose of manufacturing sickles and augers, to which he attached a mill for grinding. This establishment was of great value to this county at that time. Mr. Mantonya was a good workman, and the demand for his sickles was large, as the small grain in those days was all cut with the sickle. This manufactory was suc- cessfully carried on several years, until Mr. Mantonya left his shop to become a contractor in building the Ohio canal. It then remained comparatively idle until the spring of 1830, when it was repaired and again put into successful operation by Mr. Mantonya and Samuel Park. In a few years, perhaps in the year 1835, it was sold to Phinehas Ford and his son Benjamin, who converted it into a saw-mill. In the year i83r John Park erected a saw-mill where Union Station now is, and in 1832 Samuel Vance erected another, a mile below; and in 1833 Messrs. S. H. Joseph and J. Downer erected another a half mile above, all on the same stream, making four saw-mills with- jn a distance of one and a half miles. These were all kept up nearly twenty years, and some of them more. Almost every rod of the channel of Auter creek, from its mouth to the Joseph & Downer mill above the fork, has at some time been occupied for mill purposes, and at the early settling of the country it was a good mill stream; but since the country has been cleared up it does not afford water enough to be worth occupying for that purpose. It may have been noticed that this stream is called Auter creek, when it is generally known by the name of Ramp creek. The latter is a misnomer, and originated as follows: \u2014 At the first settling of this country, and up to about the year 1820, the wide and fertile bottoms along this stream were covered in earlv spring with a wonderful growth of leeks, which the Vir- ginians and Pennsylvanians called Ramps; these were eaten freely by the cattle in the spring, before other vegetation came on to supply their wants. This gave a very unpleasant smell to the breath of the cattle, and a disgusting flavor to the milk and butter. This, however, was partially neutralized and rendered endurable by a person eating freely of raw onions or garlick before partaking of the milk and butter, but it did not remove the bitterness of feeling entertained by the citizens against those early plants, and about the year 1807 or r8o8, the first settlers along this valley applied the name of these plants to the stream on whose rich bottom lands they grew so abundantly, and it has never been so far redeemed from its \"rampy reproach,\" as to be called by its proper name. The name Auter creek is French, and signifies another creek. This name may have orig- inated in the very singular circumstance of so many streams of so nearly the same size forming a junction so nearly at the same point, as do the several branches of Licking river. The only wool carding machines ever run in Union township were, one erected by N. Buckland & Brother in 1829, and another by a gentleman in Hebron, some three or four years later; but these have both long since ceased to operate. \"There is a tile factory in Hebron, and a carriage factory in the town of Luray, which are all the manufacturing establish, ments of any importance now in the township. \" The first canal-boat built in the county, or that floated on the waters of the Ohio canal within its borders, was built by a joint-stock company at Hebron, in 1827-8, and was called the \"Licking Summit.\" It was built under the supervision of Joshua Smith, and made its first trip through the \"Deep cut\" on the Fourth of July, r828, but it was built too large to pass the locks, and was so poorly constructed and drew so much water that it was not thought worth reconstructing, consequently, it never jest the summit level. It was laid up in he basin at Hebron, for a while used as a drinking saloon\u2014 then as a resort for the lewd, or a kind of house of ill-fame, until it was destroyed as a nuisance, or rotted down. This statement is in part confirmed by Captain John Murphy, formerly as this county, and now of Knox county, Ohio, who also furnished the information that he run the first boat through from Cleveland to Portland. It is also corroborated by Mr. H. H. Denis, of Newark, and Messrs. James Sawyer and Dr. James Ewing, and John Edwards, esq.. of Hebron. \"The distilleries were another class of manufactories that were of too much importance in those days to be passed without notice, for their product was used by nearly everybody, and was considered an article of necessity in every household. Even among the clergy there were some that thought the exhiler- ating effects of the spirit of the 'still' was quite essential to an effective elucidation of the 'Spirit of the Sacred Writings.' The importance of the stills may be conceived from the prompt- ness with which they sprang into existence, after the erection of the cabin in the wilderness, for the protection of the family from the inclemency of the season, and the production of a little surplus grain for them to operate on. The first distillery in Union township, so far as we can learn, was erected by Abram Mouser in 1809, a little east of Thomas Stone's farm,"], [609, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 599 this was soon followed by one erected by James Taylor, another by Samuel Hand, and others, as the population and demand increased. The distilleries of those days supplied their custom ers, as did the mills, by giving every man his turn. When the bag with grain was taken to the mill, it was marked and left there to be ground, when all others were ground that had pre ceeded it. Just so at the 'still house,' every man left his jug or bottle to be filled, when all the jugs and bottles were filled that had preceeded it. It was quite common among the better class of citizens, when they sent for their meal, to send another bag of grain to take its turn, lest the family wants should get ahead of the turns at the mill, which was quite common in dry weather. Just so with those that patronized the still-house, when the full jug was taken away an empty one must be left for its turn, otherwise an involuntary total abstinence might have to be endured for awhile, unless relieved by some kind neigh\" bor. Happv indeed was the man thought to be, whose means were such that he could afford to get a whole barrel stowed away in some safe place, where he could resort to it at his plea sure for the comfort of himself and friends. \" In those pioneer days it was considered a specific for nearly all the woes that the flesh of man was heir to, and by some for both soul and body. It warmed them when cold; it protected them in the harvest field from the evil effects of a scorching sun; it soothed their sorrows; it calmed their fears; it gave them courage in a fight; or it allayed the excited feelings of anger and made friends of those who had been at enmity. It braced up the system under fatigue, and protected it from the evil effects of a storm, of either rain or snow. It sharpened their appetite for their food, and sustained them under long fasting. It cured rheumatism, cholic, and headache, and was an excel lent remedy for a cold. It was a protection against the malaria of a new country, and one of the finest emollients for bruised flesh, ora sprained limb in the world. Indeed, it was a uni- versal specific for all their sufferings in this life, whether phys- ical, mental, or moral. No patent medicine of modern days could compare with it; and that, too, without any newspaper puffing \u2014 for it was well understood to be adapted to every age and sex. It was the first thing given to the baby, and the last thing applied to the cold clay of the mortal body to hold it to a natural freshness until laid in the tomb. \" Was it any wonder that an article of such universal adapta- tion should be promptly provided for? Then its importance as an article of commerce, in those days should not be overlooked; many of the farmers paid for their land with it. When there was no market for their grain, their fruit, or their live stock, they had but to trade or convert it into whiskey or brandy. when it at once became substantially a legal tender, for no man ever heard in those days of a person refusing to take it for a debt. It was the rich man's glory and the poor man's conso- lation. \"So far as can be ascertained at this late day, Asa Shinn was the first man that ever preached within the present bounds of Union township, and the place was at the cabin of George Wells, in the year 1803 or 1804. A society was soon after or ganized here, and John Price was appointed class-leader. About this time there was a local preacher, by the name of Smith, settled near the south line of the township, but there are no particulars in regard to his religious labors, farther than that he was a very active and energetic Christian. In the year 1812 they erected a good hewed log meeting-house on the land of George Wells, and called it 'Wells' meeting-house.' Thjs was superceded in the year 1833 by a large brick, called 'George's chapel.' This society became so weakened by deaths and removals, that many years ago it was dis banded, and its members attached to other points, and the meeting-house torn down. * In r8os Benjamin Green, a Baptist preacher, commenced preaching at David Beaver's and a few years after this, a society was formed at this place from mem bers that had been attached to the churches of Hog run and Pleasant run, and held their meetings at the house of David Beaver. About the year 1815 or i8r6 they erected a hewed log church, with gallery on the sides and one end; this was for some time called ' Beavers meeting-house, ' but was subsequently named 'Licking church.' This society, with some modifica tions, continues in a prosperous condition, and now have a good frame church and a well improved cemetery. The people on Auter creek, for many years, attended meeting at Mr. Nash's, within the bounds of Granville township, but soon after the War of 1812, a society was formed at the house of John Park, and John Black was appointed class-leader. This continued to be a regular preaching place, until the erection of Park chapel in 1840-r. There are several other pretty good churches in the township, but of modern date. Although the people of Union did not, like those of Granville, bring their re ligious instructor with them, they have always given respectful attention to religious instruction. They came here in small parties and from various points, representing almost every faith that was taught in the older states, including the Puritans, Bap tists, Methodists, Lutherans, Quakers, Moravians, Dunkards, Universalists and Unitarians. \"The first school is said to have been taught in the neighbor hood of David Beaver's in the year r8o5, by a Mr. Livingston. The next, of which there is any account, was taught in the Ben jamin settlement, by Sallie Gavit, in 1809 or 1810. She taught two terms, and was followed by Miss Sarah Baldwin, Mr. Lock wood, Miss Harriet Munsel (now Mrs. H. Gaffield of St. Albans), and Miss M. Twigg. In 1813 this part of Union and the southeast part of Granville, united and built a school house, on what is now the McMillen farm, and that winter the school was taught by Oliver Thrall, and in r8i6 and 1817 by Daniel Howe; in 1818, by Miss Barsha Howe, now Mrs. Hillver, of Kansas. The territory was again divided, and the Union portion erected a school-house on Auter creek, Miss Hannah Ford {now Mrs. Benjamin, of Iowa), taught one or two terms; then Mr. Driggs, followed hy James Corbin. In 1813 and 1814 a sister of Sallie Gavit, Mrs. A. E. Bragg, of Gran ville, taught school in the Stone and Pumphrey settlement. By diligent inquiry and the aid of family records, the names of nearly all the early settlers have been ascertained, and are placed in the following order: In 1800 John VanBuskirk and Benjamin Murphy, the last week in March, and J. Wayman the same season. In r8oi-2 Jonathan Benjamin, John Horned, William Horned, George Wells, John Edwards, Alexander Holmes, Richard Wells, Joseph Wells, Bazeleel Wells, James Hendricks. William Wells, William Richardson, John Wagy, James Green, Henry Owens, and Phineas Ford.

There are others who died out of the township whose record has not been obtained, among whom are James Taylor and wife, James and George Stone and wives, Alex. Wells and wife, and Susan Park, some of whom attained an age of nearly one hundred years. \"It may be worth noting that nearly all of these early set tlers, both male and female, were expert in the use of the rifle, and some of the men were \" professional hunters,\" who devoted much of their time to the chase, especially in the fall and winter, when the flesh and skins of wild animals were most valuable. Among these may be named Thomas Stone, Joshua Browning, John Edwards, John Price, John and Elias Farmer, and John Coulter, as among the most expert of their day. Thomas Stone was distinguished as a bear hunter, sometimes killing as many as eight to twelve in a season. These men were seldom seen at any time, even at church, without their rifle. Some of them did not feel themselves fully dressed until their \"hunter's belt\" was buckled around them, and the shot pouch and powder-horn hung over their shoulders. They not only gloried in the chase, but with some of them it was the chief source of their living, until old age and scarcity of game compelled them to give it up. John Edwards and Thomas Stone were good farmers and fair business men, and accumu lated some property, but most of these hunters died poor. \"Joshua Browning was a man without any education, but a person of good judgment. At the time of the great meteoric shower of 1833, the alarm among many of the people was great. Almost every kind of business was suspended, and the people of the country gathered at the towns to talk about it, and to hear what others had to say. Mr. Browning said that he was out hunting and camped in the woods. In the night he saw an unusual number of \"shooting stars,\" and their number continued to increase. To get a better view of them, he left his camp and went about a quarter of a mile to open ground. Here his description of the scene was truly ludicrous, but very interesting. He watched them until his neck pained him from looking up; he then lay on his back and watched them for three hours. Having heard of a time coming when the stars of Hea ven should fall, he fixed his eyes on certain stars to see them fall, but not one of them moved. These sparkling gems that filled the atmosphere above him seemed to take their existence somewhere in the open space between him and the stars that he fixed his eyes upon, hence he concluded that this was not the \"star falling\" spoken of in the Bible. It now, to his mind, as sumed a delightful aspect; and his description, in his untutored dialect, of the dividing and multiplying character of the mete ors as they descended to the earth, though laughable, was very entertaining; and while many reading persons were frantic with fear, the scrutinizing mind of this son of nature conveited it into a scene of pleasurable delight. Joshua Browning was a man of mild temper and of good morals. He died at the age of sixty-four. His brother-in-law, Philip Smith, was a fron- tiersman in taste and habits, and died at the age of eighty-two years. \"Lovel Morris was born in New Jersey, and came to this country in the spring of 1804, living one year on Richard Pit- zer's land. He then moved to the neighborhood of Cooper's mill, on Jonathan's creek, and remained there five years, when he returned to the Hog Run valley, where he remained till 1828, when he bought land on Auter creek, in Union township. In Catharine Dewese 78 ' ' The aggregate age attained by these (sixty-five) persons is five thousand and five years, or an average of seventy-seven years."], [611, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 60 1 1834 fie sold his land to R. A. Holmes, and bought more about one mile further south, in the same township, where he remained until his death in August, 1843. His wife was a sister of old Philip Sigler, another pioneer, and died in October, 1848. Lov, el Morris was a member of the Methodist Episcopal church fifty-six years, and his wife sixty-five years. \"Thomas and George Stone came to this township from Jeffer- son county, Virginia, in 1803. They were both men of good morals and useful members of the church. George was a member of the first Methodist, and Thomas of the first Baptist societies in the township. \"John and Jacob Myers were settlers of 1805, and came from Baltimore, Maryland. John married in Brooke county, Virginia. \" He and his wife lived to a ripe old age, dying at the ages o f seventy-nine and ninety, respectively. Jacob was justice of the peace many years, and earned for himself a good reputation for integrity and judgment. \"James Holmes jr., a brother of Judge Alexander Flolmes, came from Washington county, Pennsylvania. He was an ener- getic, industrious man, the county surveyor many years and be- came wealthy. He was an eccentric character, and made a provision in his will that his body, after death, should be em- balmed and placed in a vault above ground, which was done. \"John Van Buskirk was the first person to settle in Union township, on land owned by himself. A biographical sketch of this pioneer will be found in another chapter. \"Phineas Ford was born November 1, 1772, and was the son of Thomas and Hannah P'ord, of Farmington, Connecticut. He was married to Mary Benjamin April 5, 1796. \"They, with the families of John Jones, Frederick Ford and Benoni Benjamin, placed all their effects on a flat-boat, and left the mouth of the Muskingum in September, 1799. They floated down the Ohio to the mouth of the Scioto, thence up the Scioto to a settlement about where Circleville now stands. Here they stopped and wintered with some friends who had pre- ceded them, and raised a crop. In the spring of 1801, as soon as the ice had left the river, Phinehas Ford and John Jones, with their families, and Frederick Ford, a brother-in-law as assistant, but without his family, again started with their boat up the river for Franklinton, then the first white settlement on the Scioto above Circleville. \"They reached Franklinton the last of March, and landed, where Columbus now stands, in an unbroken forest. Their team and other things were taken from the boat, and rigged on land. By the aid of a pocket-compass and a map of this part -of the Ohio Company's lands, they started for the Auter creek branch of the Licking river. The first day they broke a wheel of their wagon. Mr. Ford made some felloes for the wheel from a crooked dogwood, screwed on the tire, and started again. The next day Frederick Ford thrust his gun into a wheel to save the wagon from turning over, and broke the stock off. When coming down a steep bank on Moot's run, a grape vine caught under the yoke of the oxen, and the weight of the wagon drove them forward with such an impetus that it swung the cattle from the ground until relieved by cutting the grape vine. After passing through various dangerous as well as laughable incidents., they reached their destination April 7, 1801, and Phinehas Ford, with his wife and two daughters, set his stakes on the bank of Auter creek, about one hundred and twenty rods above where Union station on the Central Ohio railroad now stands. Here, by the aid of his wife and brother jn-law, Frederick Ford, he erected a small cabin, and covered it with bark. He made the door for his cabin by interlacing small poles together with hickory bark. \" By this time their stock of provisions was nearly exhausted, and Phineas Ford, with his brother-in-law, Frederick Ford, left Mrs. Ford with her two little girls at this lonely spot in the wilderness, and returned to the settlement on the Scioto, to ob- tain bread for their families. He was detained by high water and was absent eleven days. During this time Mrs. Ford did not see the face of a single human being besides her little chil- dren. Wild beasts were numerous and threatening. One large wolf, a little more bold than his fellows, showed a disposition to closely inspect the frail cabin and its inmates, with an ex- pression of countenance that indicated an overt act, with malice aforethought. Mrs. Ford, dreading an attack, took her rifle to shoot the intruder; but her powder had become so wet by re- cent rains that her gun would not go off. She then armed her- self, as best she could, to await an attack; but the wolf, after an hour's deliberate survey of her quarters, left her unharmed. On the eleventh day her provisions had become exhausted, and, with a degree of bravery, that bordered on desperation, she started through a trackless wilderness to find the cabin of her sister, Mrs. Lilly Jones, some four miles distant, on Raccoon creek. The forests were alive with wild beasts, and but little less wild Indians, some of whom were not friendly to the white settlers. After wandering all day with her little children, just at night, wearied and forlorn, and near to the cabin of her sis- ter, she met her husband, safely returning with supplies for their immediate wants. During these eleven days of her husband's absence, Mrs. Ford had not seen an Indian; but on the next day after his return, several came to their cabin to beg, or to exchange wild meat for bread. These were quite friendly, and said they had come near the cabin several times while Mr. Ford was absent, but did not show themselves, for fear the 'white squaw would be frightened.' These wild sons of the forest continued to visit and maintain friendly relations with this family so long as they continued to linger around the graves of their ancestors. \"Phineas Ford and his brother-in-law had come to the Lick- ing valley on a proposition from the agent of some eastern land holders to donate fifty acres of land to each family, on condition of their occupying and improving it for a term of years, and encouraging a settlement; and when these land-holders afterward sold their land in large quantities, these donated lots were re- served and deeded to those who in good faith opened the way or a settlement in the wilderness. Phineas Ford at once went to work to improve the land that continued to be his home till his death, April 7, 1839, thirty-nine years to a day from the time he built his first camp-fire on that fifty acre lot. Mrs. Ford con. tinued to occupy it nearly sixty-four years. Mr. Ford's New England education and taste induced him to at once provide for an orchard of fruit trees by planting seeds that he had brought with him ; and some of the first apple trees planted in Granville were taken from Phineas Ford's nursery. On this place Mr- Ford claims to have sowed the first bushel of wheat that was sown in Licking county. He carried the seed on his own back from the vicinity of Lancaster. From this bushel of seed he raised thirty-six bushels- of wheat, only five bushels of which were used for bread. The balance was sold to the settlers for seed. \"Here Thomas, the third child of Phineas and Mary Ford was born, August 1, 1802, and was probably the third white child born within the present limits of Licking county. There"], [612, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 60 2 are six other children of these hardy frontier parents, namely : Florilla, Cyntha Ann, Benjamin, Jane, Mary and Drusilla. These were born respectively in the years 1804, 1806, 1809, 1811, and 1814. \"Phineas Ford was a man somewhat eccentric in some re spects, but brave, self-relying and persevering; a good neighbor, a pleasant, social companion, a little reserved, but very affable and courteous in his manners towards others. In short, he was a good type of the New England gentleman, without his inquis itiveness, but was apt in his jokes and full of fun. He was a pretty good farmer and an ingenious mechanic, who could make anything he would undertake, or wanted for his own use, from a horse-shoe nail to a flouring mill with all its internal or ganism. He was full of resources to overcome difficulties, and, being a stranger to despondency, he possessed all the character istics of a first class pioneer. Mrs. Ford was a very skilful woman among the sick, and having taken lessons from Mrs. McCauley (the most skilful woman in the prctice of medicine, probably, in the country), she was a useful woman among the sick, and saved her neighbors many doctor's bills Her knee was dislocated by a fall from a horse, and by the unskilful man agement of a quack surgeon, she recovered with a stiff knee, which left her a cripple the last fifty years of her life. She died in the fall of 1863, in the eighty-seventh year of her age and the sixty-third year of her residence in Union township. \"Jonathan Benjamin, the father of Mrs. Ford, Mrs. Jones and Bennoni Benjamin, moved to Auter creek with his family in the spring of 1802, and settled on a fifty acre donation lot joining that of his son-in-law, Ford. This lot was first occupied by John Horned. There were several families of the Benjamins who moved from the Susquehanna in Pennsylvania in 1795, and settled at, or near, Marietta, but Jonathan was not one of them. He came there with his son-in-law, Ford, in 1798. Jonathan Benjamin was in some respects an extraordinary man. He was a person of rather coarse features, but of strong muscular powers, with a still stronger will. He was very determined in all of his undertakings, and of rather an unforgiving tempera ment. Having passed through the French and Indian wars, and through the war of the Revolution, and having suffered much and long by Indian depredations, both in the loss of friends and property, the finer feelings of his nature had be come blunted to such an extent that he seemed to have lost most of his sympathy for his fellow man. Still he was a man of religious habits, and of good morals, but was generally con sidered to be a man that was naturally morose and unsociable, and was not known through life to have expressed his forgive ness of the Indian race. He was not a reading man, hence what time he gave to social intercourse with his neighbors, was given to the relation of personal experience, or to business mat ters. He was a soldier, or frontiersman, most his life. It was not until he was about eighty years old that he consented to settle himself for the balance of his life. He bought in the woods and cleared up his last farm after he was seventy-eight years old. Notwithstanding this life of hardships, the iron con stitution of himself and his excellent wife sustained them to a great age. Mrs. Benjamin possessed social qualities that in a great measure compensated for the lack of them in her husband. They lived together as man and wife nearly eighty years, and raised a family of seven daughters and one son, all of whom lived to raise families of their own, and most of them large families. It is difficult to trace his family through all their meanderings, but Jonathan Benjamin was born in the year 1738, probably, in the State of New York. There is a family tradition lhat he was born, raised and married in New. York, then moved to Pennsylvania, and settled on the Susque hanna river, and from thence into Maryland, and from Mary land to Wheeling, Virginia, thence to Marietta, in 1798, and to Licking in 1802. Their appearance and dialect was of the Knickerbocker class of New York in former years, and they moved from either New York or New Jersey to Pennsylvania, soon after their marriage. There is no doubt among his friends that he entered the military service at the age of four teen years, and served through the war, but they cannot tell what war. It must have been some Indian campaign, as the French war did not commence for some two years later. He also served in the war of the Revolution, for which he drew a pension until his death ; and some or his grandchildren still have some continental money, which they claim was paid him for wages while in the army. He and his brother David with other men and their families, were in a fort on the Susquehanna in 1775, where he escaped from the Indians by being on the other side of the river with his family when the fort was taken. His brother and family were carried into captivity, and saved only their lives and the clothes on their backs. In the year 1802 he settled on a fifty acre lot of land that corners within a few rods of where Union Station now is. Here he remained until 1816, when he sold his land to James Holmes, jr., and bought again one mile further west, where he continued to reside till his death, at the age of one hundred and three years. In a conversation a short time before his death, he recapitulated his Indian history and sufferings. They were driven from their homes and their property burned three times, but the places where they suffered are forgotten. \"John Edwards was born in Baltimore county, Maryland, No vember 8, 1770. In the spring of 1798 he, with a small boy, with the necessary tools, knapsack and gun, crossed the Ohio river, into Jefferson county, in the Northwest territory, and es tablished a squatters right on Yellow creek, by erecting and fitting up a cabin for the reception of his little family, he and the lad living on wild game while building the house. When completed, he brought his family over from Virginia, to their new home in the wilderness, where they remained until the sum mer of 1801. A portion of the time while here he assisted the military as a spy, as the Indians were quite troublesome on some portions of the frontier at this time. In the fall of 1801, he moved into Union township, on the land of John VanBus kirk, with whom he had previously been acquainted. He was moved by George Wells, with a four horse team; Mr. Edwards went ahead of the team, selected and marked the way with his tomahawk, and killed a supply of game for their food. In the month of September, they drove up to the cabin of Phineas Ford, and stopped for dinner. Mrs. Ford prepared for their dinner some fried venison and johnny-cake, which she baked before the fire on a board, and a cup of sage tea. Mr. Ford was delighted with their call, and the whole party enjoyed the dinner, and the association as one of the happiest of their lives. John Edwards was a good neighbor, but there was a kind of decisive emphasis in his manner of speaking that grated harshly upon the sensitive nerves of some persons, and made them think him crabbed and unsocial. But this was a great mistake, for he was a great talker and enjoyed the social circle very much, and scarcely ever tired of telling and hearing hunting and other pioneer incidents. He died at the age of seventy seven."], [613, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 603 he often said he never could forgive the Indian race for the wrongs that he had suffered, still, when a friendly Indian called at his door for bread, he never would turn him away till he sup- plied his wants. But when this was done, he would at once request him to leave. He seemed to fear that the remembrance of his wrongs would overcome his feelings of humanity, hence he would not suffer them to remain where they would be likely to tempt him, or excite his feelings of revenge. For some cause he entirely laid aside the use of a gun, and for many years he kept none of his own. He raised a family of three sons and four daughters. \"Rev. Benedict Belt was born in Baltimore county, in the State of Maryland, January 30, 1785. His father died when he was a small child. When he was seventeen years old, he, with his mother, two brothers, two sisters and his brother-in-law, James Petticord, moved to the Licking valley in the spring of 1802, and Benedict, with his mother and Petticord, stopped on the banks of the North fork of Licking, where Newark now is. Benedict, having been raised in a mill, he and his brother- in-law erected a hand-mill on which they ground corn for toll. This proving rather a hard way to make a living they, by the aid of his mothers money, in the fall of 1802, erected a small log mill about one hundred feet from where the Van Buskirk or Montgomery mill now stands. This and a similar mill erected by Phinehas Ford on Auter creek in the summer of 1803. were doubtless the first two mills run by water within the bounds of Licking county; and probably the Belt mill preceded the Ford mill some six months. Soon after Benedict left his mill, per- haps in the spring of 1804, it was swept away by a flood, and the site was bought by John Van Buskirk, who built a better mill, and there has been a mill on that site ever since. The Ford mill, in a few years, shared the fate of the Belt mill, and was never rebuilt. Benedict Belt subsequently, with the family of his youngest son, moved into Union township, where he died, in July, 1863, in the seventy-ninth year of his age. He was a man of energy and aethity, but was a little given to im- patience and despondency when troubles assailed him. The evil consequences of this, however, were greatly overcome by the stability and sound judgment of his noble wife. He was a member of the Methodist Episcopal church about fifty-five years, and held a license as exhorter or preacher for more than fifty years. He was not a man of much preaching talent, but pos- sessed a great amount of religious fire and zeal. He was a fluent talker, and in some places quite popular and successful in calling sinners to repentance, and in building up the cause of Christianity in the wilderness. He was raised in the faith of the Friend Quakers; consequently he spoke as the spirit moved him, and was most eloquent when most excited. Few men have lived and died more respected foi their uniform piety and Christian integrity than Rev. Benedict Belt. He gave up his business matters to his son. but was active in his religious duties to the end of life. \"There wrere other preachers of those early days of the history of Union township that justly merit a respectful notice. \" Rev Benjamin Green was probably the first Baptist preacher that ever preached in the township. His labors doubtless laid the foundation for the \"Licking church,\" which has now been in successful labor as a Christian organization more than sixty years. Amos Park came here as a traveling preacher of the Methodist Episcopal church from Hampshire county, Virginia, and was a man of respectable preaching talents, and in his manners and \"David Benjamin was the son of David and Elizabeth Benja- min, and a nephew of Jonathan Benjamin. He was born on the Susquehanna river in Pennsylvania, in 1767; but, as was the case with Jonathan, the family records have all been burned by the Indians, and the exact date of his birth cannot be given. At this time the Indians were quite restless, and sought every opportunity to commit depredations upon frontiersmen. At the commencement of the Revolution, they had become so troublesome in that part ofthe country that several of the Benja- min families and a few others, tor mutual protection, had erected a block-house and a small fort, where they had kept their fami- lies for some time, they knowing that a band of Indians was lurking around them; but while thus combined and protected the Indians did not dare to attack them, and the whites sup- posed they had given the matter up and left. In this vain con- fidence, one pleasant Sunday morning in the month of May, 1775, they salliedfout to their respective cabins, to look at their gardens, etc. While thus divided, the Indians, who had been lying in ambush waiting for such an opportunity, rushed upon them and made prisoners of David Benjamin and his family, including his wife and six children, with some others. In this melee Jonathan Benjamin and his family escaped with their lives by being on the opposite side of the river. David Benja- min, feeling provoked at the thought of being taken prisoner before he was disarmed, raised his rifle and shot an Indian, who fell off the fence and was supposed to be killed. For this, a few minutes after, he was killed by an Indian with his toma- hawk, at a moment when he was not suspecting dangei. For this the chief expressed sorrow when he found his brother was not killed, but only had his arm broken. Our hero \u2014 David Benja- min, jr. \u2014 was the second eldest of this family of children taken prisoners, and who, with their mother, were hurried away into hopeless captivity, as soon as their houses were pillaged and burned. They were probably taken into western New York, as David's children say their grandmother often told them that they were close to the Canada line, but not in Canada. This family remained prisoners seven years, until the close of the war. One or two of the children having become so accustomed to Indian life, and nearly lost their knowledge of the English language, refused to return to civilized life; among whom was David's only sister, who, after she had married among the Indi- ans and had two children, was recaptured by the whites near the Niagara falls, but was so much dissatisfied with civilized life that she returned to the Indians, and was never again heard of by her friends. Among those who did return were David and two brothers, and their mother, who lived to a great age, and died in Hocking county, Ohio. After their return, they remained on the Susquehanna until David married, in the year 1795, when he, with his mother and one or more brothers, moved to the Northwest Territory, near the mouth of the Mus- kingum river. Here they remained about four years, when they moved about twenty miles from Marietta, probably in the northeast corner of Athens county. There they remained un- til May, 1805 or 1806, when they settled on the farm where Union station now stands, and where David died, on the sev- enteenth of July, 1834, aged sixty-seven years, and where his wife died in 1835, supposed to be sixty-eight years old. David Benjamin was a frontiersman all his life, and so much of his youth having been spent among savages, he grew up without education or much knowledge of the refinements of fashionable society, but he was a peaceable and kind-hearted citizen. He was cheerful, quite sociable, and very industrious.

He contin ued to preach until worn out with old age. \"Rev. George Callahan was another resident Methodist preacher of respectable talents who continued to preach for the people until age and afflictions compelled him to desist. He was born in the State of Maryland in the year 1766, and moved with his parents to Fayette county in the State of Pennsylvania, thence to Washington county, in the same State, where he mar ried and continued to live till the year 1809, when he settled in Union township. He filled the office of justice of the peace for several years. He worked hard on the farm through the week, preached for the people on Sunday, married the youth and buried the dead. He lost his wife in 1813, and married again in r8i8. He moved to Jersey township, where he died in the seventy-third year of his age. He suffered much from malarial diseases while on the South fork of Licking, and his system had become so much prostrated by it that he suffered with the third day ague through the last seven years of his life, without intermission, and died in the winter of 1839, respected by all that knew him, as an industrious and good man. He claimed to have been the first Methodist preacher that ever preached within the present bounds of the State of Ohio, and the time was 1785. While on the Ohio circuit he crossed the Ohio river and preached a few times at Carpenter's fort, where he had acquaintances. He had been a soldier in the war of the Revolution, and was a distinguished marksman with the rifle and an expert hunter of wild game. \"Rev. Elijah Scofield was a Dunkard preacher, who moved from the State of Maryland in 1810, and settled on Jonathan's creek, but traveled all oyer the western country, preaching wherever he could get a congregation. He preached and or ganized a society in Union township, soon after he came to the State. He was somewhat like Lorenzo Dow in being so much of a cosmopolite, but more like him in that he wore a long beard, which made him a conspicuous person in those days, when men were too proud to wear this distinguishing mark of their sex. \"Mr. D. J. Davis and his lady, who is the youngest daughter of the late Judge Henry Smith, have in their possession what is supposed to be the first frame table ever used in Licking coun ty, also a case of drawers, both said to have been made in Zanesville, and brought by Judge Smith when he moved to this county in 1803, or soon after. There was plenty of game all over this country when first set tled, and thrilling hunting incidents will be handed down in history for ages to come. But there was something peculiar in the origin and the character of the 'big hunts' which occurred in this township. About the beginning ot the present century a large landholder by the name of Backus had some fifteen hundred acres of land deadened preparatory to having it cleared. It was located in the northeast quarter of Harrison and the northwest quarter of Union township. The land was not cleared when the timber died, as was intended, but suffered to grow up with briars, thorns, grape vines, and a second growth of timber, until it became almost an impenetrable wil derness, and a great harbor for wild beasts of every variety common to this part of the country. The Bloody Run swamp a few miles to the south, and another to the west, called the Fallen Timber, where the forest had been prostrated by a tor nado, also afforded pretty safe retreats for the game to evade the skill of the hunters. The wolves and bears were sometimes so numerous and threatening that the hunters were compelled at night to surround their camps with, a circle of fire, or to erect a superstructure with poles in the forks of trees beyond the reach of the wolves, to secure their safety while they rested and slept. This deadening was situated nearer to the settle ments than were those other retreats, and sometimes these wild beasts accumulated in such great numbers at this point that the professional hunters could not afford a sufficient protection to the live stock of the farmers. At such times it became neces sarv for a general rally of all the pioneers to destioy or drive from the settlements these invading beasts. But for the pur pose of killing as many as possible, and to secure the safety of the hunters at these general rallyings, or 'big hunts,' a district of the country was surveyed and the lines well marked. The first was twelve miles in circumference, embracing the great deadening. The second, or inner line, was four miles in cir cumference, and a third but half a mile in diameter. This cen tered in an open valley on what was known as Grass Lick run. To this open valley the game was all driven that had not been killed or made its escape before reaching the third line. The hunters were formed in line on the first or outer line, from which they moved at a given signal, and on reaching the sec ond line they all halted until all had reached the line, and a second signal was given, when they again moved till they reached the third and last line; the people being thus prepared for a safe and systematic warfare upon these enemies to their prosperity. When the raids upon the pigs, calves and sheep of the farmers became frequent and destructive, then the 'big hunt' would be gotten up. This was done by calling a public meeting of the people of the several townships that suffered by their depredations, at which meeting they would elect their offi cers and appoint the day for the hunt. The command was usually given to some experienced military officer, with a suita ble number of subordinates. The hunters were all placed in a circle around the haunted district, on the first line, and were not allowed to move from the place assigned them until the concerted signal was given by the discharge of artillery at a given point, when they at once began to move from every point towards the center. Everybody that could carry a gun, or make a noise to help drive the game in, and would obey orders, was expected to be there. The movements were regulated by the officers, who rode along the lines to keep the men to their places. The number of men that attended these hunts was sometimes so great that by the time the circle was reduced to half a mile in diameter, it constituted a solid column all round. And when every part of the column moved with care and strictly obeyed orders, not even a wildcat or anything else could make its escape, except the turkeys and the deer. The former would fly over, and the latter, when they found them selves entirely surrounded, would pass through or over the lines, sometimes in large numbers; while carniverous animals would hide in the brush, hollow trees, etc. At a suitable point the line halted, and select hunters sent in to look up the game. When every hiding place had been carefully examined, the game was all brought in together, and the meat and peltries were divided among the different companies, when all would return home with feelings relieved from fear of any further depredations from that source for the next year, at least; for the destruction of wild beasts at these hunts was sometimes very great. The last hunt was in 1821 or 1822. \"The squirrel hunt was not so formidable in its character, but was sometimes quite interesting. There are but few persons"], [615, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 605 his innocence, secretly pursued him and watched him all night. He again started late in the morning, and traveled a less dis tance than it was agreed that she should travel the preceding night. One or two Indians again made their appearance, but now abandoned the pursuit, being satisfied of his innocence. The third day he reached the point that had been agreed upon as the place of their meeting. She had reached the place in safety the night before, but for fear the Indians might be still secretly pursuing them, she did not join the wagon of the trader until he was ready to start the next day. Mr. Zane, being on his way to the sea coast with a load of furs, aided her to the circle of her friends. During the whole time she remained a prisoner, she had received as kind treatment as could have been expected from such an uncultivated race of people. Her mis tress was very fond of \"firewater,\" and when drunk was a bloodthirsty tyrant; but her eldest son was a large and noble young chief, strictly temperate, religiously inclined, a warm and constant friend of the prisoner, whom he called his white mother, and from whom he often seemed pleased to receive re ligious instruction. This noble young chief would sometimes aid her to secrete herself, and supply her with food for two or three days at a time, during a drunken frolic of the Indians. Of this chief she would often speak in her old age, and would sometimes express a wish to see or know what became of her big Indian son, as she would sometimes call him. There was another lady, a fellow prisoner with her, who had been a slave in Virginia, but was very nearly white, who married an Indian chief by the name of Walker, soon after they were taken to Sandusky, and who became the mother of the learned, wealthy and celebrated Walker family among the Wyandots, at the time they left their reserve on the Sandusky, for their new home west of the Mississippi. Mrs. Walker lived to be nearly one hundred years old, and to enjoy the blessings of a Christian civilization, under the missionary instructions of James B. Fin ley and James Gillruth. Mrs. Walker was a warm friend and intimate associate of Mrs. McKeeveras long as she remained a prisoner, and from her the history of the twro lost daughters was obtained after the death of their mother. But the mother had passed through life without a knowledge of what had be come of them, and had mourned for them as being numbered with the dead.\" \"About two years after her return to the association of her friends, she married Samuel Park, the widowed husband of her deceased sister, with whom she lived until the eighteenth of February, 1815, when she was again left a widow. She had raised a family, by this last marriage, of six children of her own, besides six orphan children and one grandchild of her deceased sister. At the death of her husband, her eldest son, who had moved to the Licking valley in the year 1810, and settled on Auter creek, in Union towrnship, returned to Virginia and brought her to his home in this county, where she contin ued to live fourteen years, and until her death, on the fourteenth day of September, 1829, aged seventy-five years; dying within less than one hundred miles of the Indian tribe and the place where she had been a prisoner and a slave fifty years before, and within about two hundred miles of the residence of her two lost daughters, then the wives of two civilized Indian chiefs. but both of whom died near Detroit about the time their mother died in Union township. \"This woman of suffering and sorrow was my grandmother, and her son, who provided for her wants the last fourteen years of her life, was my father. She often spent her time in relating now living in this country that have any fair conception of the number of squirrels that once infested chis part of the country. When the wild fruits were scarce and they turned to the farm crops, they became a great burden to the farmers, and the squirrel hunt was gotten up as a self-defense. It was usually done by organizing rival companies, sometimes of different townships, and the prize was awarded to the company that killed the greatest number within the time agreed upon for hunting\u2014 usually one or two days. But few of the squirrels were saved for food by the hunters on these occasions, but the scalps were counted by the number of tails. The number killed at some of these hunts would seem incredible at the present day, but .they frequently amounted to several thousands. William T. Martin, in his history of Franklin county, gives the number killed at one hunt in that county, in 1822, at nineteen thousand six hundred and sixty, that were brought in, and that many of the hunters did not report at all. At the last hunt of the kind that took place between rival companies of Granville and Union townships, the number reported was a little over nineteen hun dred on a side. The hunt lasted one day and a half, and was reported on the afternoon of the second day. Nothing but the rifle was allowed to be used. The following personal history of one of the pioneers of this township can be best told in Mr. Park's own words: \"In the month of July, 1779, a party of Wyandot Indians, from the Sandusky rlvei, made their appearance in Greenbriar county, Virginia, and killed or took prisoners many of the white citizens, burning or destroying such property as they could not carry away with them. Among the sufferers was a family by the name of McKeever. The husband and father was shot down in his own door-yard, and the mother and three small children, the youngest but an infant of six months, were taken prisoners. Their house was pillaged and burned, and the pris oners hurried away toward the Indian headquarters on the San dusky river. The woman could in after years give but little idea of their line of travel, further than this: that the Indians, fearing pursuit, took the most direct route to Upper Sandusky. But in the year 1815, while moving to this State, when she reached the mouth of Licking river, she recognized that as the point where they crossed the Muskingum river, and whence they probably took the Indian trail up the valley north of New ark. Soon after reaching Upper Sandusky the youngest child died, and the other two, both girls, wrere taken from her to some place to her unknown. Here she remained a prisoner and a slave three years and nine months. Though the war had then closed, her friends did not seek for her as they supposed her dead, and the Indians, her masters, refused to give her up and let her return to her friends. In the spring of 1783. by the aid of an Indian trader by the name of Isaac Zane, she made her escape and got back to her friends, then in Hampshire county, Virginia. To successfully make her escape, she trav* eled for three successive nights on foot and alone, secreting herself in the wilderness in the day time. She had previously received instructions from Mr. Zane as to her line of travel, and where she should stop and await his arrival. To avoid any suspicion resting upon him as an accomplice in effecting her escape, the trader remained in the town the next day, until many of her pursuers had returned. He then started, but again stopped over night before reaching her hiding-place through the day. The Indians, not being fully satisfied as to"], [616, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 6o6 paper windows ; the chimney corners hung full of jerk ; the rich, juicy, fresh venison, broiled on the end of a sharp stick ; the noble wild turkey, roasted for Thanksgiving and Christmas ; the occasional feast upon a fat coon or opossum ; the johnny cake, baked on a board ; the rich and healthy coffee and tea, the product of the garden, the field and the forest, and made doubly palatable by rich cream and maple sugar.

But amidst these pleasant reflections there are some sad thoughts. These revered fathers and mothers have all passed away ; more than half of our youthful associates are numbered among the dead, and those that are left have lost the vigor and elasticity of youth and are blossoming for the grave. The school children of to-day greet us as grandparents, and we, too, must soon be numbered with the dead.\" It is pleasant to record the fact that Mr. Park is yet living in Marshall, Illinois. her experience among the Indians, and in teaching me the Wy andot dialect. She and David Benjamin would often, though prisoners with different tribes, relate to each other their suffer ings while among the Indians. \"Nancy A.

Her husband\u2014 my grandfather\u2014 was an English man by descent, whose ancestors were among the colonists of Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607-8. My maternal grandparents were from the county Antrim, in Ireland, and emigrated to this country at the close of the war of the Revolution. From this you will see that I, in my humble person, represent the blood of different nations, but it will not be supposed that my European predilections are very strong, as I have an American lineage of more than two hundred and fifty years. I was born in Union township, November 21, i8ro, and at four weeks old, in mid winter, was taken into a green beech cabin, without floor, door, or chimney, which, however, was soon made comfortable by the industry of my, then, young parents. Nor did I enjoy the lux ury of a nice baby-crib set on rockers. I was cradled in a sugar-trough, and often lulled to sleep by the notes of the owl and the howl of the wolf. But, even then, the sweeter song sters of the forest, such as the mocking bird, the nightingale and the whip-poor-will, sang just as sweetly from our wild forest surroundings, as they do now from the fancy groves of our finest villas. The attempt to resurrect and place upon record the history of our pioneer fathers and mothers, has caused me to live much of my life over again. The scenes and associ ations of my youth have many of them been brought vividly before my mind, as in other years.

THE Mound Builders left unmistakable evidence of their claim to be considered the pioneers of this township. There is a stone mound on an elevated point near the residence of Eli Smoots, two miles south of Utica. It is seventy -five feet in circumference at the base and fourteen feet high. The base, to the height of six feet, is com posed of earth, upon which is a layer of flat stone from two to twenty pounds in weight, which appear to have been gathered from the surface of the ground around the mound. This layer of stone fs about eight feet thick, and over it is a thin layer of decayed vegetable matter. Upon the side of this mound stands a maple tree two feet in di ameter. Some years ago some person dug a hole from apex to base without making any other discovery than evidences of fire at various points; but a sub"], [617, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 607 sequent party, beginning in this pit, about five feet below the surface, took out a few stones and ex humed portions of two skeletons, including por tions of the skulls and teeth. These fragments were placed in possession of Dr. Rogers, of Utica. Southeast of this point, on the same ridge, is a small mound of similar construction; and a quar ter of a mile further in the same direction, near the lake, is a common earth mound, originally twelve feet high, but now much reduced by culti vation. On a direct line with the above works, in the edge of Burlington, stands the circular earthwork mentioned in the history of that township. It ap pears to belong to , a chain of lookout posts, ex tending from the stone mound, which overlooks the broad valley of the Licking, to the great mound at Homer. The Indians had generally moved further north and west when this township was first settled, and the pioneers made the acquaintance of but few of them. The general feeling between the whites and Indians at that time was one of peace, with an oc casional exception among the pioneers of some who had suffered in the earlier Indian wars from their peculiar mode of warfare. There were a few whose deadly hatred could only leave them with their breath. To this cause may be attributed the tragedy of \"Squawtown,\" two miles east of Utica, in which McLean, Hughes (not Elias), and others played a game of cards to decide who should shoot a certain squaw.* The testimony in the court of justice pointed to McLean as the man who won the distinction. He was found guilty and sentenced to two years in the State prison. The best authority claims that he was pardoned a short time before the expiration of his sentence and died soon after, others claim ing that he died in prison. One more familiar with the family than any other living witness says he was pardoned, and before leaving prison an official said to him: \"McLean, you claim to be in nocent, tell us who the guitly party is?\" His an swer was: \"lam innocent, but I have suffered; one is enough to suffer, and I decline to tell.\" Topographically considered, the general surface is undulating; the southern boundary, except where it is pierced by the broad valley of the Licking, may be considered abrupt, but there is very little of it too steep for cultivation. It is well watered by the North and Lake forks of the Licking, and the numerous rivulets that go to make up those streams. There is a beautiful lake of clear water two miles south of Utica, near the bank of Lake fork, without an outlet; when full it covers nearly one hundred acres. A more particular reference to this lake will be found in the topographical chapter of this work. On the highlands oak abounds, but the township has been favored with a great variety of timber. The broad, rich bottoms, as well as the adjoining table-lands, abound in walnut, sugar, beech, syca more, buckeye and other varieties of hard wood. The soil, for all purposes, is hardly excelled in the county. Exact and reliable data regarding the very first settlers of this township have been very difficult of access. In September, 1805, Joseph Conard emigrated from Loudoun county, Virginia; and in the fall of 1806 settled in the southern part of Knox county, Ohio, near the line of Washington township, Lick ing county. He returned to Virginia, married Jane Butcher, and returned to his cabin home. In 1 808 he purchased a farm in this township of Dr. Jonas Stanbery, upon which he resided until his death, which occurred February 12, 1873, at tne age of nearly eighty-nine. If not the first settler he was among the first in the township. No claim appears that any one settled in the township before 1808. In 1809 Mr. Conard sunk some tan-vats near his house, and was connected with that busi ness at that spot up to the date of his death. He was a member of the Methodist church sixty-seven years. The Indians, he said, were his friends. He obtained his most trusty rifle of an Indian named Tusco. He christened it Tusco, and it became his constant companion; furnishing not only his own family with meat, but often his less fortunate neighbors. In one instance, knowing his minister's family to be out of meat, and meeting a favorable oppor tunity, he brought down a fine buck. This was on the Sabbath, and the next day half the carcass was sent to the minister, who, although he knew when \u25a0\"Reference is made to this in the chapteron the early pioneer1"], [618, "6o8 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. it was killed, the wants of a hungry family prompted him to call to mind the fact that the disciples plucked the ears of corn on the Sabbath, and he waived a critical scrutiny of the means through which the blessing came. He saw the ribs of the supposed mastadon taken from Major Robinson's mill-race in 1811. They were three in number and six feet long. Mr. Conard, before his death, to the best of his memory, placed the early settlers of this township about as follows: John Lee came in 1808, and during the years 1808-9-10, John Moore, William Blackburn, Patrick Moore, Nathaniel Kirkpatrick, William Robertson, Abel Wilson, Phillip Smoots, John Haas, John Mc- Knaughton and wife, and perhaps others, came. William Robertson and his brother James came to the present site of Utica in 1810. In 1808 Will iam came to Zanesville, purchased three lots and erected the first shingle-roofed house in that town. In 1810 the two brothers purchased the ground upon which Utica now stands, erected a cabin and log mill upon the site of the present mill, the mill wright work being done by that well known and somewhat eccentric Irish pioneer, James King. In January, i8r3, William returned to Franklin county, Pennsylvania, where he married in Febru ary, and he and his bride started on a bridal tour westward on horseback. They encountered swollen streams frequently, some of which they were compelled to cross in \"dug-outs,\"* swimming their horses behind the craft. They arrived at Judge Wilson's, now East Newark, March 2d, and the ladies being acquainted, they remained over night and part of the following day, spending the following night with Moses Moore. On the morn ing of the fourth they set out for their home in the wilderness, swimming their horses across the streams that intervene. When they arrived in sight of their cabin the Licking was yet to be crossed, and in at tempting this the lady's horse became entangled, either in flood-wood or floating ice, and in his efforts to disengage himself, threw his fair rider off. Fortunately she landed in an eddy at the foot of the tail race, and seizing a root, held on until her husband landed and fished her out with a long pole. What strength these pioneers must have had to endure a journey on horseback of three * Canoe made out of a log. hundred miles through such a wilderness as then existed. Isaac Vanousdall was among the earliest settlers in this section, but settled just over the line in Knox county; his history, however, is interwoven with that of the early pioneers of this township. He died February 28, 1873, in his eighty-sixth year. Jacob Sperry first visited Utica (then Wilming ton), in 181 1. In 1 81 3 he returned to Virginia and married, returning and settling here perma nently in 1815. He and his wife both died in the same week, in July, 1873, at the age of eighty-four and eighty-two respectively. Mrs. Rachel Penn, who died in September, 1874, came to this township in November, 181 1. In the notice of the death of this lady the Pioneer Record says: \"She was, at the time of her death, the oldest member of the Methodist church, in Utica. She was born in Maryland, March r6, 1788, and had, therefore, reached the age of eighty six years and six months. Mrs. Penn was the last survivor of twenty-five adult persons, who came to Ohio together from Maryland, sixty-three years ago.\" Her brothers Erasmus and Lemuel Jones came in 18 1 3. The house in which Mrs. Penn lived until her death yvas erected in that year. The first wedding in the township was, probably, that of Alban Warthen, and Elizabeth Vance, in February, i8ri; the second was, probably the double wedding of Joshua Berry and Mary Penn, and Elijah Ryan and Margaret Penn in 1812. John Conard was, probably, the first child born in the township. The first cabin school-house was erected about 1 814, on Major Robertson's land near the Kirk patrick line. Matthew Jamison taught the first school, followed by James Kirkland, William Cun ningham, William Derbin, and a Mr. Jewett. Mr. C. B. Giffin, in his paper on this township, thus describes a log school-house and school of his acquaintance. He says: \"I can describe a school of the date of 1820 to 1830 so accurately that my friends, Robertson, Penn, Moore, and others, will imagine themselves boys again, sitting in the shape of a figure four upon a backless bench, made by inserting round dog-wood poles in the rough sides of sawed or split slabs. The writing desks were of the same material, supported by the inevitable dog-wood pegs in the wall ; and above these desks a log was cut out and the leaves of last year's copy book, well greased with lard, placed over the aperture for the admission of"], [619, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 6oq light and exclusion of cold ; an old seven-plate stove, cast at the Mary Ann furnace, wish its elaborate ornamentation in bass-relief on the side; and over all, as the presiding genius of this institution of learning, seated upon a rickety, spavined old split-bottom chair, leaning against the wall for support, place Matthew Jamison or James Kirkland, with spectacles elevated on the forehead and a hickory gad leaning against the right shoulder. He awakens from his after-dinner nap to find the shcool slightly turbulent, and exclaims, 'Boys, mind your books,' then relapses again into the land of dreams, and woe betide the unlucky wight who disturbed him before he has satis fied exhausted nature. If this picture does not fit your locality, you need not travel ten miles to find the original of the picture. It is only by occasional comparison of the past with the pre sent that the present generation can appreciate their admirable opportunities. Look on the above picture and then visit your admirable union school, and you will bless the old fathers whose wisdom early devised and sustained a system of common schools that has grown with our growth, until the humblest in the land can now get an education, where formerly it could be had only by the favored few, who had means to send their chil dren abroad.\" Some of the old settlers of this township have a memory well stocked with reminiscences of old times, and especially do they take pleasure in re lating hunting and trapping stories, in which pas time nearly all the pioneers largely indulged. The following specimens regarding a wolf hunt and a bear hunt may be interesting in this connection. They are thus related by a participant: \"Joseph Nichols came to Stephen Miles one morning before breakfast with the information that a number of sheep had been killed by wolves, and asked Mr. Miles and another neighbor \u2014 John Nichols, to accompany him on a wolf hunt. They readily consented, and the trio set off with their guns and dogs to the rocky cliffs of Wakatomika, where the wolves were supposed to be hidding. After a search of some hours they discovered five voung ones on a cliff, but could find no trace of the old one. They concluded to lay in wait for the sheep eaters, and accordingly arranged the following plan; Mr. John Nichols was to take one of the young wolves up on the cliff and pinch it so that its cries might attract the older ones around the base of the cliff, and Messrs. Miles and Joseph Nichols were sta- tioned on another cliff where they could get good range with their rifles. Their plan was working nicely, and the young wolt was making the forest ring with its silvery tones when Mr. Nichols made the unpleasant discovery that two large open- mouthed wolves were bearing down upon him from tbe upper part of the cliff where they had been instead of in the valley below, as the hunters had supposed. Mr. Nichols quickly dropped his pet, and grasping his gun, unloaded it upon the foremost of his assailants, wounding it, but not fatally. They were gone in a moment, and could not be induced to return, although their howls during the night told the hunters that they were still in the neighborhood. \"Four of the young wolves were killed, and their scalps sold for five dollars each while the fifth was retained by Mr. John Nichols, and grew to be quite an interesting pet.\" The following adventure with a bear comes from the same source: \"While Stephen Miles and Adam Dush were strolling through the woods one day, their attention was called to a tree which they thought, was a bee-tree, as it had been scratched by bears in the attempts of that animal, as they supposed, to get at the honey. \"This opportuity to supply their tables with honey could not be overlooked; an axe was procured, and while Mr. Dush began chopping at the roots of the tree, Mr. Miles was watching the supposed bee-hole \u2014 the tree being very large and high. It proved to be a bear-tree instead of a bee-tree, and bruin seems always to thoroughly understand the nature of chopping atthe base of a tree in which he is located, and never waits to be violently thrown to the ground. Mr. Miles discovered a black bear rapidly descending the tree, and called to his companion to \"look out.\" As it came down, Mr. Dush struck it with his axe, but it sprang away, and ran in the direction of Mr. Miles' cabin, followed rapidly by the two hunters and the dog. As they ran past the cabin, a gun was procured, and the chase con tinued until, being worried by the dog, bruin climbed a tree, where he was shot by Mr. Dush just as he had reached the forks of the tree into which he settled, and from which he was dislodged by the use of a long pole. ' ' Mr. Dush was so overcome by his great exertions that he fainted, but was soon revived by his companion.\" Many similar stories are related by the pioneers, with a sigh that those good, old days are gone for ever. The first saw-mill was erected by William and James Robertson, in the spring of 1811, near the present site of \"saw-mill\"; and in the fall of the same year a log grist-mill was erected, and during the winter James King, a pioneer millwright, put in the works. These mills, notwithstanding the unusual misfortune of the washing away of the dams, met the wants of the community until 1815, when the present large frame mill was erected, which was considered a triumph of mechanical skill. It was framed by a Mr. Keller, from Owl creek, and when ready for raising was really a great undertaking, as indeed was the case with every building erected in an early day. This is but a fair specimen of all the frame buildings erected in those times, for dwellings, barns, mills, etc. Without any ropes or tackle, or any of the modern appliances of mechanics, these ponderous beams must be put in place by main strength. It required the combined power of one hundred and twenty-five men to raise this mill; and the head mechanic, wisely concluding that extreme care was necessary to avoid accident, solemnly decreed that no whiskey should be furnished, and with this"], [620, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 6io Robertson succeeded him in i8r5. The township has furnished the following public officers: Rob ert B. Truman, representative; William Bell, jr., sheriff three terms ; William Robertson, commis sioner from 1817 to 1820, and Richard Lamson, from 1820 to 1827; William Bell, jr., auditor three terms. Major Robertson was somewhat prominent among the pioneers. In addition to his civil offi ces, in which, as justice, he solemnized their marriages, and settled their disputes often without litigation, he, as a miller, furnished the staff of life, and when they died he made their coffins. Being naturally of a military turn he, at an early day, became major of a regiment that trained at Granville. On one occasion, after unavailing at tempts to cross a swollen stream, being washed ashore on the same bank from which he started, he was court-martialed and fined fifty dollars. Being a man of spirit he resented it, and imme diately organized a regiment at Utica. Patrick Moore was among the first to bring dry goods to this market, and Mrs. Robertson imme diately patronized him by buying a calico dress at ninety cents per yard. Elias Hughes, the first settler of this county was, for some years before his death, a resident of Utica, living with his son Jonathan. He died in Utica in 1844, at the age of ninety years, as nearly as could be ascertained. Jonathan is yet living at the age of eighty-four, and is emphatically the pioneer of the county. He is remembered as the salt-sack boy of 1798, an account of which is given in another chapter. Most ot those who settled around Utica during the earlier years of its history, had either emigrated from the north of Ireland, or were the descendants of those who had emigrated from that country. They were of Scotch-Irish descent. The term Scotch-Irish is applied to those whose forefathers resided in Scotland, but adopted Ireland as a place of residence, or emigrated to Ireland during some period of their history. The term designates a people who loved liberty and hated tyranny; who had been trained by trials, and made resolute by oppression, who seared God, and were governed by His word; who were staid, stable, and of a somewhat stern cast of Christian character. To this people admirable precaution the work went smoothly for ward to completion. It was something of an undertaking, too, to feed these hundred and twenty-five hungry pio neers. An ox had been slain the day previous, and this was served in the shape of pot-pie, after being cooked in several large eighteen gallon ket tles belonging to the lady of the house and her neighbors. Poultry was also abundant. By re moving the cabin and mill doors, and making use of every available flat surface, a table supported on stakes driven into the ground, was provided, and upon this the feast was spread, and there was enough for all. That frame still stands. When the mill was ready for work, it furnished the first flour shipped by the Ohio canal. Ten years later McNaughton's mill was erected, and these tyvo, with a saw-mill on Lake fork, were all the mills erected in the township. Utica, the only village in the township, was laid out by Major Robertson in 1815, and first called Wilmington. When they applied for a post office, about 1820, it became necessary to change the name, and Utica was adopted. Richard Lamson was the first postmaster. He was succeeded by General C. K. Warner, Jesse D. Arven, Edward Connelly, Clifford Elder, Michael Morris, George Smoots, William Cleermon and James Turner. The latter was appointed by President Filmore in 1852, and amid all the changes of parties, and the malignant feelings engendered by civil war, con tinued to discharge his duties to the satisfaction of all parties. Richard Lamson, or \"Esquire\" Lamson as he was familiarly known, was an influential man in the new town. He opened the first hotel, and it was in his bar-room that Mr. Messenger opened the first stock of dry goods ever brought to Utica. This village has but one principal street, on either side of which nearly all the business of the place is transacted. There are two hotels, a dozen or more stores and shops, a bank, and the various trades and professions are well represented. The only railroad touching the town or township is the Baltimore & Ohio. The fire department of Utica was organized in August, 1880. This township was organized in 181 2. Richard Lamson was the first justice of the peace; William"], [621, "HISTORY FO LICKING COUNTY. 6n Thomas and Joseph Scott and their wives, John and Mrs. Ross; Joseph, John, David, Patrick, and two Mrs. Moores : Teremiah and Mrs. Belt, Mrs. Woodrow, and John and Mrs. Connar. The five elders chosen at the organization were Patrick Moore, John Moore, Joseph and Thomas Scott and John Ross. Mr. Cunningham continued to supply the church about ten years, in connection with the church at Mary Ann. He was succeeded by Rev. Henry Hervey, D. D., who preached first in Utica on the fourth Sabbath of June, 1829. He was a gradu- ate of Jefferson college, and supplied the church at Utica five years, or until 1834, after which time his pastoral labors were confined to Martinsburg. During the time of his ministry in Utica, the church building, a frame structure that had stood several years not plastered, and otherwise unfin- ished, was furnished with seats and a pulpit. Dur- ing the same period, a Sabbath-school was organ- ized through the instrumentality of Mr. L. W. Knowlton. Rev. John Pitkin supplied the church about one year and a half after Dr. Hervey discontinued his regular ministrations here. He was succeeded for one year by Rev. Joseph Wiley. Rev. William Woods was the next supply. His term of ministe- rial service was brief, as he died after residing in the community about eight months. From 1839 to 1850, Rev. Isaac N. Shepherd was the pastor. Under his ministry the church increased consider- ably in numbers. A new church building was ( erected in 1847-8 \u2014 the one now occupied. Rev. J. M. Dinsmore was pastor from 1851 to 1854; Rev. Lemuel P. Bates from 1855 to 1858; Rev. N. Armstrong for six months from October, 1858; he was followed in 1861 by Rev. C. B. Downs and others. The following persons have been elders in this church : Patrick and John Moore, Joseph and Thomas Scott, John Ross, Allen Robinson, James Moore, David Gates, Robert Henderson, L. B. Stevens, Jacob Knisely, L. W. Knowlton, Dr. Jo- seph Rogers and J. C. Hemler. A Sabbath-school has been in existence nearly fifty years. The Reformed Presbyterian or Covenanter was one of the earliest societies formed in the town- ship. About 1809 James Dunlap and family, and to people of this character is America largely indebted for civil liberty, and the present character of its free institutions. High historical authority (Bancroft) says: \"The first public voice in America for dissolving all connection with Great Britain, came not from the Puritans of New England, the Dutch of New York, nor the planters of Virginia, but from the Scotch-Irish Presbyterians. \" The Methodists were probably the first to organize a church in this township, but its earlier history is involved in obscurity, as will be observed. The occasional preaching of Father Emmet, who was the first, or among the first to hold religious services in the township, resulted in the organization of a society in 1810, under authority of the conference, by Rev. J. B. Finley, also a pioneer preacher, and one of considerable note. The society was composed of Rev. Caleb Pum phery, John Green and James Smith, local preach ers, Jacob Hanger and Abram Kearns, class leaders, and thirty members. In the following year Rev. Elisha Bowman was sent from Kentucky to preach for them, and under his pastoral charge the society became divided on what was considered by the church authorities a new departure on the doctrine of the Trinity, and schism and discord followed, in terfering with the prospects of the infant society. In 18 1 2, Rev. Mr. Ellis became pastor and at tempted to amicably arrange the differences between the two factions, but found it such a difficult matter that he concluded to take a new start. He there fore destroyed the class-books, records and papers, and called upon all who wished to be Methodists to come forward and join the church. Success at tended his labors. He was succeeded by Revs. Samuel Knox, Jacob Hooper, Samuel Hamilton, Joseph Carper, Thomas Carr, Mr. Laen and El nathan Raymond, in about the order named. This congregation yet mantains a flourishing church and Sabbath-school in Utica. The Presbyterian church, of Utica, was organ ized October 5, 1818, and Rev. James Cunning ham was its first pastor. The original members were the following: Mrs. McCreary, James Cham bers and wife, John Dixon, Rebecca Dixon, Will iam and Mary Forsyth, Samuel and Isabella Shields, James Coulter, Cornelius Larue, Mrs. Hunter, Mrs. Cunningham, William Cunningham,"], [622, "6l2 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. Robert Kirkpatrick and his two sons, Nathaniel and Peter; Joseph Fulton, John McNaughton, Lemuel Kirkland, Joseph Campbell, John Camp bell, Samuel Duffield, and Joseph Jamison, the last seven with their families, settled here and formed themselves into a society for social wor ship. Rev. John Kell occasionally preached, and perhaps one or two others. In 1813 the church was regularly organized by the election and ordi nation of James Dunlap and Nathaniel Kirkpat rick ruling elders, who held the first meeting at the house of Robert Kirkpatrick, April s, 1814. Rqv. Robert Wallace, a licentiate, was called, or dained and settled over the congregation, number ing thirty-five or forty menbers, in the fall of 18 14. Mr. Wallace remained seven years and nine months, receiving considerable accessions to the church. In 1822 William Mitchell, afterwards representative in the legislature, was elected and ordained an elder. From 1822 to 1837 the church was without a regu lar pastor, relying upon supplies. As yet they had no house of worship, and held their meetings in a tent on a hill east of town, near the residence of J. M. Kirkpatrick. In 1830 a church edifice was erected, the house and lot costing seven hundred and fifty dollars. During the period of fifteen years, when the society was without a regular pastor, forty were added to the church, and Messrs. John McDaniel and Peter Kirkpatrick were added to the eldership. In r837 Rev. A. McFarland became pastor and remained until 1853. During this period one hundred were added to the church, and John Day, Hugh Harvey, William Adams, and James Har vey were among the elders. For three years the church was without a pastor, Rev. J. C. Boyd being installed in 1856. On the third Sabbath in Octo ber, 1864, the congregation worshipped for the first time in their new church, which cost three thousand six hundred dollars. A flourishing Sabbath-school is connected with this church. The society has always been anti-slavery; has witnessed the fruition of its hopes, and rejoices in prayers answered. A Baptist church stands on Lost run in this township, near the line of Newton. It was first organized in Newton township, at an early period, and a church edifice was erected in St. Louisville. This, in 1849, was s\u00b0ld t0 tne Christian church. Rev. John Fry was one of its early-time preachers. The church is built of logs, and the society was never large. The Christian Church, although not strictly a pioneer organization, dates its incipient beginnings back to the 'days of the schism in the Methodist church. In r835 an Episcopal organization was effected in Utica, by Rev. M. T. C. Wing, one of the pro fessors of Kenyon college. Its history is a short one and soon told. It did not live more than three or four years. During this period it enjoyed the ministrations, with more or less prosperity, of Revs. M. T. C. Wing, S. A. Bronson (now of Mansfield), H. Dyer, N. Badger, James Bonnar, and M. K Cushman; all of whom resided in Gambier, a dis tance of twelve miles, being connected with the col lege there. During the year 1837, when the parish was at its greatest prosperity, with a communion of twenty-one members, a commodious and com Le nient frame church was erected and finished. Un der a combination of depressing circumstances, however, it was not long used as a place of worship. Influential members of the small parish moving away, and the remainder being discouraged from further effort, and unable to lift the heavy mort gage on the building, it was sold, and is now used as a store or dwelling. The parish was never resuscitated. this church."], [623, "Biographical Sketches BY TOWNSHIPS\u2014 ALPHABETICALLY ARRANGED. FALLSBURY TOWNSHIP. Arnold, William L., farmer, post office, Perry ton.

On the thirtieth day os September, 1842, he was united in marriage with Mrs. Elizabeth Blaney, nee Phillips. Miss Phillips was born in Montgomeryshire county, Fregunnan parish, North Wales, on the twenty-fourth day of August, 181 1, and migrated to America in 1840, located in York State, remained one year, then, in 1841, came to Ohio, and located in Granville township, this county. The marriage ceremony was performed by Rev. Duncan, a Presbyterian minister of New ark. Mr. and Mrs. Ashley settled in Granville township, on a farm. They lived on rented farms for three years. In 1845 he purchased thirty-five acres of land, a part of the farm which he now owns, in Granville township, three miles from Granville, on the Newark road, on which they moved and have since resided. At present he owns a farm of one hundred and sixty acres of good land in Granville township, joining his first purchase. They reared a family of five children, viz: Mary, Edward, George, Martha, and William. Avery, Alfred, deceased, was born near New London, Connecticut, on the ninth of March, 1797. He was descended from an ancient and honorable family that settled early with the Massa chusetts colony.

He was but a mere lad when he supported his mother arid two sisters. A youth of fifteen, he served in the War of 1812. After the war he en gaged in the mercantile business, driving the cattle and hogs which he took for pay over the moun tains to Baltimore, and carrying provisions to New Orleans on flat-boats. Before the advent of rail roads he had crossed the Alleghany mountains eighty times, and when there were twenty-six States in the Union he had visited all of them on his own business.

Beardslee; they had seven children, all boys, as follows*. Julius C, George F., Henry C, William W., Burr W., Har mon R., and John A., all living but Julius C, who died of hemorrhage of the lungs, while in the army, at Shiloh, April 9, 1862. Nathan Bostwick went into the army at the breaking out of the war of the Rebellion, in 1861, taking with him two of his boys, Julius C. and George F. The latter was desperately wounded at Atlanta, July 22, 1864, by a cannister shot through the thigh, and with his father, fell into the hands of the enemy, and was taken to Andersonville prison pen. He had before been a piisoner for a month, and had been ex changed at Vicksburgh, having been captured in a sight with Wheeler's cavalry, near Middleburgh, Tennessee. He made his escape from Anderson ville in October, and hiding in swamps or bayous was pursued with bloodhounds, but finally secured a skiff and paddling down the Ocomulgee river, reached the Federal gunboats in safety. This young man suffered terribly from his wounds and prison life, a complete history of which would make an interesting volume. Nathan Bostwick went into the army as recruiting officer October 18, 1861, at Columbus, Ohio, with the rank of second lieutenant; was attached to company G, which was sent, with three other companies of the same regiment, to Warsaw, Kentucky, in January, 1862, where they settled some trouble between the Un ion men and rebels of that place. Company G remained in Warsaw until in February, when they returned to Cincinnati, and soon after joined the expedition against Fort Donelson, and was in the last day's battle at that place. After the battle company G\u201e Lieutenant Bostwick being then in command, escorted eleven hundred rebel prisoners to St. Louis, from which place, in company with a portion of company C, of the same regiment, they escorted all the officers captured at Fort Donel son to Camp Chase, at Columbus. Lieutenant Bostwick came home from this place, sick with typhoid fever, but his company went on to Boston with the field and staff of that capture. Upon his recovery from his very severe illness, he rejoined his company at Bolivar, Tennessee, in. June, 1862, and in September took command of company C, Twentieth regiment, with rank of first lieutenant. He continued in command of this company through the Vicksburgh campaign, the captain of company C having resigned. He was commissioned first lieu tenant May 9, 1862, and was with Grant during all the operations of the army for the capture of Vicksburgh ; the first battle of that campaign in which the regiment was engaged being at Thomp son's Hill, fought immediately after the battle of Grand Gulf. He was also in the battle of Ray mond and that of Jackson immediately following it; also the battle of Champion Hill, where he received a sun stroke, from which he yet suffers. The siege of Vicksburgh lasted forty-seven days, during which he was on duty almost incessantly, day and night, fighting and working in the trenches. After the surrender the Twentieth remained in camp until Sherman marched to Meridian Missis sippi, in February, 1864. Lieutenant Bostwick was promoted to captain, January 30, 1864, and transferred to the command of his old company, G, accompanying Sherman to Meridian. After that campaign, the regiment re-enlisted as veterans, and Captain Bostwick came home on veteran fur lough. The furlough having expired, the regiment rendezvoused at Cairo, Illinois, marching thence up the Tennessee river to Clifton, Tennessee, and over the Sand mountains, a distance of three hun dred miles, joining Sherman at Ackworth, Georgia, shortly after engaging in the siege and battle of Kenesaw Mountain. Captain Bostwick was in the charge made by his division at this place. The next desperate battle in which he was engaged was that before Atlanta, July 22, 1864, where his divis ion, under General Leggett, surrounded by Hood's forces was attacked in front and rear, and engaged in some of the hardest fighting of the war. Cap tain Bostwick says their division moved across their breastworks five times during the day, fight ing first on one side, then on the other. He was wounded twice in this action \u2014 with a sliver from a ball in the left eye, and a piece of shell in the left knee \u2014 and fell into the hands of the enemy. The brigade lost about one-half of its number in this bloody battle, in which it was frequently engaged in a hand-to-hand conflict. After his capture, Captain Bostwick was robbed of two hundred and thirty dollars in money, and most of his outer clothing, except his boots, which, being a fine, heavy pair, he refused to give up except with his life, and when a rebel captain approached for the purpose of taking them, he received such a kick in a vital part as sent him several feet distant, and nearly ended his life. Captain Bostwick expected to be riddled with rebel bullets for this act, as the guards were all around him, but, probably from admiration of his pluck, they did not molest him. The rebel officer, however, after regaining his breath and his feet, again approached him, with the intention, no doubt, of running him through with his sabre, but just before attempting the cow ardly act, he discovered a small Masonic emblem attached to the captain's waistcoat. This stopped him, and turning to the guards he ordered them to take the belligerent captain away. There is no doubt but that this mystic sign of Masonry saved his life at that time.

His father died in Danville in 1838. He came to Newark when he at Macon, Georgia, and subsequently to Charles ton, South Carolina, and placed in prison. He was again taken sick and remained for some time in the hospital, being treated by Dr. Todd, a rebel and brother of Mrs. Lincoln. From there he was taken to Columbia, South Carolina, October 6, 1864. Here he was outrageously treated, being sick with chills and fever and compelled to lie on the ground, without shelter or medical attention for three weeks, and came near dying, being re duced to a skeleton. He was then put into a tent hospital, and treated by a doctor named LaGrone, a Frenchman, from whom he-received much atten tion. December 1, 1864, he made his escape in company with Captain McFadden, of the Fifty seventh New York, and H. C. Payne, a sergeant of the Twentieth Illinois. They travelled twenty seven nights through the smoky mountains of North Carolina, travelling only in the dead of night, aided, fed and piloted on their way by the negroes, and reached our lines at Knoxville, Tennessee, December 27, 1864. Here he reported to Gener al Carter, provost marshal at that place, who or dered clothing for the starved and ragged prison ers, forwarding them to Chattanooga, and from thence to Nashville. After being ordered to vari ous places Captain Bostwick obtained a leave of absence and came home, remaining, however, only a short time, when he went by way of New York to join Sherman, then on the march to the sea. He was promoted major January 11, 1863, and joined Sherman and the Twentieth regiment at Goldsborough, North Carolina. After Lee's sur render he asked permission of his brigade com mander, General R. K. Scott, afterward governor of South Carolina, to resign, believing the war over; and his health being poor he wished to re turn home. His resignation being accepted, he came to Washington, settled with the Government, and was there at the time of the assassination of President Lincoln, after which he came home to his farm in Knox county. He subsequently sold his farm and spent some time traveling in the west; living a short time near Fredericktown, Ohio, Charleston, Illinois, and Mount Vernon, Ohio. In April, 1873, he settled in Newark, engaging in the drug business, where he yet remains. This brief biography, merely touches upon the military life of this gallant soldier. The story of his cap ture, prison life; sufferings, and subsequent escape, would make a very readable volume of many pages, and would verify the fact that \"truth is stranger than fiction.\" He tells of his continual but many times unsuccessful efforts to escape; of sickness, exposure, hunger, and the horrors of prison life; of his escape in a strange manner with two con federates; of their hiding in the swamps and mountains; of exposure and starvation; of being"], [641, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 631 was sixteen years old, and learned cabinet-making with his oldest brother.

Browne, the father of the subject of this sketch, was born in Philadelphia about half past three o'clock in the afternoon of July 4, 1776; probably the first born free American citizen. He was a merchant and manufacturer of gold and silver-ware, and began business with money bor rowed from the Franklin loan, a fund set apart by Benjamin Franklin to assist worthy and faithful apprentices in starting in business for themselves upon the completion of their apprenticeship. He was paymaster in the War of 181 2, was president of the council of Philadelphia for nine years, jus tice of the peace, and a political orator of note. The names of a few of the members of his house hold indicate a great change during the past cen tury.

Brice, Dr. John J., was one of the early settlers of Newark, and for many years was one of the best known citizens of our county and of central Ohio. His father (William Brice) was a native of Maryland, who, however, removed to Aexandria, Virginia, where he was engaged in the milling busi ness and in merchandizing at the time of his death, which occurred about the year 1786. He left a widow and five children, of which the subject of this sketch (born ini78i) was the youngest. Some years after the death of William Brice, his widow, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Adam Shock, of Co shoeton.

Brubaker, Mrs. Arabella, born in Licking township, January 6, 1818. She was the daugh ter of William C. Young, who came from Vir ginia to Licking county in the fall of 181 7. The customary way of traveling in those days was on horse back, and in this way Mr. Young brought his wife and all that he had, making two trips lor that purpose. He located on the farm now owned by H. Ronan, purchasing fifty acres of land. By industry and economy he had increased his farm to one hundred acres, at the time of his death, which occurred April 12, 1838, at the age of forty-four years. His wife died in August, 1877, aged eighty-four. The subject of this sketch was married to Abram P. Brubaker, April 7, 1836.

Browne, James M. \u2014 Mr. Browne's great-"], [643, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 633 with her five children, removed to western Penn sylvania, where her three daughters were married, and where she died in 1817. Her oldest son, Ben jamin J. Brice removed to Harrison county, western Virginia, where he married Sarah, daughter of Col onel Benjamin Wilson, reared a large family, and closed an unusually long, active and useful life. John J. Brice, by the judicious use of his patri mony, was enabled to acquire a good education, professional and otherwise. He studied medicine with Dr. Mowry of Pittsburgh, and it is said was a medical student, for a time in Uniontown, Penn sylvania. He also attended a course of medical lectures in Philadelphia, and was afterward associ ated in the practice of his profession with Dr. Mowry, his preceptor, who was a physician of much repute. Dr. Brice, however, soon decided to make a per manent location in the west, and with that view, travelled in that direction as far as Lawrenceburg, a small town on the banks of the Ohio river, below the mouth of the Big Miami, in the then Indiana territory. On his way back he travelled on horse back through Ohio, and took Newark in his route, where, tarrying for a short time, a great demand ex isted for his professional services, and he did not leave until the sickness which then prevailed both in town and country had, in a great measure, sub sided. This was in the autumn of 1805 (although it is elsewhere stated on the authority of Dr. J. N. Wilson, that it was probably in 1803), and about the beginning of winter he returned to Harrison coun ty, Virginia, where he, in January, 1806, consum mated a previously existing matrimonial engage ment with Anne, daughter of Colonel Benjamin Wilson, of said locality. He still intended to lo cate at Lawrenceburg, and came here shortly after his marriage, to close up his business, by collecting his accounts, and getting ready for the removal. But not being very successful in making collections, he, while thus engaged, was again drawn into prac tice, and it is quite likely that the longer he re mained the less probable it became that he would ever become a citizen of Indiana territory. Thus the summer of 1806 wore away, also the autumn and a portion of the winter succeeding, when in February, 1807, he brought his wife to Newark, she having until this time remained at her father's, where, on the thirtieth of November, she had given birth to her only son, Benjamin W. Brice, now a resident of Baltimore. The first house, or rather cabin, they occupied stood on the west side of First street, between Main and Church. Dr. Brice practiced his profession in Newark for nearly half a century, and his methods and merits as a physician are presented much at length in liberal quotations from the essay of the late Dr. J. N. Wilson on the diseases and mode of treatment, in early times in Newark and the Licking valley. It may be well to say in addition, that he was a faith ful, careful, judicious and successful practitioner \u2014 that in the vigor of life he possessed and exercised remarkable skill, care and judgment in his pro fession, backed by the accumulating and constantly increasing acquirements of a careful student, as well as rigid analysis and judicious deductions from all the notable cases coming under his treat ment. His talents, attainments and skill were recognized in high quarters, professional and non professional. Dr. Brice was an eminently practical man in the management of business matters, and it is not'surprising that one so energetic, industrious, and frugal, and of such sound judgment should have accumulated a large estate, so that at his death he was one of the wealthiest men in Licking countv. During the last twenty years of his life he was a member of the Presbyterian church, and died in December, 1853, aged seventy-two years. Brice, Mrs. Anne, wife of Dr. Brice, was a daughter of Colonel Benjamin Wilson, a gentleman of wealth and distinction of Harrison county, Vir ginia, and was born there January 17, 1786. She was married to Dr. John J. Brice in January, 1806, and became a resident of Newark, Ohio, in Febru ary, 1807. The beginning of her career here was specially marked by the cheerful resignation and almost heroic fortitude with which she embraced the new life in the west. Reared at her father's home in Virginia, in the midst of abundance, sur rounded with every necessary comfort, including a superfluity of house and other servants, never sub jected to cares or drudgery of any kind, she was transplanted from that comfortable home in mid winter, with an infant child in arms, a distance of one hundred and seventy miles, for the most part on horseback, through an almost utter wilderness country, to Newark, which was then but the mere beginning of a frontier village. Here she was dom iciled in the crudest of log cabins, where the ac customed comforts to which she was used were an impossibility, the means to supply the commonest wants and necessities, not always available. She had to assume the duties and cares of housekeep ing under all their embarrassments without the help of a single servant, and with little else to make her situation tolerable. Still, though sorely exer cised and grieved in mind by the prospect before her, she never thought of yielding to discourage ment, never indulged in repinings, but nerved her self to a cheerful acceptance of the situation, sus tained bv an unfaltering confidence that the ability, energy and industry of her young husband would command success, and that their many privations and hardships would be but short lived. That hope was not disappointed. Throughout her life she de-"], [644, "634 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. voted herself religiously to all her duties as wife, mother and friend, abounding always in sympa thetic interest for her neighbors, and ever benefi cently open-handed to help those about her who needed help. Mrs. Brice became a member of the Presbyterian church in 1833, and died in July, 1849, in the sixty-fourth year of her age. Brice, General Benjamin W. \u2014 General Brice was born in Harrison county, Virginia, November 30, 1806; and is the son of Dr. John J. Brice and Mrs. Anne Brice, who brought him to Newark in February, 1807. He attended the common schools of Newark, also the classical school taught by Rev. Thomas D. Baird, where he had for his as sociate pupils, Dr. J. N. Wilson, John Cunning ham, Elijah Stadden, James R. Stanbery and others. He and the last named were also fellow-students at Bishop Chase's school at Worthington, Ohio, as well as that of Philander Chase, jr., at Zanesville. Both entered the Ohio university, at Athens, Ohio, where the subject of this sketch was a sophomore, when, July 1, 1825, he was appointed a cadet at the United States military school at West Point, and where he was graduated July 1, 1829, and pro moted in the army brevet second lieutenant Third infantry. Cadet Brice, as appears from \"Cullom's Biographical Register of the officers and graduates of the United States military academy,\" (to which we are indebted for the military history of General Brice), served on frontier duty at Jefferson barracks in 1829-30, at Fort Armstrong, upper Mississippi, 1830-31, and on an expedition against the Sac and Fox Indians in 183 1 \u2014 this being the first Black Hawk campaign under General Gaines. He re signed in 1832 and engaged in merchandizing in Newark. He served as brigade major of Ohio militia from 1835 t0 1&39'> was admitted to the bar in 1845, and elected associate judge of the com mon pleas court of Licking county in the same year, serving two years; at the begining of the Mexican war in 1846 he was appointed adjutant general. On the third of March, 1847, General Brice was re-appointed in the United States army major of staff paymaster, and placed on duty in pay depart ment at Cincinnati the same year; and in service in the Mexican war at Carmago in 1847, and at Mon terey, Saltillo and Brazos Island in 1848, also at Fort Brown, Texas, in 1848-49; disbanded March 4, 1849, by limititation of law. General Brice was re-appointed in the United States army with rank of major staff paymaster February 9, 1852, and served in the pay department in the southern dis trict of New Mexico, with headquarters at Fort Fillmore, New Mexico, from 1852 to 1854. Dur ing 1854, '55 '56 his headquarters were at New Orleans, Louisiana, and from 1856 to 1859 at Fort Bliss (El Paso), in the southern district of New Mexico. He was also on special duty a por tion of 1859 in Florida. From 1859 to 1861 he served in the district of \"Kansas and the territo ries,\" his headquarters being Fort Leavenworth. General Brice remained in the service during the first year of the great Rebellion, serving as chief of the pay district of Kansas and the territories, and in 1862 was transferred to the district of Pennsylvania, embracing New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and West Virginia, with head quarters at Baltimore, Maryland, where he served as chief until 1864. On the fourth of October, 1864, he was placed at the head of the pay depart ment of the army at Washington city, District Columbia remaining in that position until January 1, 1872, when he was retired from active service at his own request, under the law of July, 17, 1862, hav ing passed the age of sixty-two years.

General B. W. Brice was brevetted March 13, 1865, major general of United States army for \"faithful, meritorious and distinguished services in the pay department during the Rebel lion.\" General B. W. Brice has entered his seven ty-fifth year, and with his accomplished and kindly remembered wife, is living leisurely in dignified retirement (ptium cum dignitate), in Baltimore, Mary land, not forgetting, however, to make occasional visits to Newark, Ohio, which he now regards, and has ever regarded, as his home, and where he is always certain of a cordial greeting by his many old-time congenial friends, and to which his urban ity, geniality, intelligence and fine conversational powers justly entitle him.

Clark, Mr. Anson. \u2014 The subject of this sketch was a native of Granville, Massachusetts, where he was born December 29, 1796, and came with his father's family to Granville (then in Fairfield county), Ohio, November 18, 1807, after a weary journey of forty-seven days, performed with ox teams, that being one of the methods of crossing the Alleghanies in \"the days of the pioneers.\" Mr. Clark acted well his part as a pioneer, as a citizen of the Commonwealth, as a Christian. He was a friend of freedom, of emancipation, of human liberty. Mr. Clark was theoretically and practically an ardent, zealous, consistent advocate of temperance, all his life, having joined the first temperance society organized west of the moun tains, more than fifty years ago, and was always faithful to the pledge then taken. His church membership dates back to 1828, and he ever after wards to the close of his life, sustained honorable church relations. Mr. Clark was an upright, intel ligent, industrious, honest man, and had endeared to him many sympathizing friends. He was dis tinguished for integrity of purpose, and for devo tion to the interests of the poor, the oppressed, and especially to the down-trodden, the crushed slaves. His influence was always exerted in behalf of what he esteemed to be truth, justice, right and good morals. The aim of his life was to make his conduct harmonize with the golden rule. The venerable pioneer died July 19, 1877, and was gathered to his fathers at the ripe age of eighty years, six months and twenty-two days. Clark, Hon. A. B. \u2014 Mr. A. B. Clark is the son of Anson Clark, and was born in Granville township July 11, 1825. He is essentially of New England origin, his father and mother both being born there, the former in Granville, Massachusetts, and the latter in Burlington, Vermont. In 1835 his father removed to Hartford township, and there gradually opened up a farm aided by the subject of this sketch, until he reached maturity, mean while enjoying the benefits of such schools as then existed in the remote township of this county. To these limited advantages were superadded, during the closing years of his minority, the privileges of a select school in the village of Hartford. In the meantime he constantly received valuable moral instruction from his father, who impressed upon his mind the infinite importance of a life of purity, honor and virtue, and of faith in Christianity. His father was not unmindful of the importance of the current periodical literature of the times, and fur nished his household weekly with the reading of the Oberlin Evangelist, the New York Tribune and the National Era. The library of the family was rather limited, and confined chiefly to the style of books of which \"Baxter's Saints' Rest,\" \"Pilgrims' Pro gress,\" \"Hervey's Meditations among the Tombs,\" and \"Allein's Call to Unconverted Sinners\" were fair representatives. This was a style of literature to which an ambitious youth and still less a full grown, young man could scarcely be expected to confine himself, and the subject of this sketch found his remedy in the free use of a tolerably ex tensive library owned by a neighbor and friend to whose generosity and kindness he was indebted for the opportunities it afforded of acquiring a wider range of information than were afforded by the home library, and it will probably be conceded by those who have made the acquaintance of the then young man of Hartford that he did not permit his opportunities to go unimproved. The desire for mental improvement and the acquisition of knowl edge, thus early indulged and cherished, soon be came a habit which he has not sought to change, but which has \"grown with his growth, and strengthened with his strength\" with each passing year. Mr. Clark entered October 1, 1846, into a life partnership with Miss Mary E. Durant, then a young lady fresh from the green hills of Vermont, whose father had settled in Hartford township. After his marriage he engaged in mercantile pur suits as well as in farming, and served for some years as a justice of the peace, signalizing his official term more as a neighborhood pacificator than by endeavors to mutliply the cases on his docket. He was trained in the school of the early Abolitionists, and was always ready to advocate their peculiar views, and more than willing to assist in giving force and effect, and if possible, success to their measures. Until 1848 he acted with the Abolition ists politicially, then and until 1856 with the Free soil party, and in 1836 and ever since with the Re publican party. With a taste for literature, and a natural bent for literary labor, he early fell into the habit of writing for the press ; it was therefore the most natural thing in the world that he should drift into the editorial chair. Accordingly, in the spring of 1868, he purchased an interest in the Newark American, and since that time, has done the principal editorial work on that paper; and that he is a writer of \"pith and point,\" all who are familiar with the American, will admit. Mr. Clark was postmaster of Newark for eight years, serving from 1869 to 1877; he was also the chosen standard bearer in 1880, of the Republican party, by unan imous nomination, in the Thirteenth Congres sional district of Ohio, and was supported by the full vote of his party. Mr. Clark is not only a writer of force and elegance, but also a public speaker of ability and power, and his contributions to the poetical literature of the day possess more than ordinary merit. And, most of all, it can be"], [657, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 647 said of his literary productions, whether poetry or prose, and whether on political topics, temperance, or whatever subject, that their tendency is to edi fication, to instruction, to enlightment, to mental improvement, to moral elevation. And no less true is this of his elocutionary efforts or public speeches and addresses. Cockran, Thomas, son of Joseph and Susan Cockran, was born April 22, 183 1, in Coshoeton county. He left his home when but sixteen years of age and went to Mt. Vernon, Knox county, and there learned the plastering trade. He re mained there about nine years, then removed to Delaware, Ohio, then to Ft.

Since coming to Newark, Mr. Crum has followed rail- roading as locomotive engineer. Curtis, General Samuel R. \u2014 Samuel R. Curtis lived in Licking county from 1807, the year of his birth, until 1826, when he was admitted as a cadet to West Point military academy. He had been for some time a clerk in the office of the clerk of the court. In 1831, he graduated; was appointed a lieutenant, but resigned his position in the army in 1832, and studied law and practiced his profession for some time. He was chief engineer in the construction of the dams and public works of the Muskingum, from 1837 to 1840, and after- wards superintended public works in Iowa and Missouri, and served under General Taylor in the Mexican war as a regimental commander and also acted as military governor of a number of towns in the valley of the Rio Grande. General Curtis was elected three times a member of Congress from Iowa ; but on the breaking out of the rebel- lion in 1861, he resigned his seat in Congress and became a major general in the Union army, in which he served with credit and honor. General Curtis was also chosen a member of the Peace congress, and held other honorable jiositions. He died at Council Bluffs, Iowa, December 25, 1866 in the sixtieth year of his age. Cunningham, Patrick, and others. \u2014 Patrick Cunningham was a Scotch-Irishman, born in the Province of Ulster. When quite a young man he emigrated to Maryland, and espousing the cause of his adopted country he served in the Revolution- ary war. A few years before his death, having met with reverses in fortune, he succeeded in ob- taining a pension from the United States govern- ment. He was an educated gentleman of the old school, very reticent in his disposition, particularly neat in his dress and person, and from his persist- ence in wearing gloves, knee breeches, and buck- els, was considered very eccentric by his pioneer neighbors. He was married three times, and died about the year 1835, and was, at the time of his death, supposed to be over eighty years of age. His first wife was killed by the upsetting of a sleigh. By her he had but two children, viz.: William and Thomas Cunningham. From his second marriage there were four children, viz: John, sr., Joseph, Ann and Polly. After the death of his second wife he again married, from which marriage there were no children. Cunningham, William, son of Patrick and father of John, jr., married Elizabeth Moore and with his family, consisting of his wife and one child (John, jr.), removed from Carlisle, Pennsyl vania, to Newark in 1811. He enlisted in Cap tain Spencer's rifle company and served in the War of 1 81 2; was present at Hull's surrender, and subsequently re-enlisting, died in camp at Franklinton, Franklin county, Ohio, in March, 1814. A letter written by this pioneer soldier upon a drum-head, by the light of a camp-fire, at the time of the surrender, and yet in the posses sion of his son, John Cunningham (who is now eighty years of age), is a fine specimen of compo sition and penmanship. Cunningham, Thomas, settled in Zanesville, where he reared a large family of children. Cunningham, John, sr., a son of Patrick by his second wife {nee Isabel Rainey), married Mary Elliott, a niece of Captain Elliott, of pioneer fame. He served as sheriff and auditor of Lick ing county, and justice of the peace for many years. Subsequently his son, John R., served a term as auditor. His family, consisting of his wife, two sons and two daughters and himself, have been dead for many years. The other chil dren of Patrick Cunningham having migrated west, but little is known as to their history. Cunningham, John, jr., son of William and grandson of Patrick, was born at Carlisle, Penn sylvania, September 16, 1800, and came to New ark with his parents in 181 1, both of whom dying in 18 14, he was left an orphan at the age of four teen. Among the pioneer teachers to whom he was indebted for his early . education were the names of Everson Blackburn, Amos H. Caffee, Rev. Thomas D. Baird, Hosmer Curtis and oth ers, whose names grace the annals of the pioneer history of Newark and of Licking county. Among those with whom he attended school were Henry B. Curtis, of Mt. Vernon, and Enoch Wilson, of Newark. A few others, perhaps, of Rev. Thomas D. Baird's scholars still survive. He learned the trade of tanner and currier, was for many years deputy sheriff and deputy auditor, and subse quently worked at his trade until ill health com pelled him to give it up. April 2, 1826, he mar ried Ann, daughter of David and Martha Lewis, and granddaughter of Deacon Theophilus Rees, who was born in Newark October 28, 1803, in a cabin on a hill upon the site of which the Park house now stands. Ill health compelling him to give up business since 1855, these pioneers have resided with their only son, W. M.

In 1874 he gave forth 'Craft Masonry, or Part First of the An cient York Rite,' i2mo. pp. 210. (The second part, 'Capitular Masonry;' third part, 'Cryptic Masonry,' and fourth part, 'Templar Masonry,' are now in press. \"The writer has seen in Newark, what is rarely exhibited in these degenerate days, three generations of Masons in the Cun ningham family, viz., the aged father, the subject of this sketch and his son. May the three limbs long stand unbroken, and afterwards be indissolubly united in the Celestial lodge above. \"Our sketch would be imperfect were not some references made to the secular life of Brother Cunningham. The book trade has occupied the greater part of his life. This was fol lowed by the insurance business, as agent, and in 1877 he re ceived the appointment as statistician to the Ohio department of State, to which laborious charge he was reappointed in 1879. The volume of Ohio statistics issued for 1877, which has re ceived commendatory remarks everywhere, was of his compila tion. A similar volume for 1878 is in press. As a handle of literary merit he received the grade of magistcr art turn \"But my space is exhausted. Were a page of 'the Masonic newspaper ' left for friendship, a eulogy would follow, both in prose and verse, that would demonstrate how much we all love William M. Cunningham who know him.'\" Sanford Cunningham, son of William M., died November 8, 1880, of consumption. He was an only child and much beloved. One of Newark's papers thus speaks of him : \"Few young men were more generally or more justly re spected and beloved than was Sanford Cunningham, and the memory of his broken, and yet in a true sense, complete life, will cling around his early tomb with a sweet fragrance. He was a young man of unusual energy, ability, and ambition, and had he been endowed with a physical constitution in pro portion to his mentality, he would have accomplished that dis tinguished career in life, of which his energy and ability gave such abundant promise. The heroism with which he battled for years with the insidious disease that was sapping his life was greater than the heroism of battle-fields, and yet he bore his sufferings with a patience and a resignation born of a calm, serene faith that never f.iiled him. Chords of sympathy, deep and heartfelt, thrill unbidden for the beteaved parents, and yet, onlv the God of all consolation can comfort such sorrow.\" NEWARK TOWNSHIP. Carson, Nancy. \u2014 Nancy Carson was long a well known citizen of Newark, where she died No vember 25, 1872, in the seventy-ninth year of her age. She was born in Washington county, Penn sylvania, May 17, 1794, and came with her father's family to Licking county in 1816. She was a most excellent pioneer, well adapted to life on the fron tiers; of rare industry, conscientiousness, and de votion to religious duties. Nancy Carson became a member of the Presbyterian church of Newark, November 13, 1816, during the ministry of Rev. Dr. Thomas D. Baird, and continued her mem bership there until her death, a period of fifty-six years, and always, while health permitted, attended its ministrations. Copley, Joseph. \u2014 He was born in Madison township, January 16, 1845; he is the son of John and Mary Copley. Mr. Copley was born Decem ber 25, 1798, in Yorkshire, England; he came to Licking county in 1842, and located in Madison these annual visitations no one is probably better known to the citizens of Newark than the subject of this sketch. Cunningham, William M. \u2014 The following re garding this gentleman appears in the Masonic Newspaper printed in New York in February, 1879: [The following sketch is from the pen of Brother Rob Morris, who has intimately known the subject of these remarks for a quarter of a century]. \"Brother Cunningham, now going through his second term of grand mastership, was born at Newark, Ohio, March 9, 1829, and is just completing his semi-centennial. Few of the craft have filled their fifty years of life in a more honorable and yet quiet and unobtrusive manner. Amongst masons, outside of his own jurisdiction he is best known as the writer of reports on foreigsi correspondence, a position which more than all others best develops the wisdom, strength, and beauty in the man. Many a man has worthily filled the highest grades of office, and filled them well, who could not write a readable re port on foreign correspondence. Of those due to the fecund and facile pen of Brother Cunningham, we find the best were composed for the grand lodge, but those for the grand chapter, grand council, and grand commandery, are well worthy of perusal. Were all gathered into a volume they would make a resume of the history of the order for the years that they cover. \" Brother Cunningham was initiated into Masonry in 1850, in Newark Lodge, No. 97, Newark, Ohio, and received the second and third grades the same year. Those of the chapter and council followed four years later ; the orders of the commandery in 1855. The almost interminable series of the Scotch rite oc cupied his time at intervals from 1856 to May 19, 1865, when he received the honorary grade of sovereign grand inspector general. \"The writer, in 1856, was the guest of Brother Cunningham, then a merchant in Newark, and, over an interval of several days, enjoyed the confidential chat of the young and studious brother, whose well filled library, and well filled mind and easy tongue, afforded all that could be desired of such an occasion. He predicted then (an easy task), the brilliant career which awaited Brother Cunningham, and he esteems it a special favor, twenty-three years later, to act as historian of his own (fulfilled) prophecy. Let us see it in a synopsis : \"Worshipful Master, of Newark Lodge, No. 7; High Priest of Warren Chapter, No. 6, Thrice Illustrious of Bigelow Coun cil, No. 7 (all at Newark); Thrice Potent of Enoch Lodge of Perfection (Columbus); Deputy Pui;siant Grand Master, 1863, and Puissiant Grand Master of the Grand Council R. and S. M., Ohio, 1864-5-6; District Grand Lecturer Grand Lodge, 1864-77; Grand Orator of Grand Lodge, 1874; Deputy Grand Master Grand Lodge oi Ohio, 1875 and 1876. Finally he ar rived at the highest honors known to Free Masonry, viz.: Grand Master of Ohio, in October, 1877, and re-elected in October, 1878. It is of record that his vote for the first term was seven-eighths, and for the second term, nine-tenths of the eight hundred votes of the delegation. His first annual ad dress, October, 1878, is a masterpiece and model for docu ments of the perspicacious yet forcible, brief yet comprehensive. In 1876 he had appealed from the decision of the Grand Master upon a constitutional question, which appeal was sus tained by the Grand Lodge, and thus the question of recog nizing the legality of colored Masons in Ohio was settled ad versely to the advocates of recognition. But Brother Cunningham is equally known as Masonic author and compiler. In 1865 he wrote a Funeral Book of Free Masonry, giving a complete set of forms for lodge, church, and cemetery service, and full instructions for Sorrow Lodges. This is the first work ever published upon that plan, and subse quent writers have borrowed from it so freely as almost to for feit its identity, yet the evidences exist. As author and compiler, the following list of works are accredited to our industrious friend: \"'The Manual of the Ancient and Accepted Rite,' 121110, pp. 272, Philadelphia, 1864, perhaps the first complete separate"], [661, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 65i township; he was married January 18, 1843; his first occupation was farming; he afterwards moved to Perry county and engaged in the woollen manu facturing business; moved back September 1, 1862, and died October 11, 1864.

Duke, Salathiel Allen, of Baxter, Drew county, Arkansas, was born in Bennington town ship, near Homer, Licking county, January 14, 1828. His parents were natives of \u2022 Virginia ; David Duke, his father, being a child of six years when his father, John Duke, moved from near Wheeling, Virginia, and settled near Zanesville, Ohio. This was about 1802. His mother's maiden name was Sarah Elizabeth Conard, whose father, Nathan Conard, was among the first settlers near Utica about the same time. This county was then inhabited by Indians; schools were almost unknown, and consequently the parents of Mr. S. A. Duke received but little education but endeavored to make up the loss by educating their children, and were always foremost in all educational in their neighborhood. In religion, his father was Calvinistic, his mother Quaker, but both became Methodists. In politics his father belonged to the Democratic party, and always went with his party. The son, however, was independent, thought for himself, and dates his opposition to the Democratic party from the repeal of the Missouri compromise. When the war broke out, Mr. Duke went to Helena, Arkansas, under authority of General Curtis, to organize a regiment of colored troops. A delay occurring, by reason of a change of department commanders, Mr. Duke was employed in finding homes in St. Louis for the thousands of contra bands that were then entering that city from the South. For this work he neither asked nor received any compensation. In the spring of 1863 he went to Helena, and there, under the direction of General Prentice, began the organization of a colored regiment. His work here was, however, interrupted, and he accompanied Adjutant General Lorenzo Thomas, who was then in the west for the purpose of looking after the interests of the colored people, down the Mississipi river; a plan having been devised for placing the contrabands upon abandoned plantations. Mr. Duke probably inaugu rated the first successful efforts in this direction ; and was placed in charge of what was known as the \" Out-post Plantation,\" two miles in rear of Good rich's Landing, Louisiana. Prior to taking charge of this plantation, it was through his instrumentality that four hundred bales of cotton were taken out of the clutches of thieves and delivered to the Government. After disposing of the abandoned cotton on his plantation, Mr. Duke, after paying"], [664, "654 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. all expenses out of the proceeds, was enabled to turn over to the Government sixty thousand dollars, which would have been lost or stolen but for his occupation of the plantation. He also started the first colored school in that section, being within the sound of Grant's cannon, at Vicksburgh, and was taught by a freed-woman. When the planting season ended, he gathered the negroes together in a fort the troops having departed from Goodrich's Landing, where a defence could be made in case of attack. Into this fort were collected during the winter some five thousand contrabands with all their possessions, to await, in the shelter of the fort, another planting season. The small-pox broke out among them, and Mr. Duke caused the erection of a hospital for the patients, near the gate of the fort, which fact probably prevented a rebel attack. In the fall of 1865, Mr. Duke settled in Arkansas, and still continues a resident of that State. In 1868, he was elected a member of the house, and in 1872 a member of the senate of Arkansas, on the Republican ticket. It was at this time that the well known trouble occurred between Baxter, the legally elected Republican governor, and Brooks. who contested his seat. A speck of war appeared in Arkansas, but Grant put his heavy hand on the contending parties, and the war was over. The Republican party was, however, and retired from power. Since that time, Mr. Duke has devoted his energies to building up his neigh borhood and bettering his condition. He now owns about three thousand acres of land, five hun dred acres of which is under cultivation, and all but sixty acres of this has been cleared in the last ten years. In 1849, Mr. Duke married Ruth E.

He also works at the carpenter trade. Hughes, Jonathan, retired farmer, post office, Utica, was born January 14, 1796, Thursday evening, eleven o'clock, in Harrison county, Vir ginia, and is one of the sons of Captain Elias Hughes, the great Indian hunter, scout and spy. His father removed with his family, in 1797, to Muskingum county, in a vessel made of a large pop lar tree, called a pirogue. It was large enough to lay a barrel across the boat lengthwise; part of their goods were sent on horseback. His mother rode a horse and carried him, and those of the family who .were able to walk did so. He was the eleventh child and the baby. Captain Hughes re mained in Zanesville until April 6, 1798, when he started for Licking county with his family. During their stay in Zanesville, Mrs. Hughes gave birth to a daughter, consequently there were three young children in the family ; the subject of this sketch being about two years old, a brother eighteen months older. The subject of this sketch and his brother, older, were placed each one in a salt sack, were hung over the pommel of the saddle and were carried to Bowling Green in that manner. They made the trip as fast as their geese would travel, as they drove them and had to cut a path through the woods. The Hughes and Ratliff families were the first white settlers that settled within the boundary of Licking county, and he is the only surviving member of either family. His father was ninety seven years old when he died; he was a soldier in the battle at Point Pleasant in 1774, and was not married until he was past twenty-five. They lived in Bowling Green ten years, when they moved upon North Fork, on a farm owned by Samuel Davis. In 1809 his father bought a farm, now owned by William Weiss, and, in the fall of 1813, gave it up. During the winter of 1808 and 1809, he attended school taught by his brother-in-law, James Maxwell, east of St. Louisville, a distance of six miles; he boarded with his sister; he attended school during the winter of 1810 and 181 1, and then was apprenticed to a carpenter and joiner in Mount Vernon, Knox county, in 1815. During his ap- prenticeship he received two months schooling in a school situate in the public square at Mount Ver- non; he remained there till the fall of 1816; was married to Lovina Davis, June 9, 1817. He car- ried on the carpenter business in Utica thirty years. When his father-in-law died, he purchased the in- terest of the heirs and moved to this farm, where he has since resided, farming and working at his trade until fifteen years ago, when he gave up his trade altogether. Mrs. Hughes was born June 14, 1800, and became the mother of five children; she died October 28, 1876. Her children are: Clarenda, born December 7, 1818; Louisa, born November 17, 1820; James M., born July 15, 1823; Vincent S., born March 31, 1827, and Ada- line N., born December 7, 1829. They are all married and are living in various parts o! the coun- try. After his wise's death, two of his granddaugh- ters kept house for him; they are the children of his son James, who lives in Indiana. He is an un- usually smart and intelligent man for one of his age, and has remarkable good health,and is able at this time of life to split his one hundred rails a day. On his eightieth birthday he cut and split one hundred and thirty rails in five hours and forty minutes, and walked fifty rods to his work, and came to his din- ner and returned within the time. He has five grandchildren married, and has ten great-grand- children ; his oldest great-grandchild is about twelve years of age, and his oldest grandchild is past forty. His father before him was a remarkably smart man in old age. When he was eighty years old he started from Utica after sunrise, and arrived at his daughter's, in Muskingum county, before sunset the same day, a distance of about forty miles; he re- mained with Jonathan from the spring of 1828 until the fall of 1844, when he died; he had been blind in one eye before he made the walk spoken of, but when he reached his daughter's, he found he was totally blind ; outside of that was in perfect health till the day of his death. He always had a deadly hatred of the Indian race. Although a great many Indian murders were laid to his door, there are but few of which any proof is known. At one time General Putnam was going to have him arrested, but through the agency of Colonel Ben Wilson and Colonel Elias Louths, General Putnam withdrew the order, as the Virginians thought everything of Captain Hughes, and they were afraid that if anything was done to him they would raise up and destroy the town of Marietta. At one time the Indians stole some horses belonging to him, Ratliff, Bland and Mr. Weedman. He, Ratliff, and Bland, started in pursuit. They overtook them, shot them, and re-"], [707, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 697 turned with the horses. About a year after, some Indians, friends of those that were shot, came to Ratliff's and demanded indemnity for those that were killed. Ratliff sent to Hughes a number of times, but he did not go, but finally he told his daughter Mary to go home and tell her father he would be over in the morning, and tell him, \"damn him, I will pay him.\" On his return, he told his wife that the Indians had gone, and he did not see him. Jonathan's mother was the mother of sixteen children; of whom fourteen lived to be men and women; she died in 1827. The subject of this sketch never drank whiskey, as a beverage, in his life, never tasted tobacco but once, and that was to cure a sore mouth, and never smoked a cigar, never voted the Democratic ticket, only at the time of the Jackson and Clay ticket, when he voted for Jackson. He is now a strong Prohibitionist. BENNINGTON TOWNSHIP. Iles, A. M., farmer. \u2014 His great grandfather, Henry Iles, was born in England in 1749; came to America during the Revolution.

While on the march- to the frontier, the regiment encamped a night at Delaware, and he was there for the first time stationed to do sentinel duty, with instructions to fire upon any man who at tempted to enter the encampment without giving the countersign. One of the commissioned offic ers, thinking it would be interesting to know how the boy, Jacob Myers, would perform sentinel, un dertook to pass the lines, thereby testing his fideli ty to his trust. Jacob hailed him the requisite number of times without getting any response, and the officer still advancing, he discharged his mus ket, severely wounding him. For this act he was court-martialed, but it being in proof that he had only obeyed orders, was acquitted. Many years afterwards a Methodist preacher was announced to preach, one day, in the old log church near which Jacob Myers lived, and, being a Methodist, he attended the service. The preach er, while in the pulpit, saw in Jacob Myers a coun tenance that was not utterly strange to him, and the latter thought the features of the preacher were those of a man with whom he was not wholly un familiar; but neither remembered the time, place, nor circumstances under which they had thus mu tually become familiarized to each other.

He rendered some military services during the War of 1 812, when a youth of only sixteen years. The medical profession having been chosen by him as his permanent pursuit, he entered the office of Dr. Anson Coleman, of Rochester, New York, as a medical student, and graduated at the New York Medical college in 1823. For four years after his graduation he was engaged in the practice of med- icine in Rochester, New York. Dr. Marble, in 1827, in company with Mr. Rufus Henry, settled in Newark, Ohio, and established the Newark Ga- zette, the latter being a practical printer, performing the duties of publisher, and the former doing the editorial work, and, meanwhile, engaging in the practice of his profession. This arrangement was continued nearly ten years, when Dr. Marble's practice became so extensive as to render it im- practicable to longer remain on the tripod, or per- form the duties and labors of editor. For thirty- eight years, and until his death, Dr. Marble was engaged actively, laboriously, extensively in the practice of medicine in Newark and the surround- ing country, the emoluments of which yielded him a handsome competency. Dr. Marble was an ed- itorial wtiter and essayist of ability, and a well- read, faithful, intelligent, judicious physician, who had the confidence of a large class of our citizens. His reading was not confined to politics and med- icine, but he had enjoyed the advantages of a course of reading of a much wider scope, embrac- ing history, literature, science, philosophy, morals. He was, therefore, a man of intellingence and gen- eral information. He gave his time, labor, and in- fluence, to advance educational interests, secular and religious, temperance and sound morals, and was a liberal and constant contributor to the church and her institutions. Dr. Marble was a man of great energy, of enterprise and industry, of frugality, of strong common sense views of life, and one of Newark's most public spirited citizens. He died October 24, 1865, in the sixty-eighth year of his age. Martin, George E., painter, was born in New- ark May 6, 1847.

Marvin, Ellen, was born in Brownsville, Pennsylvania, July 18, 1810. She moved to New- ark with her father, John McCaddon, in 1826; he was a soldier in the Revolutionary war; when he came to Newark, he bought three acres of land on which stands the house where Mrs. Marvin now lives. He died in 1846, aged eighty-eight years. She was married to Henry H. Marvin August 28, 1838. Mr. Marvin was born May 28, 1801. They have one son: William, born May 15, 1850.

They have two children: Bertha, born February 11, 1875; Charles W., born June 24, 1878. Milligan, Robert, retired, born in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, on the eighth day of June, 1800. In 1816 he accompanied his father's family to Ohio. They reached Zanesvile, Muskingum county, on the first day of January, 1817. In 1819 Mr. Milligan commenced working at the .cooper trade, and served two years as an apprentice ; then, in 182 1 or 1822, he began business for himself at his trade. In February, 1826, he was united in. marriage with Miss Catharine Hunt, a native of New Jersey, born March 3, 1802, and migrated to Muskingnm county, Ohio, about 1820. In No- vember, 1826, Mr. and Mrs. Milligan moved to Newark, Licking county, where he continued at his trade until in 1849, when he was appointed super- intendent of the Newark cemetery, which position he filled, faithfully discharging all duties devolving upon him until June, 1878, when he retired from business, and is now living a retired life, esteemed and respected by all that know him. In 1829 his companion was taken from him by death, leaving one daughter, viz.: Albina, who deceased, in 1834, of cholera. In October, 1831, he married Miss Mary Wilson, born March 7, 1810, daughter of Jacob Wilson. By this union he had four children: John W., Amanda Melvina, Sarah E., and Annie E.

Vernon, Ohio, September 3, 1836, and moved to Newark in the spring of 1857. His family has an ancient and honorable lineage, dating back over two hundred years in America, and ante- dating from its emigration to America into tradi- tional genealogy another century in Scotland. The Millers, of Scotland, were of Saxon origin, and followed the leadership of Edwin, who con- quered the Picts and founded Edinburgh, A. D. 449. The history of the family is rather obscure, until about the year 1600, when the country was distracted by civil war, assuming a religious char- acter between Catholicism and Protestantism. The Millers took sides with the Protestants, and later with the Presbyterians or Covenanters, when persecuted by James the First, in his efforts to es- tablish Episcopacy. The laws against Presbyter- ianism were so abitrary that it led to great disor- der and opposition by the inhabitants, and many personal encounters passed between the liberty loving Scots and the minions of the king, in the enforcement of obnoxious laws. The name of James Miller is found twice recorded in a list of those who paid fines for transgressing the laws in the city of Edinburgh, and is recorded in this quaint style : \"The compt of mony resauit in fra sick persones as hes transgrest aganest the statutis and ordenances of the guid toun; the namis of the persones that pay it, and the soum that evrie man pay it, and the occatione whair foir they pay it, be- giningat Mychelmas, 1608 yiers, till Mychelmas the yier of God, 1609 yiers, the time of thair offices of baill yiers, as follows: James Miller, for being found be the gaird, at twelve hours at even, with one sword drawin at James Harvie, \u00a34.

They set tled in Charlestown, near Boston, and joined the established Presbyterian church at that place. We find recorded in the Genealogical dictionary of the the first settlers of New England. \"James Miller, the Scotsman, Charlestown, admitted to First church, December 17, 1676, and made freeman May 23, 1677, and died July 14, 1690. His wife, Mary, joined church August 5, 1677, being baptized that day with her eight chilaren \u2014 James, Mary, Robert, Job, Abraham, Isaac, Mercy and Jane. The record of his father's death, August 1, 1688, calls him 'Sen,' an aged Scotsman above seventy.\" Isaac Miller, the son of James, removed to Concord, Massachusetts, and afterwards to Wor cester about the year 17 18. His son Isaac, born in Concord May 7, 1708, married in Worcester one Sarah Crosby, and reared a large family. In 1770, the year of the Boston massacre, he re moved to Dummerston, Vermont, which town he surveyed and settled. John, the son of Isaac, jr., was born in Worcester, December 20, 1756, and lived and died a farmer in Dummerston. His son, James, who was born in Dummerston, De cember 16, 1783, emigrated to Ohio in 1814, and settled in Knox county, what is now Miller township, named in his honor. His son, James Warner, bom in Dummerston, Vermont, July 8, 1807, settled first in Newark, about the year 1826, afterwards in Mt. Vernon, where he married in 1833, and raised a large family, the second son of which, Charles D. Miller, is the subject of this sketch. The genealogical order of the eight generations as far as authenticated, will then stand as follows: First, Sen Miller, born in Edinburgh, Scotland, about 161 3; second, James Miller, born in Edin burgh, Scotland, about 1640; third, Isaac Miller, born in Charlestown, Massachusetts, about 1670; fourth, Isaac Miller, jr., born in Concord, Massa chusetts, in 1708; fifth, John Miller, born in Wor cester, Massachusetts, in 1756; sixth, James Miller, born in Dummerston, Vermont, in 1783; seventh, James Warner Miller, born in Dummerston, Ver mont, in 1807; eighth, Charles Dana Miller, born in Mt. Vernon, Ohio, in 1836. In order to present the history of this family more in detail we. must return to the Scotish an cestors. Many of the Scotch Millers attained eminence in literature and science. The ancestors of Hugh Miller, the great geologist, were a seafaring race. Among the great writers were John Miller, of Lan arkshire, professor of law in the university of Glasgow; James Miller, of Ayr, physician and chemist, and editor of the fourth edition of the 36 Encyclopedia Britanica; James Miller, professor of surgery in the university of Edinburgh; Thomas Miller, of Glenlee, baron and lord justice clerk of court of sessions. The ancient coat of arms of this family, adopt ed by the various Scotch branches, bears a similar ity in the chief points of the field ; the only varia tions appearing in minor objects in the divisions according to the fancy of the bearer, or as conferred by heraldic law. The chief points, as borne by all the Scotch families, are: first, the color of the shield (white); second, the Moline cross, which represents the figure of the iron that supports the upper mill stone; third, the wavy bar in the base, and last, the mullet, or rowel of a spur. A de scription of the arms borne by the American branch of the family, as near as can be authenti cated, and as expressed in heraldic terms, is as follows: Argent, a cross moline, azure. In chief, second, bordure of three cinquefoils, gules, lozenge between two mullets; sinister chief lozenge be tween two mullets. In fessee, hand with first and second fingers extended, two arms with hands clasped, moline cross, sable, between four hearts; in base, wavy band of vert; crest, lion rampant with moline cross, sable, between paws; motto. Optima C\u0153lo, Unione Augetur. A very complete record has been preserved of the family of Isaac Miller, jr., the grandson and great-grandson of the Scotish emigrants. He was a staunch Republican in the troublesome times preceding the outbreak of the Revolution. Being a surveyor by profession, he became useful in the settlement of the then new country north of Mass achusetts, but his enterprises met with disaster through the machinations of the tools of the king, who had set a mark upon all Republicans. In 1763, he, with others, were granted a township of land in New Hampshire, which they settled and paid for, but by a subterfuge the British court, then in session in Worcester, re-granted it to General"], [736, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 726 two daughters, Elizabeth V. and Susan R.; John F. Miller and one son, Edwin S.; also Mrs. H. C. Bostwick, daughter of Madison Miller. James Warner, the eldest, was born in Vermont, July 8, 1807, and emigrated to Ohio with his father. In 1826 he came to Newark and engaged with his uncle, Willard Warner, who kept the old \"Green House,\" on the present site of the Park hotel. In 1830 he moved to Mt. Vernon and en gaged in business. In 1833 he married Mary G. Bryant, daughter of Gilman Bryant, esq., one of the pioneers of Knox county. He reared a family of ten children \u2014 James Bryant, Charles Dana, Elizabeth V., Edward Stanley, Sarah Warner, Philip Dennis, Mary Gilman, Francis Warner, Jennie Ella, and Susan R. James Warner Miller engaged in business in Mt. Vernon for over forty years, and was widely known as one of the most industrious and enterprising merchants. He re moved to Newark in the spring of 1879, where he now resides. This closes the succession of the paternal ances tors of Charles Dana Miller. His maternal ancestors were also of old revolu tionary stock. His mother, Mary Gilman Bryant, was the daughter of Gilman Bryant, a pioneer of Knox county, whose father, David Bryant, was an officer in the Revolution, and a cousin of William Cullen Bryant, the poet. David Bryant married Mary Gilman, the daughter of Colonel Jeremiah Gilman, in whose regiment (the New Hampshire line) he served. The genealogy of the New Hampshire Oilman's is thus narrated: In May, 1638, Edward Gilman, with his wife, three sons, two daughters and three servants, came from Norfolk county, England, in the ship called the \"Delight,\" of Ipswich, and settled in Hingham, Massachusetts. Moses, the third son of Edward Gilman, lived in New Market, New Hampshire, and had six sons Captain Jeremiah, born in 1660, had Thomas, Andrew, Joseph and others. The last two sons were captured by the Indians, in 1709, and taken to Canada. At a war dance, Joseph was burnt. Andrew was soldto the French, and imprisoned, but obtained favor of the governor and was permitted to work for wages until he earned a sum sufficient to purchase his freedom. He re turned to his old home, married, and had one son \u2014 Jeremiah \u2014 and three daughters. Jeremiah was born about the year 172 1. When the Revolution ary war broke out, he was commissioned a colonel and commanded a regiment in the New Hampshire line.

Marcy, Mrs. General George B. McClellan, and Mrs. Major W. B. Rossell, of the United States army. Sarah married Silas Wheeler, of Petersham. Tillotson emigrated to New York State. Pa tience married Dr. Thomas Amsden, of Petersham. Joseph was a soldier of the war of the Revolution, and served seven years with distinction, being pro moted to the rank of major, and merited the friend ship and confidence of General Washington. Isaac was a captain in the Revolution, and was badly wounded early in the war near Boston. Marshall was a farmer and left many descendants. John, the greatgrandfather of the subject of this sketch, was a Revolutionary soldier, and sub sequently became very prominent as a citizen of Vermont. Catharine married a Mr. Knapp and reared a large family. William, the youngest, was a soldier in the latter part of the Revolution and rose to the rank of major. John Miller, who was born in Worcester, Massa chusetts, December 20, 1756, had eight children \u2014 Lewis, James, Levi, Sally, Polly, Rosanna, Susan, and John B. Rosanna and Susan are still living \u2014 the former eighty-six and the latter eighty-four years of age. James Miller, who was born in Dummerston, Vermont, December 16, 1783, was educated at Williams college. In the War of 181 2 he was a member of the company of Captain Hayes \u2014 the father of President Hayes. He emigrated to Ohio in 1814, and was rix weeks making the jour ney in wagons. He bought of the government a section of land in what is now Miller township, Knox county, which was then a howling wilderness. James Miller was a gentleman of culture and high ly esteemed by his neighbors for his sterling worth, industry, and enterprise. He married Sarah War ner, the eldest sister of Luke K. Warner, of New ark. They were married in 1806, near Wards borough, Vermont, eight years before their de parture for the west. She was an accomplished and educated young lady, of rare personal beauty, and seemingly too tender for the hardships of pio neer life, but she lived to see the primeval forest on her husband's land replaced by smiling and fruitful fields. They reared a family of eleven children \u2014 James Warner, Madison, Volney, Henry H., Mary M., Rosanna W., John F., Harriet M., Sarah Warner, Dana, and Lucinda A.

Nicholas Gilman, who was a delegate to the con- vention in 1787, and signed the constitution of the United States, and the Hon. John Taylor Gilman, governor of New Hampshire, were descendants of Edward Gilman. Governor Lewis Cass was a de- scendant of Moses Gilman. Charles Dana Miller received a good academic education, which he greatly improved in after life by much reading and travel. He moved to New- ark in 1857 and engaged in business with Luke K Warner, doing a large and successful trade in the grain products of the county. When the war broke out in 1861 he enlisted as a private in Cap- tain Coman's company C, Seventy-sixth Ohio regi- ment, and was successively promoted for merito- rious services to first sergeant, sergeant major, first lieutenant and adjutant, captain and major by brevet. The latter rank was conferred by the Pres- ident of the United States. He was of light frame and delicate and. nervous temperament, seemingly ill adapted to endure the privations of a soldier's life, but in his case, as well as in many others, actu- al service proved that physical proportions and strength were fully counterbalanced by spirit and energy. During his whole term of service of three years and a month he never permitted himself to be excused from duty, although suffering physical disability, contracted by his devotion to the ser- vice. He was twice slightly wounded, at Vicks- burgh and Resaca, but continued on duty without reporting his wounds. He was engaged in the battles of Fort Donelson and Shiloh with credit, and during the Siege of Corinth, when the adju- tant of the regiment and adjutant general of the brigade succumbed to disease, he was detailed to perform their duties, at the same time he per- formed the arduous work as orderly of his compa- ny. It was here that his qualifications pointed the road to promotion, and his commanding officer, without solicitation, obtained a commission for him as adjutant of the regiment, to fill the vacancy of the late adjutant who had resigned. He con- tinued to perform the duties of adjutant for nearly two years, never missing a dress parade while with the regiment. In 1864, when the regiment re-en- listed as veterans he was promoted to a captaincy, and placed in command of his old company C. He commanded this company through the active and glorious Atlanta campaign, and in August, 1864, was appointed acting assistant inspector gen- eral, performing the laborious service pertaining to that office in a large brigade of nine regiments. Major Miller commanded the highest esteem and confidence of the colonel of his regiment. He was conspicuous for his devotion to the cause of the Union arms in battle and in camp. At Arkansas Post he was mentioned in special orders for his gallantry. At Atlanta, on the twenty- second of July, 1864, he led his company in ad- vance of the regiment, bearing the colors, and in the face of a scorching fire, drove the enemy from earthworks and re-captured a fine battery of parrot guns. He presented a conspicuous target in this en- gagement, but escaped the missiles aimed at him. His first lieutenant (Arnold) was shot three times by his side. At Ships Gap, while on the staff of Colonel Milo Smith, he directed the flank move- ment which resulted in the capture of two South Carolina companies. On the twenty-eighth of July, near Atlanta, he stood for four hours encouraging his men while breasting a fearful storm of musketry to which the regiment was subjected. The list of engagements he participated in numbers forty or fifty, but the principle battles and sieges which will be promi- nent in history, may be mentioned: Fort Donelson, Shiloh, Siege of Corinth, Chickasaw Bayou, Arkansas Post, Siege of Vicksburgh, Jackson, Dallas, Resaca, Kenesaw Mountain, Atlanta, July 22d and 28th, and Jonesborough. After the expiration of his term of service he re- ceived an honorable discharge, November 18, 1864. The war had practically ended in the west at that time. He returned to Newark and again engaged in his former business. In May, 1865, he married Lucy Gilman Jewett, daughter of David D. and Lucy Jewett, of New- ark. She was a noble woman, a devoted Christian, a fond wife and mother. This union, so promis- ing of long happiness, terminated in her early death, which occurred January 2, 1869, leaving two infant children \u2014 daughter and son \u2014 Lucy Jewett, born March 4, 1866, and Charles Dion, born November 17, 1867.

Was born in Perry township, January 31, 1845; \"ved there until 1864, when he enlisted in company F, One Hundred and Thirty-fifth Ohio volunteer in fanty; served eleven months; was taken prisoner at North Mountain, Virginia, and taken to Anderson ville, Georgia, where he remained seven months of the eleven, when he was sent home on parole. He was never exchanged, as the war closed shortly after. The treatment he received was very bad. His rations were one-half pint of corn meal a day. They were imprisoned in an open field with a stockade around it. The dead-line was about ten feet within the stockade; any prisoner attempting to pass this was liable to be shot by the guard. There was no shelter for the prisoners whatever, and for a bed they used the ground. There were sometimes an average of one hundred dead prison ers removed every morning. When he was paroled he went to Columbus, remaining in Perry township until the war closed, when he was mustered out of service at Camp Chase. He came to Newark, April, 1867, and was married to Mary E. Crow, ing the war, and although he has never aspired to civil office, he has been somewhat conspicuous in his advocacy of \"stalwart Republicanism.\" He has taken a lively interest in the organizations and re-unions of ex-soldiers, being one of the first pro jectors of. the Soldier's society of Licking county, through whose instrumentality the great re-union was held in 1878. Major Miller has been continuously elected secretary of the society. He prepared, and had published, the admirable report of the great' re-union which gives a very complete record of Licking county's participation in the war for the Union. Major Miller's early inclinations were decidedly toward the study of a profession instead of mer cantile pursuits. He inherited a taste for drawing and painting, and has followed the natural bent, more or less, in an amateur way, during his leisure moments. His eye is almost perfect in its compre hension of forms, distances and colors, with rare taste for landscape gardening, and rural adorn ment. He has been an industrious student of science and history, his mind favoring geological research more than any other. He has written many able articles for the press upon subjects in harmony with his tastes. In religion he was early brought up in the doc trines and faith of the Protestant Episcopal church, and became a member of that denomination be fore entering the army, but his general religious views are of the most liberal character, free from bigotry and disposed to reconcile and harmonize religion with science in its broadest sense.

With a gun in my hand, I stand thus alone. While my thoughts are wandering to the loved ones at home. Perhaps in their slumbers, they are dreaming of me, While I stand here on picket in old Tennessee. With my cartridge box on, filled with powder and lead, I stand winking and blinking and nodding my head. Now I rouse up again and rub hard my eyes, Peep out in the darkness to see rebel spies. Not a sound can I hear, not a soul can I see, There is nobody here but grim darkness and me. So I lean on mv gun, while my thoughts again roam To that circle of loved ones I left at my home. There's a father with locks that are growing quite gray, Who is anxiously thinking of his son far away. Not knowing how soon he may see that son's name, Among those who in battle were wounded or slain. Then there is mother, what a charm in that word ! What a thrill it creates whene'er it is heard; The counsels she gave loom up from afar, To shine in my pathway like some guiding star.\" Ross, Henry H., born on Shamony Hill cen tennial grounds, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, July 23, 1823, then the property of Judge Warner.

Isaac. \u2014 Isaac Smucker has been a resident of Newark fifty-five years. He was born in Shenandoah county, Virginia, Decem ber 14. 1807, lived in Somerset county, Pennsyl vania, from 1820 to 1825, when he moved to New ark. Here he has ever since been a resident, except a britf pei iod, from 1827 to 1829, which he spent principally in the Southern States. His first educational opportunities were in a German school taught by his father, who was a German, a native of one of the smaller German States. He subsequently attended ihe common school for some years, and was a student lor a year or two at the academy in Somerset, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile he had the benefit of some instruction in Latin, at the hand of a private tutor. Judge Jeremiah S, Black, the distinguished politician, lawyer and jurist, was one of his fellow-students at the asore said academy ; so also were Hon. John Y. GJass ner, editor for more than forty years of the Shield and Banner of Mansfield, Ohio, and Dr. William Elder, the eminent statistician and author, of Phil adelphia. In 1837-38 Mr. Smucker was elected a member of the State legislature, serving, as the Legislative journal shows, on ihe committee on the National road ; also, on a number of select committees, from which he made frequent reports. Among the most important measures he favored, as the journal shows, were the bill organizing the lunatic asylum, with Dr. Awl as superintendent ; also, the modification of the Common School law with Samuel Lewis as the State superintendent. Mr. Smucker was re-elected 'n 1838, and during the session of 1838-39 he served as chairman of the select committee on the geological survey of the State, and made, as appears from the official pro ceedings, an elaboiate report in favor of the con tinuance and completion of said survey. He also appears to have seived on the committee on unfin ished business, on the committee on roads and highways; also on a number of other com mittees. Mr. Snmcker not only voted in favor of a good school law, but subsequently showed his"], [780, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 77\u00b0 to this volume, in whole or in part. In the Natur alist's directory of 1879 he is represented as spe cially inteiested in arch\u00e6ology, geology and pale ontology. The politics of Mr. Smucker have led him to advocate human freedom, equal rights, and the perpetuity of the Union of the States ; his patriotism led him to oppose rebellion, secession, and the disiuption of our Government; his ethics or code of morals led him to oppose human s'av ery, wrong, and injustice, and to favor temper ance, virtue and universal education ; his system of christian philosophy (based upon the \"golden rule,\" and the \"Sermon on the Mount,\") naturally led him into individual and associated efforts that tended to ameliorate the condition of mankind ; his religion, non-sectarian and mildly dogmatic, has led him to favor all organizations, societies, asso ciations and institutions that promised the elevation and improvement of humanity, and the promotion and advancement of the interests and welfare of mankind; and it has also led him to be the zealous friend and constant advocate of a pure, elevating christian literature, and a christian pulpit and chris tian institutions that not only preceptively, but practically maintained the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. The ancestor of Mr. Smucker of the second generation before him ciossed the Atlantic in 1785, was at that time the father of five sons, all born in Hesse Darmstadt, and soon after he reached Ameri ca, settled in the Shenandoah valley. Three of those sons entered the Lutheran ministery, and one (George, the eldest) removed to Pennsylvania, be came distinguished in the pulpit during his minis try of more than half a century, and also as an author. His eldest son gave more than fifty years of faithful service to the same church, in the pul pit, and as a professor of theology and Biblical liter ature in the Theological seminary of the Lutheran church at Gettysburgh, Pennsylvania. In this capa city he held a high position, and acquired no small distinction as a scholar and Christian minis ter. He was also a voluminous author, giving to theology and philosophy the benefit of his labor as an author. A number of his sisters married Lutheran ministers, who also became college pro fessors or presidents of colleges, one of whom be ing Rev. Dr. Sprecher, president of the Witten berg college at Springfield, Onio. Five of his sons and sons-in-law also entered the Lutheran ministry, one of the sons, however, afterwards devoted him self to literary pursuits and authorship, having writ ten probably about thirty volumes, chiefly of a his torical character. Some of the descendants of one of the three preacher brothers (Nicholas), also entered the Lutheran ministry, and still remain in it. Many others of the numerous descendants of the patriarch appreciation of educational interests by executing that law as a school director, and as a member of the board of education of Newark, as appears from the Centennial volume entitled \"Historical Sketches of Ohio Public Schools,\" which shows that he served many years in those positions. The last civil office he held was that of Presidential elector in 1872. Mr. Smucker early required a literary taste, which he fostered by extensive read ing, and cultivated by frequent contributions to the newspapers and magazines of the day. The volumes of the \"Western Monthly Magazine\" con ducted by the late Judge James Hall, and pub lished in Cincinnati as early as 1835, show that he was then a contributor to its pages. He subse quently often found leisure to indulge in magazine writing, as appears from the columns of the \"La dies Repository,\" while edited by the late Bishop Clark, of Cincinnati; of the \"Historical Magazine,\" published in New York city, and edited by Hon. H. B. Dawson ; of the \"Historical Record,\" con ducted by Benson J. Lossing, LL. D., in Philadel phia, to which he contributed numerous papers, chiefly of a historical character ; of the \"American Monthly Magazine\" of Philadelphia ; of the \"Sci entific Monthly,\" and of various other periodical publications. There are also many pamphlets credited to him, a partial list of which appears in the \"Bibliography of Ohio,\" and which have been mentioned in the chapter on home authors, pam phleteers, and Magazine writers. He has also con tributed largely to the literature of most of the literary and scientific associations of which he is a member, among which might be named the \"Ohio State Arch\u00e6ological association,\" of which he is the president ; of the American Philological soci ety ; of the \"Newark Lyceum ;\" of the \"American Antiquarian society ;\" of the \"Association for the Advancement of Science ;\" of the \"Northwestern Historical society,\" of which he is vice-president, and of the \"Licking County Pioneer, Historical and Antiquarian society,\" whose secretary he has been since its organization in 1867, and for which he has written many elaborate historical papers, as will appear in this volume of said society. His historical and scientific papers have appeared in various magazines not here mentioned ; and many have appeared in newspapers during the present year, such as his description of the \"Flint Ridge,\" read before the \"Newark Lyceum ;\" his Lecture on \"Mineral coals,\" read before the Young Men's Christian Association of Newark; his papers in the last volume of \"Ohio Statistics on Cresap and Lo gan;\" and on \"Col.

It contains a few impromtu thoughts that were sug gested to him on the occasion of the celebration of the seventy-second anniversary of his birth (De cember 14, 1879), and were certainly in the memory of some of his niends to-day (December 14, 1880), on the anniversary of his seventy-third biithday: \" 'Tis little that the snows that melt, Are on his brow; 'Tis much the Psalmists limit is not felt A burden now. 'Tis little that he may not set at naught Great Nature's laws; 'Tis much that he has lived, and toiled and wrought In Freedom's cause. 'Tis little that the flashing fire of youth Burns dim to-day; 'Tis much that age brings wisdom; that in truth We live alway. Then let the years roll on; they cnnnot stay The heart's bright flame. Nor mar one leaf the wreath that truth shall lay On his good name.\" Smucker, C. Carroll, is a son of Hon. Isaac Smucker, of Newark, and was born there November, 1844.

William Stanbery, and was born in New York city, March 24, 1810, and brought to New ark the same year, seventy years ago. Mr. Stan bery enjoyed the opportunities of instruction afforded by the eaily time schools of Newaik. He was also a pupil in the grammar and Latin school taught by Rev. Thomas D. Baird, about the year 1818, and earlier. Subsequently he attended for a time, the classical school of Professor McMullen, in Granville, and of a similar school in Zanesville, taught by Professor Chase, son of the bishop. Afterwards he attended the school at Worthington, taught by the late Bishop Chase, where, among others, he had for his fellow student Salmon P. Chase, late Chief Justice of the United States. For the completion of his education his father placed him in the Ohio university, at Athens, of wh ch in stitution he is a graduate, having attained to a good rank in scholarship. After obtaining his diploma he entered the law office of Ewing & Hunter, of Lancaster, as a law student, and afterwards the office of Irwin & Stanbery, of the same place, where he remained until he had completed his law he found employment with his older brother, Hezekiah S. Sprague, the jeweler, who had settled in Newark a year or two before that time. He continued with his brother in that business until in 1840, when he commenced the study of law with George B. Smythe, attorney, and was ad mitted to the bar in September, 1842. He at once began the practice of his profession as one of the now well known firm of Smythe & Sprague, and soon became one of the prominent and suc cessful lawyers of Newark. Not having attended school after coming to Ohio, he is strictly a self educated man. He has been an earnest Whig or Republican from the lime he first had a vote, but has never sought political or official preferment, and still remains in the practice of his profession. In 1845 he married Miss Elizabeth Taylor, of Newark. She is a daughter of James M. Taylor, one of Licking county's pioneers. Mr. and Mrs. Sprague settled in Newark, where they have since resided.

S., jeweler, and dealer in gold and silver watches, clocks, jewelry, silverware, plated ware, Rockford watches a specialty; also all kinds of repairing neatly and promptly done, Palisade Row, west side of public square, Newark. Mr. Sprague was born in Otsego county, New York, December 8, 1800. In 1817 he commenced, as an apprentice, at the jewelry trade, in Providence, Rhode Island, and served three years as such. In Julv, 1820, he migrated to Ohio and located in Columbus, where he worked at his trade a few months with his brother, Lindol Sprague, a jeweler by trade. In November of the same year, he in coinpiny with his brother, Lindol, left Columbus on foot for Cleveland, expecting to engage in business at that place. They traveled by the way of Lancaster, Zanesville, Coshoeton, Millersburgh, Wooster, Medina, and from thence to Cleveland ; but not finding things looking favorable for them and their business, they returned to Wooster, where they engaged in their business as partners, and carried on a jewelry and silversmith shop nine years, when the partnership ceased.

He was admitted to the bar in 183 1. It has always been conceded that James R. Stanbery possessed intellectual endowments of the first order, and, as he had ample educational opportuni- ties, and also enjoyed the benefit of the legal in- struction of some of the ablest lawyers of Ohio, to say nothing of the legal knowledge obtained inci- dentally from his father, who held rank with the best old-time lawyers of the State, it is not at all surprising that he should have become a good law- yer, and have early taken a good position as a member of the legal fraternity of the county, and, indeed, of the State. For nearly fifty years Mr. Stanbery has been a practicing lawyer, and he has been little else than that, although engaged, more or less, in politics, and sometimes a candidate for office. In 1863 he was elected a member of the senate of Ohio, by the district, composed of the counties of Licking and Delaware, and served two years as such. He was also elected a Presidential elector in 1864, and cast the vote of this district for Abraham Lincoln for President of the United States. After this statement it is scarcely neces- sary to say that the subject of this sketch was patriotic, loyal to the government during all the dreary years of the \"great Rebellion,\" and no less the friend of freedom. Mr. Stanbery has much vigor and originality as a public speaker, and as a writer, is distinguished for elegance and point. He was postmaster of Newark from 1867 to 1869. Stater, B. F., railroad engineer, was born in Cumberland county, Pennsylvania, March iS. 1842. About the age of five years he moved to Berkeley county, Virginia, with his father. He was raised on a farm.

Tyler, Joel L, was born in Essex, Vermont. He is the son of Colonel George Tyler, one of the early settlers of Vermont, and is the youngest of a family of nine children. His father was a man of wealth and commanding position in society, and took an interest in the questions and enterprises of the day. Unfortunately he was induced by the confidence he had in others to become security for them, and whose notes when due, they failed to meet, fell upon him, the prompt discharge of which swept from him his entire fortune. Stripped in the middle period of life by the acts of others of the accumulations of a lifetime, and left with- out means, he determined to seek a new home in the wilds of the west, where land was cheap, and where amid new scenes he could forget the treach- ery of false friends. With his wife and two younger sons he came to Ohio and settled in Alexandria, in Licking county, without one dollar's worth of property, but conscious of having procured in all business transactions a spotless reputation as a man of integrity and honor. With no other advan- tages than those afforded by a common school, the subject of our sketch, with his brother, entered into the active duties of life determined to win back something of their fortune for the support and comfort of their parents in their declining years. By their united efforts they were soon in the possession of a farm of eighty acres, upon which they erected a home, in which their parents spent in quietude the remainder of their days. Seeing his parents comfortably situated, Mr. Tyler began life for himself. By the kindness of Mr. Phillips he was enabled to select a farm, and in a few years found himself in possession of money enough to purchase a farm for himself. He bought what is known as the Altoona farm, consisting of one hundred and forty acres, handsomely located . on Raccoon creek, in St. Albans township, in Licking county. Here he built for himself a home and by its careful improvement, he was gratified by receiving the first premium for the best improved farm in Licking county, from the Agricultural society in 1870, and again in 1874. In 1852 he was married to Lurinda Waterman, an estimable young lady of Alexandria, with whom he lived happily until the spring of 1863, when she was taken away, leaving to his care three small children, Cora, Edward and Fide, all of whom he has carefully raised. His daughters both graduated at the Ohio Wesleyan Female col- lege at Delaware, and his son, after spending a few years in college, adopted a business career. He is now of the firm of Tyler & Carlise, Cleveland, Ohio. In 1860 Mr. Tyler was appointed United States marshal by Colonel Selfred, of Cincinnati. He performed the work of taking the census of the county, with credit to himself and satisfaction to his employers. He was elected a member of the House of Representatives of the Sixty-third gen- eral assembly in 1877 by a majority of one thou- sand five hundred and three. After serving two years he was returned by about the same majority. Mr. Tyler has an eye for fine horses, and is seldom without a blooded animal and a swift goer in his possession. He is popular with his fellow mem- bers and wins the regard of all by his courteous demeanor and gentlemanly deportment, a man that Licking county may well take honest pride in as her representative.

The deceased could doubtless remember that all-impottan toccasion \u2014 but what vast and won derful changes have taken place since then! The simple recital of the primitive frontier life that the deceased then led, in common with all the pioneers, would fill volumes. But, doubtless, with all their disadvantages they had compensations. There was a strong and hardy manhood developed then, of which we have few traces now, and of which the deceased was so vigorous an example. Mr. White, early in life, married Miss Diana Owens, a young woman of much worth, of the neighborhood, by whom he had three sons, all of whom survive him.

After leaving school in 1831 he engaged as rod man with his brother, John White, in the con struction of the Hocking canal, through Fairfield, Hocking, and Athens counties, Ohio, which he fol lowed several years. In 1845 he took charge of the Ohio canal as chief engineer, which position he held until 185 1. He then engaged in the man ufacturing of brick, and supplied all the demands for brick in the town of Newark for a number of years. In 1854 he engaged in the livery business in Newark, which business he has since followed. In 1859, in connection with his livery, he engaged in the coal business, operating the Coal Port coal bank in Coshoeton county, boating the coal to Newark, and supplying all the calls for coal in the city of Newark about six years. In 1868 he con structed a bridge across the Scioto river, six hun dred and forty feet long, near Chillicothe, which took one year to complete. In October, 1875, he was elected commissioner of Licking county, and served one term. During his term of office he su perintended the building of the present court house. In 1841 he married Miss Sarah Drake, a native of Knox county. She was born in 1820. They settled in Newark, where they have since re sided. They reared a family of four children \u2014 Hanson, Angeline, Leander and Freddie. Ange line married C. F. W. Yergens, moved to New York city, where she died in 1874. Mr. White is the youngest child of a family of nine children, and is the only one of six brothers now living. His father, Samuel White, sr., settled in Newark in 1 8 10 and remained in this county until his death. Wilkin, R. B., son of Daniel and Barbara Wil kin, was born September 5, 1833, in the city of Newark, where he has lived ever since. Mr. Wil kin's father was one of the old settlers in the county, coming into it in 181 5. Mr. Wilkin is a he opened his branch office on the corner of Sec ond and Main streets, proving a step in the right direction. In the fall of 1879 he opened another office and yard on the corner of Second and Canal streets, at which place he has had a substantial platform erected to protect the coal from the ground. Having tried a number of different kinds of coal in this market, Mr. Wieant finds that the Bristol coal, from Perry county, gives by far the most general satisfaction, being equally adapted to house burning as well as for steam purposes. It is a sound, clean, free-burning coal, and is much sought after on account of its not being expensive. He keeps three of his own horses and carts con stantly engaged in delivering coal, sending out, upon an average, from fourteen to fifteen loads per day, though in winter often as high as thirty loads a day. Prompt attention is given to all orders. Welch, Lloyd, a farmer, was born in New Lis bon, Amoramo county, Maryland, January 13, 1816. His parents came to Hartford, Licking county, when he was fifteen years old. He was married to Sarah Warden, August 24, 1842, who was bora April 6, 182 1, and was a resident of Granville. Her parents came from Vermont, and were among the pioneers. After their marriage they moved to Monroe township, four miles from Johnstown; lived there fifteen years and then they moved to Sunbury; lived there about a year and then moved to Granville, and from there to West Newark, where they now reside. They had nine children \u2014 Mary Ann, born December 10, 1843; Arravesta, born November 29, 1845; Ellalora, born October 28, 1847; Henry, born January n, 1850. Silas, born September 8, 185 1; William, born March 29, 1853; Caroline, bom March 3, 1855 (deceased December 18, 1870); Martha, born July 7, 1856; and Albert, born December 29, 1861. They were all born in Monroe township but Albert, who was born in Sunbury. Mary, Ar ravesta, Henry, and William are married. Mary lives at Dunkirk, Hardin county, Ohio; Arravesta lives at Kirksville, Adams county, Missouri; Henry lives at Granville, Licking county, Ohio; and Wil liam lives in West Newark. The remainder of the family remain at home. Wells, Mrs. Fannie, was born in Newark, Oc tober 2, 1842. She is the daughter of Ira Abbott, who died at Newark in 1863, at the age of fifty years. Her mother lives on Main street, aged sixty-three years. Mrs. Wells was married No vember 27, 1861, to John James, of Newark He was born in London, England, November 27, 1838. She has one son, John Wallace, born November 9, 1862. Mr. James came to Newark at the age of nineteen years; he enlisted in company G, Forty fifth Ohio volunteer infantry, in August, 1862 ; he"], [809, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 799 carpenter and joiner by trade. When he was twenty-two years of age, he completed his trade with his father. He was married October, 1857, to Miss A. E. Phillips, of Newark. They have seven girls, the oldest of whom is a teacher in the public schools of Newark. Mr. Wilkin resides in the house where he was born on Fifth street. Williams, George, grocer, was born in Pennsyl- vania in 1837; moved to Jacktown in 1850; was married to Anna Beck September 1, 1860. She was born in Hebron May 15, 1841. They are the parents of eight children: Lucinda, born October 5, 1861; John, who died August 16, 1865, aged seven months; Lewis, who died March 8, 1876, aged ten years and eight months; Edward, born May 15, 1865; Harry, born January 5, 1870; Daisy M., born December 12, 1872; Katie, born December 14, 1875; George B., born December 27, 1878. Mr. Williams moved to Newark in September, 1875. He is carrying on grocery trade and city meat market. Williams, Aldridge, son of F. and K. Williams, was born July 22, 1829, in Fauquier county, Vir- ginia. He, with his parents, came to this county in 1837, and settled in Bowling Green township, where he resided until he was about twenty years of age, when he removed to Green county, remain- ing there about two years, when he returned to Licking county, and about three years after, he married Mary Dodd. She was born October 23, 1832. In 1869 they removed to Franklin county, remaining four years, when they returned to Lick- ing county, and have been here since. They have nine children: Jennie, born July 16, 1854; Ham- line, September 6, 1856; Ella, September 6, 1858; Belle, September 14, 1861; Byron, March 21, 1863; Anna, October 3, 1867; Daisy, March 12, 1869; David, January 27, 1872; Jessie, June 26, 1875; Jennie died April 16, 1873; Hamline died Sep- tember 3, 1859; Anna died January 8, 1872; David died when a babe. Mr. Williams resides on Granville street. Williams, A. H., proprietor of Licking county bindery and blank book manufactory, plain and ornamental binding done in good style, at reasona- ble rates. Mr. Williams' bindery is located on West Main street, in Felt's block, over C. D. My- ers' harness store. He has had twenty-two years experience in the business, and will warrant satis- faction given on all his work. Williams, George M., grocer and dealer in fresh meats, Woodbridge block, south side of the park. He was born in Westmoreland county, Pennsylvania, June 10, 1835, and in early life learned the carpenter trade, which he followed in that county until 1854, when he came to Ohio, lo- eating at West Wheeling, where he worked at his trade until 1859. He then came to Jacksontown, this county, where he continued in the carpenter business until 1859, when he engaged in the butchering, which he conducted until 1864, when he enlisted in company D, Tenth Ohio volunteer cavalry, in which he served until the close of the war, after which he returned to Jacksontown and resumed butchering, which he followed there un- til 1875. He then came to Newark, and con- ducted the business here until 1879, when he en- gaged in the grocery business in connection with butchering, since which he has been conducting both with good success. He occupies commodi- ous rooms, twenty by eighty feet, with a spacious basement, twenty by fifty feet, in which he carries a large first-class stock of staple and fancy gro- ceries, confectionery, queensware, glassware, wood and willow ware, stoneware, sugar-cured, smoked and pickled meats, dried and fresh meats of all kinds. He also conducts a meat market on the corner of Fourth and Main streets, where he keeps a large stock of all kinds of fresh and dried meats. Wilson Family. \u2014 The founder of this family in America was William Wilson, who was born in Ire- land, November 16, 1722. He was the son of David Wilson, of Ireland, who was the son of David Wilson, of Scotland. William came to America with a relative named White, about the age of fifteen years, settling near Winchester, Vir- ginia. He is found in the Shenandoah valley in 1744-5, where he married Margaret Blackburn in 1746. He was the progenitor of the Wilsons of the Shenandoah valley, and of most of those who subsequently settled in Licking county. Little is known of him after he settled on his lands locat- ed in what is now Hardy county, Virginia, except that he was industrious and prosperous, owning a good farm, a grist-mill, a distillery, blacksmith shop and \"weaving house,\" making his household some- what independent, after the custom of well-to-do farmers of that day. He resided here until his death in 1801; his widow survived him a few years, dying in December, 1806. Both were bur- ied on that portion of the farm owned by their son, Solomon, in a place near a church, in what was known as \"Wilson's graveyard.\" Their tomb- stones are still standing, together with that of their son, Moses, who died in infancy, in the year 1760; the inscriptions upon them being still perfectly legi- ble, as has been recently ascertained. The fol- lowing register gives the time of the birth and death of each of the sons and daughters of William and Elizabeth Wilson, one of whose sons (Archibald), with many grandchildren, settled in the valley of the Licking: Benjamin Wilson, born November 30, 1747, died December 2, 1827; Archibald Wil-"], [810, "800 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. son, born June 13, 1749, died March 27, 1814; David Wilson, bom September 8, 1751, died Au gust 12, 1805; William Wilson, born February 8, 1754, died January 1, 1851; John Wilson, born April 12, 1756, died April 12, 1827; Moses Wil son, born May 1, 1758, died February 7, 1760; Moses Wilson (second), born April 8, 1761, died April 7, 1784; James Wilson, born July 25, 1763, died August 13, 1822; Solomon Wilson, born July 2, 1766, died September 8, 1819; Elizabeth Wil son, born July 2, 1766, died March 20, 1849; Margaret Wilson, born April 7, 1769, died Septem ber 19, 1826. Wilson, Colonel Benjamin, was the oldest son and first born of William and Elizabeth Wilson. He was born November 30, 1747, in that portion of Frederick county, Virginia, which is now in cluded in Shenandoah county. The county of Frederick, at the time of Benjamin Wilson's birth, was bounded on the east by the Blue ridge, on the west by the western boundary of the State, and embraced most of the northern portion of the Shenandoah valley, extending nearly a hundred miles southwardly from the Potomac, its northern boundary. In 1772 the southern portion of Fred erick county was formed into the county of Dun more, named in honor of Lord Dunmore, then governor of the colony of Virginia. The governor taking the side of England against the colonists, in the opening year of the Revolution, became exceed ingly unpopular with the Virginians. Fearing their vengeance he fled from the city of Williamsburgh and took refuge on the British fleet in the harbor of Norfolk, in August, 1775, and on the first day of the year 1776 he ordered the bombardment of the town by said fleet, which resulted in the destruction of the greater part of the business por tion of Norfolk. By way of retaliation for his act of barbarity, the legislature of 1777 changed the name of Dunmore county to Shenandoah, which it still retains. Within its present limits, as before stated, the subject of this sketch was born. But little is known of Benjamin Wilson during his minority, except that he made himself useful to his father, on his farm on \"Trout run,\" sometimes as a miller, again as a distiller, then again as a gen eral farm laborer. Educational facilities were quite limited in the new settlement in which he grew in to manhood, but Benjamin Wilson made good use of his leisure hours, by dedicating them to studies which fitted him for a prosperous business career. These he pursued eagerly by the firelight of the mill and distillery, as well as by the lamplight and pine knot light of the farm house. From the family record we find that he entered into the married relation with Anne Ruddell on the fourth of September, 1770. Soon after his mar- riage we find him a resident of Tygart's valley, west of the Alleghany mountains, in what is now Ran dolph county, West Virginia. An incident in his life on the frontiers, by way of illustrating the hard ships and perils of the pioneers among the Alle ghanies, is not without interest, and will bear relat ing in this connection. While making a horseback journey over the Alleghany mountains in winter, the weather suddenly durning very cold, and the ground being covered with snow, so retarded his speed as to throw him much behind time in reaching his desti nation. He was following a path in which the snow was probably not much broken, and when it became dark he was still some miles distant from the mountaineer's cabin in which he intended to spend the night. But seeing safety in perseverance only, he pushed along until he became so much be numbed from the cold as to almost lose conscious ness, and dropped into the condition of drowsiness which usually precedes death by freezing. Soon sleepiness overcame him, and, yielding to his feel ings, he got off his horse, and, taking the sheep skin on which he rode, with him, placing it upon the snow he laid down with it under his head After being in this perilous condition a few mo ments, having dropped asleep, he dreamed that his life was in danger from a pack of wolves, and that they were then pulling the sheep-skin from under his head. This frightful dream so thoroughly aroused him that he suddenly sprang to his feet to defend himself against the wolves, but hearing or seeing none he at once realized his condition, and how narrowly he escaped death in the woods that night by freezing. He, therefore, by an almost su perhuman effort, sprang upon his horse and pushed forward on his lonely path until he reached his destination, where a large fire, a warm supper, and a good sleep fully restored him. Thus was a val uable life providentially preserved for many years of activity and usefulness. Benjamin Wilson served as a lieutenant in the Dunmore war, as it was called, which was an expe dition against the Indians in 1774. While negotia tions with the Indians were going on at Camp Charlotte, now near Westfall, Pickaway county, Ohio, Lieutenant Wilson served as aide to Lord Dunmore, the commander in chief; and it is not unlikely that he held the same position until the army was disbanded. He is said to have \"ac quired by his zeal and attention to duty, the confi dence of his superior officers.\" Early in the Revolution Lieutenant Wilson was appointed a captain in the Virginia forces, and rendered essential services, principally on the fron tiers. During the war he was the organ through which most of the military and civil business of"], [811, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 80 1 the part of the State in which he resided was transacted. Captain Wilson frequently served as commander of forces suddenly raised to pursue marauding parties of Indians, who had made incursions into the settlements on the frontiers, and had stolen the horses, burned the cabins and murdered the helpless women and children of the settlers in the wilderness, or carried them into captivity. In De- cember, 1777, the Indians, in considerable force, entered the upper extremity of Tygart's valley, and killed Darby Connoly and his wife and three children, and John Stewart and his wife and child, besides making prisoners of four members of those families. With great promptitude Captain Wilson raised the requisite number of men, who took the trail and pushed forward in pursuit of the savages. He also commanded the volunteers raised to pursue the Indians that murdered and scalped Lieutenant John White in Tygart's valley, -in the following year. In these expeditions Cap- tain Benjamin Wilson was prompt, influential, and conspicuously courageous, as well as prudent and judicious. The late Elias Hughes, the first settler of Lick- ing county, was frequently in the pursuing parties under command of Captain Wilson, and always bore testimony to his good sense, sound judg- ment, skill and bravery. Captain Wilson's valuable services and distin- guished abilities secured him a colonel's commis- sion in 1781. Colonel Wilson was a member of the legislature of Virginia from Monongalia, several sessions, previous to the year 1784, in which year the county of Harrison was established, and at the organization of the county he became the clerk of the county court. The duties of this office did not, however, withdraw him entirely from the theater of politics, although he retained it very many years, even well along until near the close of his long life. Colonel Wilson was elected and served as a delegate in the convention of Virginia in 1788, which ratified the Constitution of the United States. In politics he was a Federalist, and was one of the acknowledged leaders of the Federal party in western Virginia, until after the close of the War of 181 2, when party lines were oblitera- ted, party names abolished, and parties them- selves dissolved, the consummation being the elec- tion of Colonel James Monroe to the Presidency of the United States, whose administration for eight years (two terms) was sustained by almost the entire people, without distinction of party. In 1802 Colonel Wilson purchased of John Rathbone a four thousand two hundred and eigh- teen acre tract of land, being a quarter township of two and a half miles square, and designated on the surveys as the northeast quarter, section one, township two, and range twelve, of United States military lands. This eventuated in a sort of family purchase, whether so intended or not, for it is au thentically ascertained that twenty families, that were the descendants of William Wilson, have lived upon this celebrated \"Wilson section,\" the southern boundary of which was within a few rods of the northern out-lots of Newark. Among the Wilsons who settled upon it were three of the children of Colonel Wilson, viz: Cornelius, Elizabeth (Mrs. Martin), and General Thomas W. Wilson, now deceased. Mrs. Ann Brice, Dr. Noah L. Wilson, Mrs. Julia Robinson, and Mr. Daniel D. Wilson are four other children of Colonel Wilson who settled in Licking county, the two latter being still residents. Colonel Wilson's wife died after a married life of nearly a quarter of a century, having given birth to twelve children. He thereupon formed a sec ond matrimonial alliance on the fifteenth of De cember, 1795, with Phebe Davidson, who became the mother of sixteen children, making twenty eight by the two marriages, twenty-four of whom reached adult age. Twenty-four of the twenty eight children of Colonel Wilson were living at the time of his death, which occurred December 2, 1827, two days after he had cldsed the eightieth year of his useful, honored, eventful life. Not only honors, but wealth came to him in profusion, so that he made liberal provision for-bis large family of children. The posterity of Colonel Wilson, liv ing at the time of his death, consisted of twenty four children, seventy-three grandchildren, and one great-great-grandchild, making a total of one hundred and thirty-six! And the number has been greatly augmented since. The names of Colonel Wilson's children are as follows, given in the order of their birth: Mary, born July 9, 1771; William, January 23, 1773; Stephen, October 21, 1775; Ben jamin, June 13, 1778; Sarah, September 11, 1780; Ann, January 17, 1786; John, July 5, 1788; Arch ibald, July 25, 1790; Cornelius, April 7, 1795. In addition to these three others were born who died in infancy, and all were children of the first wife. The children of the second wife were : Josiah, born October 12, 1796; David, February 18, 1798; Edith, November 9, 1799; Elizabeth, October 18, 1801 ; Thomas W., May 12, 1803; Margaret, March 26, 1805; Deborah, October 17, 1806; James, June 9, 1808; Daniel, January 30, 1810; Phebe, August 29, 181 1 ; Martha, January 23, 1813; Phillip, June 29, 1814; Noah L, March 9, 1816; Julia Ann, September 28, 181 7; Harriet, November 13, 1818, and Rachel, July 20, 1820. Of these children two died in Licking county, viz.: Ann, wife ofthe late Dr. John J. Brice, and mother of General B. W"], [812, "802 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. Brice, late paymaster general in the United States army, and Elizabeth, wife of the late William Mar tin. Colonel Benjamin Wilson was a man of affairs, of extensive information, of large experience, of keen observation, of genial temper, of mild dispo sition, of much knowledge of human nature and of the world, of excellent conversational powers, of sound judgment and good sense, of most dig nified bearing, of stately deportment, of stalwart person, of vigorous intellect, of courage, energy, enterprise, of generosity and hospitality, of the adventurous daring becoming a frontiersman, of undoubted patriotism, of unimpeached and unim peachable integrity of character, of fine address, of commanding presence, of high toned morality, and of the elegance of manners that characterized the true \"Virginia gentleman of the old school,\" which he was. In 1810 the late Hon. William Stanbery spent a number of days in Clarksburgh, at the residence of Colonel Wilson, who had then reached the full maturity of his intellect, the dig nity that characterized him in his more advanced years, and the elegant manners for which he was so distinguished. The young and accomplished Ohio lawyer, having letters to Colonel Wilson, soon made his acquaintance, and in a late conversation the writer had with him, he remarked that in dignity, address, appearance and manners, Colonel Wilson reminded him more of General Washing ton than any person he had ever seen. It is well also to observe of Colonel Wilson that he was not unmindful of the claims of religion upon him, but sustained, to the close of his life, an irreproachable Christian character, and by precept, and not less by his example, exerted a large influence in behalf of Christianity. Being an influential leader among those who formed public opinion, it is readily in ferred that the interests of sound morality, and of religion were greatly the gainers from his life and example, and correspondingly the losers by his death. Wilson, Archibald, was the second son of William Wilson, and was the oldest brother of Colonel Benjamin Wilson, the subject of the pre ceding sketch. He was born in the Shenandoah valley, near Winchester, Virginia, on the thirteenth of June, 1749. Comparatively little is known of his early life. There is now a book in the posses sion of his youngest, and only surviving, son (Enoch), entitled \"Cocherel's Arithmetic,\" which bears an English imprint. Upon the blank leaf of this centenarian family relic is found this record, claimed to be in Archibald Wilson's hand writing: \"Archibald Wilson, his book, bought of James Cam. Doud, at his store on Old street, in Winches ter, August 14, 1 77 1, I say bought by me, Archi- bald Wilson.\" This fact brought to view in the early life of the subject of this brief sketch raises the presumption, at least, that at the above date, when he was twenty-two years of age, he had got so far along in his studies as arithmetic. His edu- cation, like that of most of the young men of his day, in that then frontier country, was most likely obtained in an irregular, piece-meal man- ner, and by no means thorough \u2014 rather \"picked- up\" than systematically acquired. As Archibald Wilson was a farmer to the close of his life, it is highly probable that he spent the years of his minority upon his father's farm, assisting in farm work principally. In 1774 Archibald Wilson joined the Dunmore army, and proceeded with it on the famous expedition against the Indian towns on the Scioto. At Camp Charlotte, near the Scioto, Dunmore attempted to unite all the Indians in a treaty, but the Mingos declined, so a force of about three hundred men was organized and placed under the command of Major Crawford (who was afterwards burnt on the Sandusky plains by the Indians), to destroy one of their villages up the Scioto, and to otherwise chastise them for their obstinacy. Archibald Wilson was in this expedi- tion. He says that few Indians were to be seen when they arrived at the Mingo village, one war- rior and a squaw, however, were shot and a few prisoners taken. While in the pursuit of the savages he endeavored to capture an Indian boy who, however, was on the alert, and for some time dodged his pursuer in the woods. Under the ex- citement of the chase Archibald raised his toma- hawk to strike him, but fortunately, before the blow was madej the young savage sprang into a tree-top, lying upon the ground, when he was easily cap tured. It was in after years, and to the close of his life, a matter of rejoicing with Archibald Wil- son that he had done no injury to the Indian boy. This scene \"came off\" near where is now the vil lage of Franklinton, in Franklin county. The killing of the squaw, who was not a beligerent, was an un-soldier-like, brutal act, but it was alleged to have been unintentional. She was killed by a shot fired by a man named Vance, who, at first sight, took her to be a warrior. After the Dunmore army had reached the Ohio river, on their homeward march, Archibald Wilson, and John and William White (his cousins) were discharged, at their own request, preferring to take their own time, and to pursue their own chosen route for their homes in the Shenandoah valley. They thereupon left the army at the mouth of the Hock-Hocking, crossed the Ohio river, and passed up it, on the Virginia side, to near the mouth of the Little Kanawha, where they found some beautiful bottom land. They thereupon proceeded to make what was called \" a tomahawk"], [813, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 8o3 improvement\" for each one, which was done by blazing the trees and cutting their initials and date upon them. They intended at some future day to occupy those lands, as such titles were valid under the laws of Virginia at that time. But John White, who was appointed a lieutenant, and operated against the Indians, was killed by them at Tygart's valley, in 1775, and William White was killed near Fort Buchannon, in West Virginia. Just as these young heroes completed there tomahawk claims they came across some fresh signs of Indians, whereupon they struck out for the mountains, and towards their homes; but fearing to fire their guns, on account of the probable nearness of hostile In dians, to kill game, and being unable to procure food otherwise much of the distance, they almost starved sometimes on their homeward journey. The other Whites that were related to the Wilsons emigrated to Kentucky soon after the Revolution. Archibald Wilson and Ann Claypool were married at the house of Cuthbert Harris, June 21, 1775, in Dunmore county, the officiating clergyman being the Rev. Peter Muhlenburg, who was at this time a Lutheran minister in Woodstock, the shire town of Dunmore, now of Shenandoah county, who the next year entered the Revolutionary army, and served with distinction to its close, when he took rank as a major general. The issue of this mar riage was six children, named Abraham C, Archi bald, Margaret, Jane, and two that died in infancy. Mrs. Ann (Claypool), Wilson died May 6, 1788. On the twentieth of January, 1776, Archibald Wilson was commissioned as lieutenant of the militia of Dunmore county, by the committee of safety of the colony of Virginia, which was com posed of Edmund Pendleton, John Page, Thomas Ludlow Lee, Dudley Diggs, W. Cabell and P. Car rington, all of whose names are attached to Lieu tenant Wilson's commission, which remains in the hands of his son, Enoch. The following is a copy of this commission : THE COMMITTEE OF SAFETY- FOR THF. COLONY OF VIRGINIA. \"To Archibald Wilson, Gentleman: \" By virtue of the Power and Authority invested in us, by the Delegates and Representatives of the several Counties and Cor porations in General Convention assembled, we, reposing espe cial Trust and Confidence in your Patriotism, Fidelity, Courage and good Conduct, do, by these Presents, constitute and appoint you to be Lieutenant of a Company of the Militia of the County of Dunmore ; and you are therefore carefully and diligently to discharge the Trust reposed in you, by disciplining all Officers and Soldiers under your command. And we do hereby require them to obey you as their Lieutenant. And you are to observe and follow all such Orders and Directions as you shall from Time to Time receive from the Convention, the Committee of Safety for the time being, or any superior Officers according to the Rules and Regulations established by the Convention. \"Given under our Hands at Williamsburgh, this twentieth day of January, Anno Domini 1776.\" The next year he was appointed captain, in which capacity he served until the close of the war. His company was present at the taking of Lord Corn wallis at Yorktown in Virginia, in October, 1781, but he was absent on account of sickness in his family. The chief service of his company was to keep the Tories in check, who were very trouble some in his section of the State, and on the South Branch. Having been a magistrate \"under the Crown,\" Captain Wilson had to take an oath of allegiance (a copy of which is still preserved) before he assumed military authority. Captain Archibald Wilson contracted a second marriage, which was consummated with Nancy Newman, on the thirty-first of August, 1791. She was of English parentage. As the fruit of this marriage six sons and two daughters were born, named respectively, in the order of their birth, as follows: Benjamin, George, Elizabeth, David, William B., John N., Winnefred Ann, and Enoch. Of the eight sons and four daughters only the last named is living. They all attained to adult age. Abraham C. was born June 20, 1776, and died on his farm near Newark, June 8, 1830. He was in the army that subjugated the \"whiskey boys\" in 1794, and also, as well as his three next younger brothers, served a tour of duty in the War of 181 2. He was universally regarded as a most excellent man. Abraham C. Wilson never married. Arch ibald was the first merchant of Newark, having sold goods here in 1804. He was well educated, and served for a term on the staff of General Gaines during the War of 181 2; and was also clerk of the first board of commissioners of Licking county.

Her house stood between the Mount Vernon road and the North fork. John, the oldest son, located on the eastern part of the section, where his son, George, now lives. Job, next oldest to Jacob, settled on the Mount Vernon road, on what is now known as the Dickinson farm. Isaac settled on the adjoining farm upon which his widow lived until November, 1880. Barbara intermar ried with John Thompson, Margaret with JameSv Robinson, of Wayne county, and Sarah became the wife of the late David Moore, one of the original proprietors of Mary Ann furnace, and an early, enterprising, successful business man, as well as a respectable and most highly esteemed citizen. The widow of David Wilson, and mother of the foregoing children, Aunt Molly, as she was gener ally called, was a woman of wonderful adaptation to pioneer life. She met with genuine, heroism the privations, labors, hardships and trials incident to widowhood, and to life on the frontiers, and had her reward in the respectability, the usefulness, the honor and virtue of her large family of sons and daughters. Highly esteemed was she, while living, for her many excellencies and matronly virtues, and the memory of such heroic pioneer women should be gratefully cherished. She died in February, 1837, in Licking county, Ohio. Wilson, the Pioneer. \u2014 Jacob, second son of David, was \"the pioneer Wilson\" in the Licking valley. He came, accompanied by Evan Payne, in the spring of 1803, and settled upon the \"Wil son section.\" He built his cabin near the big spring, where James Haggerty lives, east of the North fork, about a mile north of Newark. He brought with him a willow switch, cut on the Alleghany mountains on the way out, which he stuck into the ground at the \"big spring,\" and which grew into a large tree and is still flourishing. After raising a crop of corn, which he did on the open land in the North fork bottom, he returned to Hardy county, Virginia, where his father then lived. In March, 1804, he consummated a matri monial contract, in pursuance of a previous agree ment, with Nancy Colville, of Shenandoah county, Virginia, and immediately brought her to his cabin at the aforesaid \"big spring,\" where the \"bride of the valley\" entered upon her career of life in the wilderness. Here she witnessed, experienced, en dured, and enjoyed all the varied phases of pioneer life, for a period of almost a quarter of a century of married life, and for twenty years of widowhood dying April 16, 1848. She was the mother of eight children, all of whom survived. They were religiously trained, and have led lives of respecta bility, usefulness, and honor. The names of the 1800.

Winefred Ann, was the. wife of Isaac McMillen. She was born May 17, 1805, and died some years ago. Wilson, David, born September 8, 1751; was the third son of William Wilson, the progenitor of the Wilsons that settled on the Wilson section near Newark, Ohio. On the twenty-fourth of Sep tember, 1778, he entered into matrimony with Mary Miller, Rev. A. Moffitt being the officiating clergyman. In the summer of 1805, he, with his son, George, visited the Licking valley for the pur pose of making arrangements for an early settle ment upon his land, he having previously bargained for a portion of the Wilson section. On their homeward journey both father and son were taken sick. When they reached the residence of Archi bald Wilson in Wood county, Virginia, George was so ill that he could go no further, and there he died on the thirtieth of July. The stricken father then pursued his journey to Clarksburgh, Harrison county, Virginia, where, at the residence of his brother, Benjamin, on the twelfth of August, he also died. His youngest son, Enoch, also de ceased while the father and his brother, George, were in Ohio. David Wilson was the father of twelve children, eleven of whom were living when he left home. The death of two of them, during this summer, still left nine, most of them in their minority, and to be cared for by their widowed mother. The following record gives the names and time of birth and death of each of the children of David and Mary Wilson: John, born November 15, 1779, and died September 6, 1834, near New wark, Ohio; Jacob, born September 15, 1781, and died October 11, 1827, near Newark, Ohio; Eliza beth, born January 27, 1784, and died in infancy; George, born March 19, 1785, and died July 30, 1805, in Wood county, Virginia; Job, born October !5> !787, and died November 14, 1812, near New ark, Ohio; Isaac, born January 6, 1790, and died April 1, 185 1, near Newark, Ohio; Barbara, born February 20, 1792, and died February 2, 1822, in Licking county, Ohio; Sarah, born October 8, 1794, and died October 13, 1872, near Newark, Ohio; Margaret, born April 18, 1797, and died May 1, 1866, in Wayne county, Ohio; Abel, born March 21, 1799, and died April 14, 1870, near Utica, Ohio; Jesse, born October 3, 1801, and died December 16, 1827, in Morgan county, Ohio; Enoch, born October 21, 1803, and died July 4, 1805, in Hardy county, Virginia.

The \"Pioneer Wilson\" commenced here in the wilderness while everything about him was in a primitive state. Nature had not yet been despoiled by the hand of man. The native savages were still lingering in a scattering condition, feeble, small in numbers, and by no means desirable neighbors. Birds of prey, venomous reptiles, marauding ani mals, and ferocious beasts of the forest abounded. These natural enemies of man were more or less troublesome, and by frequent raids on the poultry yard, the chicken-coop, the pig-sty, the sheep-pen, and the barn-yard, rendered it a precarious busi ness to raise poultry, sheep, and calves. The foxes, minks, weasels and skunks called for our pioneers poultry, as well as the hawks and owls \u2014 the wild-cat and the bear were fond of their young pigs, the sheep were called for by the wolf, and the panther very naturally took to his half-grown swine and tender calves. The incident is related that the subject of this sketch was suddenly called to his cabin door, one morning in the autumn of 1805, by a great noise and commotion among his pigs, one of which had been seized for a breakfast, by a huge panther. The pig's noisy demonstra tions had very promptly drawn the attention of the dogs to his case, who came to the rescue success fully, and not only relieved him, but treed the panther. Just at this crisis the pioneer hunter reached his cabin door, and spied the beast upon the tree, the faithful dogs surrounding it, holding him in check. Of course the first impulse of the back woodsman was to bring his trusty rifle into use, which he did instanter, and the panther fell among the dogs at the first fire. Jacob died at fifty-six years of age, upon the farm which, from a wilderness, he had by industry, ener gy, and much hard labor, converted into fruitful fields. And it is due to the just man's memory to say that none of our pioneers ever died more uni versally regretted than Jacob Wilson. None more uniformly practiced the virtues that constitute a good citizen, an upright man and faithful Christian. None among us more faithfully discharged his du ties in the varied relations of life. Jacob Wilson's church relations and Christian character are pre sented at more length in pioneer paper No. 32, and in pioneer pamphlet No. 1, written by Rev. H. M. Hervey. Brief Statistics of the Other Children of William Wilson. \u2014 William was the fourth son, and came next to David. He married and had eight children, four sons and four daughters. In his old age he lived in Belmont county, Ohio, where he died at the advanced age of ninety-seven years. He was a man of equable temperament, social, boyish, mild, good disposition, musical, and happily adapted to the enjoyment of life \u2014 always contented and happy. The notes from which we write represent that when heard from in his old age he was playing the violin to his grand and great-grandchildren. John was the fifth son of William Wilson. He married Mrs. Mary Westfall, a widow, and was the father of nine children, five sons and four daugh- ters. His widow was still living in September, 1869, being then nearly ninety years of age. She was born April 2, 1780. Her name was Mary, usually called Mollie. John Wilson died at Phil- ippi, Barbour county, West Virginia. Moses, the first, died when less than two years old, at the ancestral homestead in Hardy County, Virginia. Moses, the second, died there also, when thir- teen years old. James was the eighth son of William Wilson. He married Harriet Jimeson, and had eight chil- dren, five sons and three daughters. The sons were named in the order of their birth: William, , Harvey, Presley, Vastine, and Isaac Newton. James Wilson continued to reside on a part of the old homestead until 1814 (after the decease of his parents), when he sold out and removed to Hamilton county, Ohio, where he remained three years, and then removed to Palestine, now Craw- ford county, Illinois, and died there in 1822. William, Harvey, and Vastine died in Crawford county, Illinois. Presley died in California in 1850, and Isaac Newton is living in Olney, Illi- nois. The three daughters married respectively, Jacob Sperry, Guy Smith, and J. D. Shepherd. Mrs. Sperry died at Utica, Licking county, Ohio. Mrs. Guy Smith removed to Iowa and died there. Solomon was the ninth, and youngest son of William Wilson. He married and had two chil- dren. He lived on one end ot the farm of his father, and died in Virginia, probably on the old ancestral homestead. Elizabeth Wilson was the first daughter, and tenth child of William and Elizabeth Wilson. She entered into the married relation with Abraham Clay- pool, who died May 5, 1845, she outliving him nearly four years. They had ten children, six sons and four daughters, namely: Solomon, Jacob, Ann, Peggy, Newton, Wilson, Abel, Isaac, Sallie B. and Maria E. Four of the foregoing have died, to-wit: Solomon, Peggy, Newton and Isaac. Abraham Claypool and Elizabeth, his wife, lived in Randolph county, West Virginia, where also he died. In the paper which announced his death it was stated that 41"], [816, "8o6 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. pen presents the following biographical sketch of the co-writer of this family history, the late Dr. John N. Wilson : The late Dr. John N. Wilson died at his resi dence in Newark, Ohio, October 8, 1872, after an illness that extended through many months. Dur ing the closing weeks of his protracted illness he endured much suffering, which he bore patiently and with philosophic composure. Dr. Wilson was the son of Captain Archibald Wilson, and was born in Shenandoah county, Virginia, November 21, 1802, and was, therefore, near the close of his seventieth year when he died. Sixty-six of those years were spent in Newark and its vicinity, his father having settled near the North fork, adjoin ing the then very small village of Newark, in 1806. Here he grew into manhood, and here our de ceased friend, during the years of his early man hood, acquired those habits of industry, energy, and enterprise in business pursuits, which so prom inently characterized his laborious, useful, success ful professional career. He qualified himself for the practice of medicine, under the direction and instruction of the late Dr. John J. Brice, and after attending a course of lectures in one of the medical colleges of Cincinnati, he entered upon the practice of his profession. This he pursued energetically, successfully, persistently for more than thirty years, having had a widely extended practice during all that time. Dr. Wilson entered upon his professional career with a hopeful, prom ising future. He had had some educational ad vantages denied to most of the young men who grew up with him. He was a member of a class that pursued the study of Latin, under the able in struction of Rev. Thomas D. Baird, with whom also he was engaged in studying other branches of learning. His opportunities in professional studies were also favorable, and moreover, being endowed with fair intellectual powers, with sound judg ment, and excellent common sense, it is not sur prising that he attained the position and success that were the objects of his ambitious aspirations. Dr. Wilson was one of the most public-spirited citizens, and never failed to interest himself in any movement that promised to ameliorate the con dition or promote the welfare of the people. In educational enterprises ha always took an active part, and it is most probable that his influence and efforts tended largely to their success. It is due to his memory to say that his influence was always found in favor of good morals, and that he recom mended the practice of the virtues which elevate and dignify mankind, upon the young men especi ally who were willing to recognize him as their mentor. The characteristic energy and other qualities of Dr. Wilson, as a leader, were conspicuously dis- he had travelled through the Northwest Territory as early as 1799. Several of his youngest children live in Ross county, Ohio. Margaret Wilson, eleventh child and second daughter of William and Elizabeth Wilson. \u2014 She married Cornelius Ruddell and removed to Ken tucky, and from thence into Iudiana, settling at Madison, or near it, in said State, probably while it was yet the territory of Indiana. It has not been ascertained certainly where she died, but it was probably in Indiana, and perhaps near Madi son.

Wilson, Dr. John N. \u2014 In concluding this family history it is but an act of simple justice to the memory of the late Dr. John N. Wilson to say that he collected most of the facts presented in the foregoing pages. He also wrote the first sev enteen pages of manuscript, when he became so ill as to be unable to finish it according to his plan. It was his own conception, and for several years he was engaged, by correpondence and otherwise, in the collection of the information necessary to carry out his plan. As he had thus interested himself in the history and genealogy of the branch of the Wilsons, with which he and many others in the Licking valley were identified, it is meet and proper that a more extended notice be given of him. To him are the descendants of their pro genitor, William Wilson, indebted for the preserva tion of the facts presented herewith, and for their publication, which he contemplated. By another pen the concluding pages were written \u2014 the same"], [817, "HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. 807 played during the Rebellion. Eminently patriotic, he, as a member of the \"military committee,\" was active in securing the enlistment of Licking county's quota of soldiers, his only son being of the number. And generally, throughout the whole war, he was active in promoting the interests of the government of the country. And none did more to give success to our \"sanitary fair\" than Dr. Wilson; and it may be justly said in this part ing tribute to his worth, that we have had none more truly, more patriotically devoted to the in terests of our country during the perilous years of the Rebellion, or who had its interests more at heart. Dr. Wilson was mainly instrumental in establish ing, many years ago, the \"Medical and Philosophi cal society, of Licking county,\" an association whose meetings were of great interest to those of philosophical tastes. Atheneums, lyceums, lecture associations, reading rooms, library companies, clubs, and institutions having for their object the advancement of knowledge, invariably found in him a patron and friend. He, too, was one of the founders of the \"Pioneer Historical and Anti quarian society,\" in 1867, and labored much in its behalf. A number of the most interesting and valuable of the published papers of the society, in which he brought matters of great historic and antiquarian interest under review, were the pro duction of his pen. Arch\u00e6ology, geology, and ethnology were the most attractive studies. Integrity of character, candor and devotion to truth, together with those requisites of a successful physician already mentioned, were his predomina ting characteristics. He had an extensive fund of information, acquired from books and from per sonal intercourse with intellectual and intelligent men. His reading, during the latter part of his life, was rather confined to his profession and to those sciences that incidentally related to it. In early life it was more varied. His knowledge had a wide range, embracing a great variety of subjects, other than the natural sciences, which, during the closing years of his life, were favorites with him. Dr. Wilson, in social life, had popular qualities, being a good conversationalist, and always cheer fully imparted information to those that desired. He had a logical mind, good reasoning powers, and enlargement of thought. He was outspoken, frank, faithful to his convictions, never professing faith in anything falsely, nor professing belief in anything, without arriving at such belief by investi gation and thorough examination. He was an acknowledged leader among us in the investigation of scientific truth; and as a student of nature, and of nature's works and laws, he had made fair progress. His companionship and conversation were, therefore, attractive to those of similar tastes; and his presence was always desirable among the respectable, intelligent, and most enlightened of social circles. The small circle, especially, of his chosen friends, with whom in almost daily com panionship for many years so much of pleasure was enjoyed, highly appreciated him, and greatly deplore his death. They realize that the central figure of their little group is gone, and that none will be found to take his place or act his part. Dr. Wilson entered into the marriage relations with Belinda, daughter of the late Judge Holmes, who, however, died soon thereafter. His second marriage was with Sabra Newton, of Greenfield, Massachusetts, who deceased June i, 1871. A son and a daughter survive their parents. The death of Dr. Wilson created a vacancy in this community in which he led so active and promi nent a part for so many years, that will not soon be filled. He is greatly missed, and his death is sincerely mourned by endeared relatives, and nu merous acquaintances and friends. Dr. Wilson was honored with an unsolicited membership in the \"American Philological so ciety,\" and also of other associations having in view, the promotion of literature and science. He also had the distinction of being a member of that time-honored institution, the \"American An tiquarian society.\" In literary, antiquarian, histor ical, and scientific circles, Dr. Wilson's intelligence and attainments made him an ever welcome asso ciate. Wilson, Enoch, yet living in Newark, is the youngest of the children of Captain Archibald Wil son, and the only survivor. He is the custodian of the Revolutionary commission of his father, a copy of which appears above. He is the father of two children, a son and a daughter, both deceased, though they have left a number of children. The daughter married Captain Wallace. Enoch Wilson was born May 4, 1810, and was, therefore, but four years old at the time of his father's death, in 18 14, and was the youngest of a large family of children thus left without a father. But the mother was one of those heroic pioneer women who by her good sense, sound judgment, and many excellent quali ties was admirably adapted to meet the crisis, the trying emergency she encountered, occasioned by her husband's death. She met the crisis courageous ly, discharged her duties, highly responsible as they were, with great fidelity and success, trained her children to the practice of the moral virtues, so that they became industrious, useful, upright, hon ored men and women. All honor to the memory of \"Aunt Nancy,\" whom the writer knew so well, and venerated so much, and to all such heroic pio neer mothers! Mr. Enoch Wilson has lived in Newark and the vicinity, nearly all his life, the ex-"], [818, "8o8 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. ceptions being a short residence in Dresden, Mus kingum county, and a few years that he resided in the Wabash valley, Indiana. He is one of our best known citizens, possesses intelligence and in tegrity of character, has always been patriotic, pub lic spirited, and a promoter of what he supposed would tend to advance the public welfare. Mr. Wilson has been often chosen to occupy positions of trust and responsibility, and always discharged the obligations that devolved upon him with fidel ity and honor. One of those public trusts which demands integrity and honor, quite recently con ferred upon him unsought, is that of a member of the board of trustees of our Children's Home. In 1804 Captain Archibald Wilson, with his whole family, removed from his home on Cedar creek, in the northern portion of Shenandoah county, Vir ginia, to the county of Wood, on the western bor ders of the same State, and near to where he made his \"tomahawk claim,\" thirty years before. Here he remained two years when, in March, 1806, he removed to the Licking valley and settled upon the portion of the \"Wilson section\" nearest the then four-year-old village of Newark, having previ ously purchased a few hundred acres of said sec tion from his brother, Colonel Benjamin Wilson. In the previous autumn Abraham C. Wilson, his oldest son, and his daughter Jane, came to the Licking valley and spent the winter preparing for the reception of their father's family the ensuing spring. Captain Wilson's effects, in part, and Mrs. Wilson with the smaller children, were brought up the Muskingum river to Zanesville in a pirogue, which narowly escaped wrecking on Duncan's Falls. By the slipping of the pole of one of the boatmen, the bow of the boat was whirled out into the rapidly flowing current, and soon turned down stream with great speed, being entirely beyond con trol. Before reaching the foot of the falls it passed by and barely escaped a large rock, which, if it had struck squarely, going with such great speed, would inevitably have wrecked it, and most likely have resulted in the drowning of most on board. The family were then taken around the falls by land. Their narrow escape, and the incidents connected with their passage, by pirogue up the Muskingum, were oftentimes, in after years, the subject of re mark in the family circle. A negro boy, a slave, named Ben Wilcox, the property of Captain Wilson, accompanied him from the Shenandoah valley to Wood county, and from thence to Ohio. Ben and his o ivner had pre viously arranged that if he (Ben), who was then twenty years of age, would serve faithfully until he was twenty-four years old, that he should then be set free. Ben served faithfully \u2014 was a member of Captain Wilson's family, in fact \u2014 and at the stipu lated time not only became a tree man, but for many years after continued to make the Wilson homestead his headquarters, although at work else where. He was attached to the family, especially the children, and they liked him. He received some schooling, and when free had a fair outfit of good clothes. The late Dr. Wilson related the following facts in connection with the journey from the Ohio river to the Licking valley. He said that all the family were on the pirogue except his brother George, his sister Margaret, Ben Wilcox and himself, who came on horseback. He, being only four years old, gen erally rode behind George, sometimes behind Mar garet. When their destination was reached he was riding with Margaret. His sister, Jane, who came the previous autumn, ran out of the cabin, and took him off the horse, and carressed and made a great ado over him. The house was small into which they entered; there was but a small clearing around it, enclosed by a low fence; there were woods and swamps all around in full view. All this he remembered, and also that the impression these surroundings produced upon his youthful mind were decidedly unpleasant. He further re marked that what he saw on this occasion, and the impression produced, remained distinct on his mind through life, while he remembered no event in his life before that time, nor for a year after. Captain Wilson entered courageously upon pio neer life in the Licking valley, after he had passed the meridian of life, being then fifty-seven years old, and of-course he and his family shared largely in the laborious work of clearing up the land and converting the wilderness into fruitful fields. He displayed much skill, energy and enterprise as a pioneer, and was distinguished for his early efforts in the erection of school-houses, and employing teachers, and generally in the promotion of educa tional interests. Captain Wilson, upon the organization of Lick ing county, in 1808, was elected one of its first commissioners, and continued to serve with fidel ity and acceptability in said office until his death. His widow, who was a woman of rare excellence and piety, survived him twenty-two years. Being left a widow, with a large family of children, some of them young, ample opportunities presented themselves for the display of those superior quali ties which characterized many of our pioneer wo men, and for the practice of the womanly virtues which are the glory of the sex. Mrs. Nancy Wil son was one of the most excellent of women, and has an honored memory that is still tenderly cher ished. The fragrance of gentleness, kindness, charity, always pervaded her home circle\u2014 it was ever redolent of matronly virtues, and of Christian graces. She was one of the early members of the Presbyterian church of Newark, and died in its"], [819, "809 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. communion. Mrs. Wilson, or \"Aunt Nancy,\" as she was familiarly and almost universally called, was born June 10, 1770, and died in Newark, Sep tember 23, 1836, in the sixty-seventh year of her age. Captain Wilson was a man of sound judgment, of integrity, and of great usefulness. The impulse of patriotism with him was strong \u2014 his sense of justice and right was keen, his discrimination ac curate. He was an upright and faithful public officer, a good neighbor, a just man, an intelligent citizen, a first-class pioneer. Captain Wilson was public-spirited, enterprising, and much given to taking the lead in movements tending to subserve public interests. He died, greatly regretted, at his home near Newark, March 27, 1814, in the sixty fifth year of his age. But few, if any, of the early time settlers of Licking county had deceased be fore him, whose death was deemed so great a pub lic loss, for he commanded the confidence and respect of the community, and deservedly, too, to a large extent. Captain Archibald Wilson, having borne himself worthily and honorably throughout his eventful career, and having faithfully discharged the duties that devolved upon him in all the rela tions of life, it could not be otherwise than that he should be esteemed while living, and mourned in death. Wilson, Mrs. Hattie, was born in Liberty township, Licking county, December 15, 1843. She was married to Charles B. Wilson, June 23, 1870. He was born in Newark, and died March, 1, 1876, aged forty years. Mrs- Wilson has three children \u2014 Alice, born March 30, 1871; Winnie fred, December 26, 1873; Charles C, December 8, 1875. Her parents, Mahlon Conard and wife, jof Newton township, are living, and are pioneers of the county. Her husband learned cabinet making, expecting to make it his future business, but, on account of ill-health, was obliged to give it up. He then went with his father in the grocery busi ness, in which he was engaged about fifteen years prior to his death. His father and mother, Enoch Wilson and wife, are now living on Locust street. Mrs. Wilson has a pleasant home at No. 62 Mt. Vernon street. Wilson, Hon. James F. \u2014 Hon. James F. Wil son is a native of Ohio, born in Newark, Licking county, October 19, 1828, where he continued to reside until April, 1853, when he removed to the then recently organized State of Iowa, locating at Fairfield, Jefferson county, and where he still re sides. He studied law in Newark, first in the office of William B. Woods, esq., recently appointed as sociate justice of the supreme court of the United States, in place of Judge Strong, resigned; and completing his law studies in the office of the late Hon. Lucius Case, with whom he subsequently formed a law partnership. This partnership con tinued until 1852, when for another year he con tinued the practice of his profession in the courts of Licking county. On settling in Iowa in 1853 he immediately entered upon the active and suc cessful practice of law. He was elected a member of the convention for the revision of the constitu tion of Iowa in 1856. In 1857 he was elected a member of the lower house of the general assembly of the State; and in 1859 he was elected a mem ber of the State Senate, of which body he was chosen president pro tern. The governor of Iowa had meanwhile (in 1857) appointed him assistant commissioner of the Des Moines river improve ment. In 1861 Hon. James F. Wilson was elected a member of the Thirty-seventh Congress, to serve out the unexpired term of the late General Samuel R. Curtis, who had resigned to enter the army. He served as a member of the judiciary commit tee. He was re-elected a member of the Thirty eighth, Thirty-ninth, and Fortieth Congress, serving throughout as chairman of the judiciary committee. He also served as chairman of the committee on unfinished business, and as a member of the com mittee on the Air Line railroad to New York. Mr. Wilson was also one of the managers of the im peachment trial of President Johnson. In March, 1869, President Grant tendered him the position of Secretary of State, which he declined. In the same year the President appointed him a commis sioner for the Pacific railroad. He accepted this position, and at the same time entered upon a course of active business pursuits and the practice of his profession, a line of policy which he has steadly pursued to the present time, uniformly and persistently declining official position. Hon. James F. Wilson is a gentleman of ability and decided talents, and always acquitted himself handsomely in whatever public stations he has occupied. He sustained the war measures and the policy of the Republican party generally, while a member of Congress, with much ability, and held a high rank in that body as an outspoken, earnest patriot, and as a statesman of more than ordinary shrewdness and foresight. As a thinker he is cool, deliberate, judicious, profound, philosophic. In argument he is logical, and able to present the strong points in all questions of law or politics, that he has fully considered. It is but truth to say of Hon. James F. Wilson, that he is a good lawyer, a close thinker, a writer of ability, a philosophic statesman, a good speaker, a man of integrity, and a conscientious politician, who, on all suitable occasions, gives free utterance to his convictions.

His boyhood and early manhood were spent upon the shoemaker's bench, under the supervision of his father, at which trade he was placed at the age of ten. His mother died when he was seven years old. He came to Ohio with the family about the 1816, and located in Newark where he was engaged in conducting the boot and shoe making business about forty years. When he was between ten and eleven years of age, being very anxious to go to school, he proposed to his father that if he would let him go to school one summer, he would obligate himself to perform two-thirds of a regular day's work each day. His father accepted the proposi tion, and the son made good his promise, perform ing his full task each day, running nearly a mile to the school-house and back. Mr. Young says to day that he looks back to that year as a period of his life made very important by the formation of habits of self-denial and industry. He was con verted at the age of eleven, and when about eigh teen years old, he made a public profession of religion, and connected himself with the First Presbyterian church of Newark, Ohio, and upon the organization of the Second church, in 1836, he became one of its first members, and was elected an elder in the same year, which position he has occupied for upwards of thirty years. For a num ber of years he was also superintendent of the Sabbath-school. In 1837 Mr. Young, with a sagacity worthy of commendation, secured for the church the west half of the lot upon which the present beautiful edifice stands. In 1 81 9 Mr. Young married Sarah Trindle, daughter of William Trindle, of Newark. She was born in Pennsylvania January 12, 1799. Their children were : Harriet, born March 5, 1821, and died March 28, 1821; William, born February 10, 1823, and died October 14, 1823; Matilda A., born July 8, 1825; Lavina, born in 1828, and died April 22, 1829. Matilda married Robert P. Moore, of Newark, February 8, 1848, and reared a considerable family. Mr. Moore is extensively en gaged in the stock business. Mrs. Young died June 15, 1865. She united with the First Presby terian church of Newark at an early age, upon a public profession of her Christian faith, led a very useful, consistent Christian life, was beloved by a very large circle of acquaintances, and doubly en deared in her family circle. From 1827 to 1868 Mr. Young was employed as an agent, under power of attorney, for the heirs of one of the original proprietors of Newark, to im prove rents and sell their lands, including town lots and outside property. The duties of this trust Mr. Young faithfully discharged, turning over to the heirs the entire proceeds of their property. October 25, 1825, three acres and a half were purchased by Mr. Young for the sum of sixty-five dollars. This land lies now in the heart of New ark, a part of which has for nearly fifty years con stituted his residence site. It is probably the only property in the city, owned by the same person from the date of purchase till the present time, 1880. Mr. Young has served in several public trusts, among them may be mentioned that of township treasurer, city treasurer and a member of the city council. He has also been called upon, and ap pointed to the work of settling a number of estates. Mr. Young, as was his father, is one of those quiet, peaceable, modest men who form the most valuable portion of the community. After retiring from his mechanical avocation in 1854, he engaged in conducting a farming interest, in which he con tinued till the year 1873, when he tetired from that field of labor and devoted parts of the year 1873 and 1874 in erecting the new and commodious residence that himself and family now occupy, and at the ripe old age of eighty-two, retired from the more active duties of life, with the hope of spend ing the remainder of his days in the enjoyment of his life's labors until the Master shall see fit to call him hence. NEWTON TOWNSHIP. Young, Daniel, farmer, was born in Newark, New Jersey, April 5, 1810; came to Licking county"], [826, "8i6 HISTORY OF LICKING COUNTY. serving two years. In 1870 he began to learn the printing business in the office of the Chase County Banner. The Banner was soon supplanted by the Central Kansas Index, in whose office Mr. Yale served his apprenticeship, and not long after, pur chased an interest in the paper. In the winter of 187 1 he moved the material to Wichita, and started the Wichita Tribune which existed but a short time. He edited the Winfield Messenger during the political campaign of 1872. October 28th of that year, Mr. Yale was married to Miss Carrie Sheare. In December he started the McPherson Messenger when there were only six houses in the village, now a thriving city. In 1874 Mr. Yale left Kansas, and went to Illinois where he lived one year and a half, and then came to Ohio. He en tered Denison university in 1878. July 1, 1880, he went to Alexandria; the fifteenth, was ordained to the ministry of the Baptist church, and not long after, began his labors as pastor of the congregation in Alexandria, where he is now laboring effectively and earnestly for his Master. In addition to his pulpit labors, he now conducts his periodical, re ferred to, which he began October, 1880. ADDENDA: In the preparation of works of the nature of county histories considerable matter must be omit ted in its proper place, owing to the failure of per sons possessing the same to furnish it in time, and because many events of importance occur after the forms go to press. In this work every item of history that could be obtained to the close of the year 1880 was gathered, and if received too late for insertion in its proper place, it is preserved in the addenda. In this will be found several family histories, a copy of a \"power of attorney\" from General George Washington, the \" Black Horse tavern,\" the muster rolls of two companies, who went out in the War of 181 2 from this county, the opening of the Children's Home, and officers of the agricultural society, elected for the year 1881, all furnished after their proper forms had gone to press.

He was discharged June 1, 1835, and returned home, where he resumed work at his trade. In 1836 he purchased a canal-boat, which he run until 1838, when he sold out, and went to Mississippi, where he remained until 1840, when he returned to Newark. Purchasing some horses, he took them to Mississippi, sold them, and remained there working at his trade until 1849, when he again returned home. Remaining but a short time, he went to Cincinnati, purchased horses, sugar, whiskey, flour, pork and dried beef, taking this cargo to Fort Adams, Mississippi, and selling it; remaining there working at his trade until 1856. He then returned to Newark, and soon purchased two hundred and eleven acres of land, where he now resides. The same year he went west to Des Moines, Iowa; from there to Davenport, then to St. Louis, and, finally, to Cin cinnati, where he purchased another cargo similar to the other, took it to Mississippi, and sold it, after which he remanied working at his trade until March, 1857, when he returned again to this coun ty. He made another trip south with a cargo the same year, but returend home immediately after selling out, and has remained here ever since. February 22, 1859, he married Rachel Ann Fry, who was born July 4, 1835. They had nine chil dren, seven sons and two daughters ; six of these are living. After his marriage he removed to his farm, and has been successful as a farmer. ST. ALBANS TOWNSHIP. Yale, Rev. A.

It was established in 1807, by Mr. John Cully, an energet ic, active business man, who came here from west ern Virginia. This famous tavern stood at the head of East Main street, directly north of the Park house, and just across Main street from it. For about thirty years it was managed by Mr. Cully, and may be said to have been the leading ho. tel of Newark during most of that time. The judges of the supreme court while on their annu. al circuit always stopped with \"mine host\" of the Black Horse, as did also the lawyers belonging to other counties of the State who attended our courts, and most of the travelling public did likewise. The Black Horse had the reputation of furnishing the best dinners to be had in town, and the landlady did as much at least, to give popularity and attract business to the hotel, as the landlord. Mrs. Cully lived to be more than an octogenarian, and died in the spring of 1867. The pall-bearers ont he occasion of her funeral on the way to the cemetery decided to form a pioneer soeiety, and through its instrumen tality preserve and put on record the facts of early-time history, known to such pioneers as Mrs. Cully, before they all pass to the shadow land. Mr. and Mrs. Cully had a large family of chil dren, both sons and daughters. The sons have all deceased; three of the daughters are still living, all widows: Mrs. J. M. Taylor, Mrs. J. I. Mooney, and Mrs. David Moore, whose, husbands were for many years prominent business men of Newark. One of the daughters became the wife of Judge Corrington W. Searle, a leading and well known member of the Newark bar, who is elsewhere no ticed. Both are dead, but a number of children survive them, one being the wife of Hon.

Many friends of the institution were present, participating in the exercises; entering into the enjoyment of the occasion; interchanging congratulations, and giving hearty expression to the kindly feeling that pervaded the assembly, all being in such beautiful harmony with the time, the place and the occasion. \"The arrival at the Home, in carriages, from the infimary, of the twenty-five homeless ones \u2014 their reception by the kind, sympathetic friends present, each one eager to take charge of one at least \u2014 and their introduction, one by one, into the warm rooms of the Home, presented scenes most touching; impressing themselves upon many minds from which they will not be erad icated while life shall last; but remain among the hereafter mem ories to be cherished on the other side. \"The Home now accommodates twenty-five homeless, friend less waifs, with room and accommodations for fifteen more forty in all. \" It was an interesting sight to see the little band of children, chilled as they were after their ride across the country, march in one after another into this, to them, cozy home.

Lemert Family the.* The ancestors of this fam ily were probably from Alsace, Germany, and settled in Pennsylvania about the year 1760, afterwards my grandfather migrated to Loudoun county, Virginia, where he died about 1780. His wife died in Co shoeton county, Ohio, early in the present century. Lewis Lemert, the grandfather, was bom in Penn sylvania, accompanied his father to Loudoun county, Virginia, afterwards settled and married in Fau quier county, Virginia, to Elizabeth Glasscock. They raised six sons and one daughter. Lewis Lemert died in 1817. His widow and family came to Dresden, Muskingum county, Ohio, in the au tumn of the same year, and I think, raised the first house in Dresden. The names of the sons were Thaddeus, Laban, Beverly, Leroy, Ferdinand, and Abner. The latter the only one surviving. The daughter's name, Minerva.
