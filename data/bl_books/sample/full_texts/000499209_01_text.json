The object of this book is to excite a wider interest in the works of Robert Browning. Its contents have been selected with special reference to the large number of readers who can enjoy those portions of his poetry which are clear and melodious, and do not enjoy those which tax the ingenuity and fail to please the ear. The fame of this poet is world-wide. He has inspired enthusiastic devotion in minds of the highest order ; yet he is little read. Why is this ? The fault is in the poet : not in the public. Let us first take a fair view of the ugly side of this subject. It must be confessed that Browning often fails to make himself understood, and that, where his mean-"], [16, "Preface. VI ing is plain, it is often expressed in harsh and jagged lines. One cause of his obscurity is his fondness for out-of-the-way themes, which he treats with entire indifference to the fact that they are not so familiar to his readers as to himself ; another cause is the peculiarity of his style ; his habit of contraction, and his use of idiomatic forms hitherto unknown to the English language. His devotees have excused \u2014 even justified and commended \u2014 his obscurity, and their loyalty has sometimes betrayed them into utterances which come dangerously near being nonsense. It has been said that he cares so much for the spirit of his work, that he is quite regardless of its form ; that he has such reverence for his thought that he chooses to present it in its naked simplicity. The essential fallacy of such criticism is, that it ignores the fact that poetry is always dependent upon form, that the excellence of verse depends upon perfection of structure. It is needless to enlarge upon so elementary a principle of the poetic art. Mr. Nettleship, in the course of an essay upon Sordello, published in 1868, says : \u2014"], [17, "VII Preface. \" It seems to me that we may find good reasons for the existence of these defects, so-called. He evi dently considers that his first duty as a poet is to give us direct from the fountain-head, either his percep tions, so far as they can be expressed in language, or his thoughts : that his toil should be spent in digging out straight from its hiding-place the pure unalloyed perception or thought for men to see. Thus his argument would be, either that so long as the true worth of the metal is seen, any labor spent in improving or making smooth its actual visible shape is a waste of power, or that such labor if bestowed has only the effect of lessening the bulk and tarnishing the brilliancy of the untouched con ception. \" In view of the facts of the case, ordinary, uninspired common sense revolts against this. What if the mass quarried out comes \" in such a ques tionable shape\" \u2014 is so chaotic and mysterious, that men not only doubt if it be gold, but cannot even decide whether it be mineral, animal, or veget able ?

Douglas Jerrold, was recovering from a severe illness ; while he was still confined to his bed, Sordello, then newly published, was brought to him. In a few moments he called eagerly to his wife, who came from an adjoining room, and found the invalid sitting upright in bed, with an expression of grave anxiety and apprehen sion upon his face. \" Take this ! read that page !\" She obeyed, Jerrold watching her the while with intense earnestness. \" Well ? well ? \" he exclaimed, when she looked up from the volume, \" Do you understand it? \u2014 Does it convey any idea to your mind? \" \"No, indeed ! Not the slightest ! \" \"Thank God ! \" said Jerrold; sinking back upon his pillow, \" Thank God ! I thought I had lost my reasoning powers ! \""], [19, "Preface.

Preface. for as these observations may appear, in the present instance there are good reasons for them. Pro foundly impressed by the greatness of Browning's genius, recognizing his rare qualities, believing him to be in some respects the greatest poet of his age \u2014 I am yet convinced that no attempt to show his claims to popular regard can be consistent or suc cessful, which does not proceed upon a frank ad mission of his many and glaring faults. Some of his admirers have labored to prove him great in virtue of his defects ; may it not be wiser to show that he is great in spite of those defects ? Let us try to see, then, why it is that this poet, from whom the majority of intelligent readers turn away, des pairing, if not disgusted, is hailed as master by some singers of well assured fame, and is applauded by critics whose judgment commands respect. He is a master of the technicalities of his art, and is endowed with a genuine gift of song. Few poets have held so easy and so assured a mastery over many and widely varied rhythmical forms. The prevailing tendency of his verse is toward vigor"], [21, "Preface. XI rather than beauty ; yet he has written lines which place him in the foremost rank of rhythmical melo dists ; lines filled with the spirit of music, gracious, serenely beautiful, challenging comparison with the verse of Spenser or of Keats : \u2014 ' ' And I first played the tune all our sheep know, as, one after one, So docile they come to the pen door, till folding be done. They are white and untorn by the bushes, for lo, they have fed Where the long grasses stifle the water within the stream's bed ; And now one after one seeks its lodging, as star follows star Into eve and the blue far above us \u2014 so blue and so far ! \" \u2014 Lines such as these will linger in the memory for many a year ! Some of his poems are lyrical in the strictest sense, suggesting, claiming the accompani ment of song \u2014 and well fitted to be sung. For in stance, nothing could be better in their way than the Cavalier Tunes, especially the first, Marching Along. This is a true song. Silks rustle, plumes wave, swords flash, as the gallants start from their carouse ; we hear the rollicking voices of the mad cap band as they lustily troll out their defiant battle song, and we would fain join in the ringing chorus."], [22, "Preface. XII He is eminently successful in narrative poetry, and knows thoroughly well how to tell a story, be it grave or gay. He can seize the essential features of a great action or a strange experience, and, with a few bold strokes, present a picture all aglow with color and instinct with life, leaving on the mind an impression bright as a diamond. Who can ever forget the wild gallop from Ghent to Aix, or that heroic boy who fell dead at Napoleon's feet \u2014 the smile upon his lips ? On the other hand, he can take some odd legend, like that of the Pied Piper, and sustain our interest in it through page after page ; wandering on from sheer love of story telling, adding fresh incidents, inventing new sur prises, weaving in quaint details, while we follow him as eagerly as ever the children of Hamelin ran after the fascinating piper. Humor forms a prominent element in his work ; and the quality of his humor is very remarkable, both for its strength and variety ; his range extends from easy pleasantry and good-natured banter, to grotesqueness as grim as Holbein's Dance of Death."], [23, "Preface. XIII He does not often give us descriptions of nature, but scattered throughout his works there are passa ges which show that he is not insensible to nature's charm ; passages of simple and quiet loveliness, which sink deep into the heart, without bewildering the brain. Such are to be found in Saul, and in the picturesquely descriptive Englishman in Ltaly j but the finest example of his power to portray nature, is the exquisite lyric, Home-thoughts from Abroad ; here there is absolutely no suggestion of the \" smell of the lamp \" ; all is fresh and bright and sweet \u2014 the very breath of an English spring-time caught, and stored away for us in a book ! Having thus glanced at some aspects of his verse which invite comparison with the work of other men, we may consider the poet's peculiar and characteristic excellence. Human nature is the theme and inspiration of the greater portion of Browning's poetry. Always a close observer and a keen analyst, in this field of study his observation becomes most close, his analysis most searching and subtle. Human nature"], [24, "Preface. XIV attracts and absorbs him beyond all else, leading him to scan with eager eyes alike the past and the present, to mingle with men of every face and every station. Perhaps the difficulty of his task may suggest some explanation of his frequent obscurity. The primary object of his work is the portrayal of character ; he would show what men are, not what they do ; incident and action are valued by him only in so far as they illustrate the inner life. To this end he subordinates everything, all the fruits of his scholarship, all the resources of his art, and in the pursuit of this object he has achieved his highest success, and made for himself a unique place among the poets of the world. It is his highest praise, that while his chief study is humanity, the revelation of man's \" heart of heart, \" his song is cheerful and inspiring, de claring hopes, not fears, certainties, not doubts ; passing by apparent failure in the present, to dwell upon final success. In an age of negation and querulous doubt, negation finds but little room in Browning's philosophy \u2014 pessimism, none. He"], [25, "Preface. XV is a poet of active faith, and, therefore, of strength and comfort. He utters no wail over the destiny of mankind. Though he clearly recognizes the existence of \" the heartache, and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to ; \" though he sees pain and sorrow with widely and deeply sympathetic vision, he is yet able to look forward tow>ard the consummation of all things, with a serene assurance of ultimate triumph for the race. This spirit constantly manifests itself in his work ; it animates the dreamily tender sentiment of Evelyn Hope, it may be traced more clearly in the passion ate cry of Abt Vogler, and it rises to still nobler heights in Prospice, and in the rapt ecstasy of the shepherd-boy, the inspired bard and seer, who pro claims deliverance to Saul. With two exceptions \u2014 Abt Vogler and Saul \u2014 no poem in this volume can be for a moment regarded as obscure. The aim has been to show the poet at his best ; but the principle of selection has made it necessary to exclude many poems of rare, beauty and excellence.

XVI the longer poems, although they contain much that is clear and admirable ; such fragments can seldom produce a satisfactory impression, or do any justice to their author. Despite their occasional obscurity, it was found impossible to exclude Abt Vogler and Saul, for both of these poems are among the best illustrations of the optimism which is so important an element of Browning's genius ; and, among his shorter poems, Saul is, perhaps, the one which most conspicuously manifests that creative imagination, which is the highest faculty that a poet can possess. I am indebted to Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin, & Co. for permission to make use of the ninth chapter of Mr. Stedman's Victorian Poets, which is here re i printed.

Hitherto I have given some account of an author's career and writings before proffering a critical estimate of the latter. But this man's genius is so peculiar, and he has been so isolated in style and purpose, that I know not how to speak of his works without first seeking a key to their interpreta tion, and hence must partially reverse the order hitherto pursued. I. It is customary to call Browning a dramatist, and without doubt he represents the dramatic element, such as it is, of the recent English school. He counts among his admirers many intellectual persons, some of whom pronounce him the greatest dramatic poet since Shakespeare, and one has said that \" it is to him we must pay homage for whatever is good, and great, and profound, in the second period of the Poetic Drama of England.\" This may be true ; nevertheless, it also should be declared, with certain modifications, that Robert"], [29, "Robert Browning. 3 Browning, in the original sense of the term, is not a dramatic poet at all. Procter, in the preface to a collection of his own songs, remarks with precision and truth : \" It is, in fact, this power of forgetting himself, and of imagining and fashioning characters different from his own, which constitutes the dramatic quality. A man who can set aside his own idiosyncrasy is half a dramatist.\" Although Browning's earlier poems were in the form of plays, and have a dramatic pur pose, they are at the opposite remove, in spirit and method, from the models of the true histrionic era, \u2014 the work of Fletcher, Webster, and Shakespeare. They have the sacred lage and fire, but the flame is that of Browning, and not of the separate creations which he strives to inform. The early drama was the mouthpiece of a pas sionate and adventurous era. The stage bore to the period the relations of the modern novel and news paper to our own, not only holding the mirror up to nature, but showing the \" very age and body of the time.\" It was a vital growth, sprung from the peo-"], [30, "Robert Browning. 4 pie, and having a reflex action upon their imagina tion and conduct. Even in Queen Anne's day the theatre was the meeting-place of wits, and, if the plays were meaner, it was because they copied the manners of an artificial world. But, in either case, the playwrights were in no more hazard of repre senting their own natures, in one role after another, than are the leader-writers in their versatile articles upon topics of our day. They invented a score of characters, or took them from real life, grouped them with consummate effect, placed them in dramatic situations, lightened tragedy with mirth, mellowed comedy with pathos, and produced a healthful and objective dramatic literature. They looked outward, not inward : their imagination was the richer for it, and of a more varied kind. The stage still has its office, but one more sub sidiary than of old. Our own age is no less stirring than was the true dramatic period, and is far more subtile in thought. But the poets fail to represent it objectively, and the drama does not act as a safety-valve for the escape of surplus passion and"], [31, "Robert Browning. 5 desire. That office the novelists have undertaken, while the press brings its dramas to every fireside. Yet the form of the play still seems to a poet the most comprehensive mould in which lo cast a mas terpiece. It is a combination of scenic and plastic art ; it includes monologue, dialogue, and song, \u2014 action and meditation, \u2014 man and woman, the lover, the soldier, and the thinker, \u2014 all vivified by the imagination, and each essential to the completeness of the whole. Even to poets like Byron, who have no perception of natures differing from their own, it has a fascination as a vehicle of expression, and the result is seen in \" Sardanapalus \" and \" Cain.\" Hence the closet-drama ; and although praise worthy efforts, as in \" Virginius \" and \" Ion,\" have been made to revive the early method, these modern stage-plays often are unpoetical and tame. Most of what is excellent in our dramatic verse is to be found in plays that could not be successfully en acted. While Browning's earlier poems are in the dramatic form, his own personality is manifest in"], [32, "Robert Browning. 6 the speech and movement of almost every character of each piece. His spirit is infused, as if by metempsychosis, within them all, and forces each to assume a strange Pentecostal tone, which we dis cover to be that of the poet himself. Bass, treble, or recitative, \u2014 whether in pleading, invective, or banter, \u2014 the voice still is there. But while his characters have a common manner and diction, we become so wonted to the latter that it seems like a new dialect which we have mastered for the sake of its literature. This feeling is acquired after some acquaintance with his poems, and not upon a first or casual reading of them. The brief, separate pieces, which he terms \" dramatic lyrics,\" are just as properly dramas as are many of his five-act plays. Several of the latter were intended for stage-production. In these we feel that the author's special genius is hampered, so that the student of Browning deems them less rich and rare than his strictly characteristic essays. Even in the most conventional, this poet cannot refrain from the long monologues, stilted action,"], [33, "Robert Browning. 7 and metaphysical discursion, which mark the closet drama and unfit a composition for the stage. His chief success is in the portrayal of single characters and specific moods. I would not be understood to praise his originality at the expense of his greatness. His mission has been that of exploring those secret regions which gene rate the forces whose outward phenomena it is for the playwrights to illustrate. He has opened a new field for the display of emotional power, \u2014 found ing, so to speak, a sub-dramatic school of poetry whose office is to follow the workings of the mind, to discover the impalpable elements of which human motives and passions are composed. The greatest forces are the most elusive, the unseen mightier than the seen ; modern genius chooses to seek for the under-currents of the soul rather than to depict acts and situations. Browning, as the poet of pys chology, escapes to that stronghold whither, as I have said, science and materialism are not yet pre pared to follow him. How shall the chemist read the soul ? No former poet has so relied upon this"], [34, "8 Robert Browning. province for the excursions of his muse. True, he explores by night, stumbles, halts, has vague ideas of the topography, and often goes back upon his course. But, though others complete the unfinished work of Columbus, it is to him that we award the glory of discovery, \u2014 not to the engineers and colo nists that succeed him, however firmly they plant themselves and correctly map out the now undis puted land. II. Browning's manner is so eccentric as to challenge attention and greatly affect our estimate of him as a poet. Eccentricity is not a proof of genius, and even an artist should remember that originality con sists not only in doing things differently, but also in \" doing things better.\" The genius of Shakes peare and Moliere enlarged and beautified their style; it did not distort it. Again, the grammarian's statement is true, that Poetry is a means of Expres sion. A poet may differ from other men in having profounder emotions and clearer perceptions, but"], [35, "Robert Bro7t>ning. 9 this is not for him to assume, nor a claim which they are swift to grant. The lines, \" O many are the poets that are sown By Nature ! men endowed with highest gifts, The vision and the faculty divine ; Yet wanting the accomplishment of verse,\" imply that the recognized poet is one who gives voice, in expressive language, to the common thought and feeling which lie deeper than ordinary speech. He is the interpreter : moreover, he is the maker, \u2014 an artist of the beautiful, the inventor of harmonious numbers which shall be a lure and a repose. A poet, however emotional or rich in thought, must not fail to express his conception and make his work attractive. Over-possession is worth less than a more commonplace faculty ; he that has the former is a sorrow to himself and a vexation to his hearers, while one whose speech is equal to his needs, and who knows his limitations, adds some thing to the treasury of song, and is able to shine in"], [36, "Robert Browning. 10 his place, \" and be content' Certain effects are suggested by nature; the poet discovers new com binations within the ground which these afford. Ruskin has shown that in the course of years, though long at fault, the masses come to appreciate any admirable work. By inversion, if, after a long time has passed, the world still is repelled by a singer, and finds neither rest nor music in him, the fault is not with the world ; there is something deficient in his genius, \u2014 he is so much the less a poet. The distinction between poetry and prose must be sharply observed. Poetry is an art, \u2014 a specific fact, which, owing to the vagueness fostered by minor wits, we do not sufficiently insist upon. We hear it said that an eloquent prose passage is poetry, that a sunset is a poem, and so on. This is well enough for rhetorical effect yet wholly untrue, and no poet should permit himself to talk in that way. Poetry is poetry, because it differs from prose ; it is artificial, and gives us pleasure because we know it to be so. It is beautiful thought expressed in rhyth mical form, not half expressed or uttered in the"], [37, "Robert Browning. 11 form of prose. It is a metrical structure ; a spirit not disembodied, but in the flesh, \u2014 so as to affect the senses of living men. Such is the poetry of Earth ; what that of a more spiritual region may be I know not. Milton and Keats never were in doubt as to the meaning of the art. It is true that fine prose is a higher form of expression than wretched verse ; but when a distinguished young English poet thus writes to me, \u2014 ' ' My own impression is that Verse is an inferior, or infant, form of speech, which will ultimately perish altogether. . . The Seer, the Vates, the teacher of a new truth, is single, while what you call artists are legion,\" \u2014 when I read these words, I remember that the few great seers have furnished models for the sim plest and greatest form of art ; I feel that this poet is growing heretical with respect, not to the law of custom, but to a law which is above us all ; I fear to discover a want of beauty, a vague transcenden talism, rather than a clear inspiration, in his verse, \u2014 to see him become prosaic and substitute rhetoric for passion, realism for naturalness, affectation for"], [38, "Robert Browning. 12 lofty thought, and, \" having been praised for blunt ness,\" to \"affect a saucy roughness.\" In short, he is on the edge of danger. Yet his remark denotes a just impatience of forms so hackneyed that, once beautiful, they now are stale and corrupt. It may be necessary, with the Pre-Raphaelites, to escape their thraldom and begin anew. But the poet is a creator, not an iconoclast, and never will tamely en deavor to say in prose what can only be expressed in song. And I have faith that my friend's wings will unfold, in spite of himself, and lift him bravely as ever on their accustomed flights. Has the lapse of years made Browning any more attractive to the masses, or even to the judicious few ? He is said to have \" succeeded by a series of failures,\" and so he has, as far as notoriety means success, and despite the recent increase of his faults. But what is the fact which strikes the admiring and sympathetic student of his poetry and career ? Dis trusting my own judgment, I asked a clear and im partial thinker, \u2014 \" How does Browning's work im press you ? \" His reply, after a moment's consider-"], [39, "Robert Browning. 13 ation was: \" Now that I try to formulate the sen sation which it always has given me, his work seems that of a grand intellect painfully striving for ade quate use and expression, and never quite attain ing either.\" This was, and is, precisely my own feeling. The question arises, What is at fault ? Browning's genius, his chosen mode of expression, his period, or one and all of these ? After the flush of youth is over, a poet must have a wise method, if he would move ahead. He must improve upon instinct by experience and common-sense. There is something amiss in one who has to grope for his theme and cannot adjust himself to his per iod ; especially in one who cannot agreeably handle such themes as he arrives at. More than this, how ever, is the difficulty in Browning's case. Expres sion is the flower of thought ; a fine imagination is wont to be rhythmical and creative, and many pas sages, scattered throughout Browning's works, show that his is no exception. It is a certain caprice or perverseness of method, that, by long practice, has injured his gift of expression ; while an abnor-"], [40, "Robert Browning. 14 mal power of ratiocination, and a prosaic regard for details, have handicapped him from the begin ning. Besides, in mental arrogance and scorn of authority, he has insulted Beauty herself, and fur nished too much excuse for small offenders. What may be condoned in one of his breed is intolerable when mimicked by every jackanapes and self-ap pointed reformer. A group of evils, then, has interfered with the greatness of his poetry. His style is that of a man caught in a morass of ideas through which he has to travel, \u2014 wearily floundering, grasping here and there, and often sinking deeper until there seems no prospect of getting through. His latest works have been more involved and excursive, less .beautiful and elevating, than most of those which preceded them. Possibly his theory is that which was his wife's instinct, \u2014 a man being more apt than a wom an with some reason for what he does, \u2014 that poetry is valuable only for the statement which it makes, and must always be subordinate thereto. Neverthe less, Emerson, in this country, seems to have sol-"], [41, "Robert Browning. 15 lowed a kindred method ; and who of our poets is greater, or so wise ? Ill, Browning's early lyrics, and occasional passages of recent date, show that he has melodious intervals, and can be very artistic with no loss of original power. Often the ring of his verse is sonorous, and overcomes the jagged consonantal diction with stir ring lyrical effect. The \" Cavalier Tunes \" are examples. Such choruses as \" Marching along, fifty-score strong, Great-hearted gentlemen, singing this song ! \" \" King Charles, and who'll do him right now ? King Charles, and who's ripe for fight now ? Give a rouse : here's, in Hell's despite now, King Charles ! \" \u2014 these, with, \" Boot, saddle, to horse, and away !\" show that Browning can put in verse the spirit of a historic period, and has, or had, in him the making of a lyric poet. How fresh and wholesome this work ! Finer still that superb stirrup-piece, best of"], [42, "Robert Browning. 1 6 its class in the language, \" How they brought the good news from Ghent to Aix.\" \" Ratisbon\" and \" The Lost Leader,\" no less, are poems that fasten themselves upon literature, and will not be forgotten. The old fire flashes out, thirty years after, in \" Herve Riel,\" another vigorous production, \u2014 unevenly sustained, but on a level with Longfellow's legendary ballads and sagas. From among lighter pieces I will select for present mention two, very unlike each other ; one, as delightful a child's poem as ever was written, in fancy and airy extravagance, and having a wildness and pathos all its own, \u2014 the daintest bit of folk-lore in English verse, \u2014 to what should I refer but \" The Pied Piper of Hamelin ?\" The author made a strong bid for the love of chil dren, when he placed \" By Robert Browning \" at its head, in the collection of his poems.

Browning's style is the more aggressive, because, in compelling beauty itself to suffer a change and conform to all exigencies, it presents such a con trast to the refined art of our day. I have shown that much of this is due to natural awkwardness, \u2014 but that the author is able, on fortunate occasions, to better his work, has just been amply illustrated.

If the mischief ceased here, it would not be so bad, but his genius has won pupils who copy his vices without his strength. He and his wife injured each the other's style as much as they sustained their common aspiration and love of poesy.

Parodies on his style, thrown off as burlesques, are more intelligible than much of his \" Dramatis Person\u00e6.\" Unlike Tennyson, he does not comprehend the limits of a theme ; nor has he an idea of the relative importance either of themes or details ; his mind is so alert that its minutest turn of thought must be uttered ; he dwells with equal precision upon the meanest and grandest objects, and laboriously jots down every point that occurs to him, \u2014 parenthesis within parenthesis, \u2014 until we have a tangle as intricate as the line drawn by an anemometer upon the recording-sheet.

Apply the rule that nothing should be told in verse which can be told in prose, and half his measures would be condemned ; since their chief metrical purpose is, through the stress of rhythm, to fix our attention, by a certain unpleasant fascina tion, upon a process of reasoning from which it otherwise would break away. For so much of Browning's crudeness as comes. from inability to express himself, or to find a proper theme, he may readily be forgiven ; but whatever is due to real or assumed irreverence for the divine art, among whose votaries he stands enrolled, is a grievous wrong, unworthy of the humble and delightful spirit of a true craftsman. He forgets that art is the bride of the imagination, from whose embraces true creative work must spring. Lastly, concerning realism, while poets are, as Mrs. Brown ing said, \"your only truth-tellers,\" it is not well that repulsive or petty facts should always be recorded ; only the high, essential truths demand a poet's illumination. The obscurity wherein Browning dis guises his realism is but the semblance of imagina-"], [46, "Robert Browning. 20 tion, \u2014 a mist through which rugged details jut out, while the central truth is feebly to be seen. IV. After a period of study at the London University young Browning, in 1832, went to Italy, and acquired a remarkable knowledge of the Italian life and lan guage. He mingled with all classes of the people, mastered details, and rummaged among the monas teries of Lombardy and Venice, studying medi\u00e6val history, and filling his mind with the relics of a bygone time. All this had much to do with the bent of his subsequent work, and possibly was of more benefit to his learning than to his ideality. At the age of twenty-three he published his first drama, Paracelsus , a most unique production, \u2014 strictly speaking, a metaphysical dialogue, as notice able for analytic power as the romances of Keats for pure beauty. It did not find many readers, but no man of letters could peruse it without seeing that a genuine poet had come to light. From that time the author moved in the literary society of London,"], [47, "Robert Browning. 21 and was recognized as one who had done something and might do something more. The play is \" Faust,\" with the action and passion, and much of the poetry and music, \u2014 upon which the fascination of the Ger man work depends, \u2014 omitted ; the hero resembles \" Faust \" in the double aspiration to know and to enjoy, to search out mystical knowledge, yet drink at all the fountains of pleasure, \u2014 lest, after a long struggle, failing of knowledge, he should have lived in vain. It must be understood that Mr. Brown- ing's Paracelsus was his own creation : a man of heroic longings, observed at various intervals, from his twentieth year, in which he leaves his native hamlet until he dies at the age of forty-eight, \u2014 obscure, and with his ideal seemingly unattained ; not the juggler, empiric, and charlatan of history, whose record the poet frankly gives us in a foot- note. This poem has every characteristic of Browning's genius. The verse is as strong and as weak as the best and worst he has composed during thirty years, and is pitched in a key now familiar to us all."], [48, "Robert Browning. 22 \" Paracelsus,\" the fruit of his youth, serves as well for a study of this poet as any later effort, and, though inferior to \" Pippa Passes \" and \" In a Bal cony,\" is much better than his newest romance in blank verse. I cannot agree with critics who say that he did his poorest work first and has been mov ing along an ascending scale ; on the contrary, his faults and beauties have been somewhat evenly dis tributed throughout his career. We are vexed in \" Paracelsus \" by a vice that haunts him still, \u2014 that tedious garrulity which, however relieved by beauti ful passages, palls on the reader and weakens the general effect. As an offset, he displays in this poem, with respect to every kind of poetic faculty except the sense of proportion, gifts equal to those of any compeer. By turns he is surpassingly fine. We have strong dramatic diction : \u2014 \" Festus, strange secrets are let out by Death, Who blabs so oft the follies of this world : And I am Death's familiar, as you know. I helped a man to die, some few weeks since ; No mean trick"], [49, "Robert Browning. 23 He left untried ; and truly wellnigh wormed All traces of God's finger out of him. Then died, grown old; and just an hour before \u2014 Having lain long with blank and soulless eyes \u2014 He sate up suddenly, and with natural voice Said, that in spite of thick air and closed doors God told him it was June , and he knew well, Without such telling, harebells grew in June ; And all that kings could ever give or take Would not be precious as those blooms to him.\" The conception is old as Shakespeare, but the manner is large and effective. Few authors vary the breaks and pauses of their blank verse so natur ally as Browning, and none can so well dare to extend the proper limits of a poem. Here, as in later plays, he shows a more realistic perception of scenery and nature than is common with dramatic poets. We have a bit of painting at the outset, in the passage beginning, \" Nay Autumn wins you best by this its mute Appeal to sympathy for its decay ! \" and others, equally sine and true, are scattered throughout the dialogue."], [50, "Robert Browning. 24 \"Paracelsus\" is meant to illustrate the growth and progress of a lofty spirit, groping in the dark ness of his time. He first aspires to knowledge, and fails ; then to pleasure and knowledge, and equally fails \u2014 to human eyes. The secret ever seems close at hand : \u2014 \"Ah, the curse, Aprile, Aprile ! We get so near \u2014 so very, very near ! 'Tis an old tale : Jove strikes the Titans down Not when they set about their mountain-piling, But when another rock would crown their work !\" Now, it is a part of Browning's life-long habit, that he here refuses to judge by ordinary standards, and makes the hero's attainment lie even in his fail ure and death. There are few more daring asser tions of the soul's absolute freedom than the words of Festus, impressed by the nobility of his dying friend : \u2014 \" I am for noble Aureole, God ! I am upon his side, come weal or woe ! His portion shall be mine ! He has done well ! I would have sinned, had I been strong enough,"], [51, "Robert Browning. 25 As he has sinned ! Reward him, or I waive Reward ! If thou canst find no place for him He shall be king elsewhere, and I will be His slave forever ! There are two of us ! \" The drama is well worth preserving, and even now a curious and highly suggestive study. Its lyrical interludes seem out of place.

In \"Stratford,\" his second drama, the interest also centres upon the struggles and motives of one heroic personage, this time entangled in a fatal mesh 01 great events. Apparently the poet, after some experience of authorship, wished to commend his work to popular sympathy, and tried to write a play that should be fitted for the stage ; hence a tragedy dedicated to Macready, of which the chief character, \u2014 the hapless Earl of Strafford, \u2014 was assumed by that tragedian, but with no marked sue-"], [52, "26 Robert Browning. cess. The action, in compliance with history, moves with sufficient rapidity, yet in a confused and turbu lent way. The characters are eccentrically drawn, and are more serious and mystical than even the gloom of their period would demand. It is hard to perceive the motives of Lady Carlisle and the Queen ; there is no underplot of love in the play, to develop the womanly element, nor has it the humor of the great playwrights, \u2014 so essential to dramatic contrast, and for which the Puritans and the Lon don populace might afford rich material. Imagine Macready stalking portentously through the piece, the audience trying to follow the story, and bored beyond endurance by the solemn speeches of Pym and Strafford, which answer for a death-scene at the close. The language is more natural than is usual with Browning, but here, where he is least eccentric, he becomes tame \u2014 until we see that he is out of his element, and prefer his striking psychology to a forced attempt at writing of the academic kind. Something of this must have struck the poet him self for, as if chagrined at his failure, he swung back"], [53, "Robert Browning. 27 to the other extreme, and beyond his early starting place ; farther, happily, than any point he since has ventured to reach. In no one of his recent works has he been quite so \"hard,\" loquacious, and im practicable as in the renowned nondescript entitled Sordello. Twenty-three years after its appearance he owned that its \" faults of expression were many,\" and added, \" but with care for a man or book such would be surmounted.\"- The acknowledgment was partial. \" Sordello \" is a fault throughout, in con ception and execution : nothing is \" expressed, \" not even the \" incidents in the development of a soul,\" though such incidents may have had some nebulous origin in the poet's mind.

The structure, by its very ugliness and bulk, like some half buried colossus in the desert, may survive a lapse of time. I cannot persuade myself to solicit credit for deeper insight by differing from the common judgment with regard to this unattrac tive prodigy. It had its uses, seemingly, in acting as a purge to cleanse .the visual humors of the poet's eyes and to leave his general system in an auspicious condition. His next six years were devoted to the composition of a picturesque group of dramas, \u2014 the exact order of which escapes me, but which finally were collec ted in Bells and Pomegranates, a popular edition, issued in serial numbers, of this maturer work. \" Luria,\" \"King Victor and King Charles,\" and \" The Return of the Druses,\" are stately pieces, historical or legendary, cast in full stage-form. In Luria we again see Browning's favorite characteri zation, from a different point of view. This is a large-moulded, suffering hero, akin, if disturbed in conscience, to Wallenstein, \u2014 if devoted and magnan imous, to Othello. Luria, the Moor, is like"], [55, "Robert Browning. 29 Othello in many ways : a brave and skillful general, who serves Florence (instead of Venice), and declares, I can and have perhaps obliged the state, Nor paid a mere son's duty. \" He is so true and simple, that Domizia says of him, ' How plainly is true greatness charactered By such unconsciousness as Luria's here, And sharing least the secret of itself ! \" Browning makes devotion to an ideal or trust, how ever unworthy of it, the chief trait of this class of personages. Strafford dies in behalf of ungrateful Charles ; Luria is sacrificed by the Florence he has saved, and destroys himself at the moment when love and honor are hastening, too late, to crown him. Djabal, false to himself, is true to the cause of the Druses, and at last dies in expiation of his fault. Valence, in \" Colombe's Birthday,\" shows devotion of a double kind, but is rewarded for his fidelity and honor. Luitolfo, in \" A Soul's Tragedy,\" is of a kindred type. But I am anticipating. The language"], [56, "Robert Browning. 30 of \" Luria \" often is in the grand manner. In depict ing the Moorish general and his friend Husain, \u2014 brooding, generous children of the sun, \u2014 the soldierly Tiburzio, painted with a few ma:ter strokes, \u2014 and in the element of Italian craft and intrigue, the author is at home and well served by his knowledge of medi\u00e6val times. That is an eloquent speech of Domizia, near the end of the fourth act. Despite the poverty of action, and the prolonged harangues, this drama is worthy of its dedication to Landor and the wish that it might be \" read by his light \" : almost worthy (Landor always weighed out gold for silver !) of the old bard\"s munificent return of praise : \u2014 \" Shakespeare is not our poet but the world's, Therefore on him no speech ! and brief for thee, Browning ! Since Chaucer was alive and hale, No man hath walked along our roads with step So active, so inquiring eye, or tongue So varied in discourse.

The girl Anael is an impas sioned character, divided between adoration for Hakeem, the god of her race, \u2014 whom she believes incarnate in Djabal, \u2014 and her love for Djabalas a man. The tragedy, amid a good deal of trite and pedantic language, is marked by heroic situations and sudden dramatic catastrophes. Several brilliant points are made : one, where the Prefect lifts the arras, on the other side of which death awaits him, and says, \u2014 \" This is the first time forlongyears I enter Thus, without feeling just as I lifted The lid up of my tomb ! Let me repeat \u2014 \u25a0 for the first time, no draught Coming as from a sepulchre salutes me ! \" A moment, and the dagger is through his heart. Another such is the wonder and contempt of Anael"], [58, "Robert Browning. 32 at finding Djabal no deity, but an impostor ; while perhaps the most telling point in the whole series of Browning's plays is her cry of Hakeem ! made when she comes to denounce Djabal, but, moved by love, proclaims him as the god, and falls dead with the effort. The poet, however, is justly censured for too frequently taking off his personages by the intensity of their own passions, without recourse to the dag ger and bowl. He rarely does it after the \"high Roman fashion.\" This tragedy observes the classic unities of time and place. A hall in the Prefect's palace is made to cover its entire action, which occupies only one day. In its earnest pitch and lack of sprightly underplot, it also is Greek or Italian. Not long ago, listening to Salvini in \" Samson \" and other plays, I was struck by their likeness, in simplicity of action and costume, to the antique dramas. The actors were sufficient to themselves, and the audience was intent upon their lofty speech and passion ; there was no lack of interest, but a refresh ing spiritual elevation. The Gothic method better"], [59, "Robert Browning. 33 suits the English stage, nevertheless we need not refuse to profit by the experience of other lands. Our poetry, like the language, should draw its riches from all tongues and races, and well can endure a larger infusion of the ancient grandeur and simplic ity. In the play before us Browning has but renew ed the debt, long since incurred, of English literat ure to the Italian, \u2014 greater than that to all other sources combined. Not without reason, in \" De Gustibus,\" he sang, \u2014 Open my heart and you will see, Graved inside of it, 'Italy.' Such lovers old are I and she ; So it always was, so it still shall be ! \" \"King Victor,\" is one of those conventional plays in which he appears to ordinary advantage. His three dramatic masterpieces are \" Pippa Passes,\" \"A Blot in the 'Scutcheon.\" and \" Colombe's Birthday.\" The last-named play, inscribed to Barry Cornwall, really is a fresh and lovely little drama. The fair young heroine has possessed her duchy for a 2"], [60, "Robert Browning. 34 single year, and now, upon her birthday, as she unsuspectingly awaits the greetings of her courtiers, is called upon to surrender her inheritance to Prince Berthold, decreed to be the lawful heir. At the same time Valence, a poor advocate of Cleves, seeks audience in behalf of his suffering townsmen, and ends by defending the Duehess's title to her rank. She loves him, and is so impressed by his nobility and courage as to decline the hand of the Prince, and surrender her duchy, to become the wife of Valence, with whom she joyfully retires to the ruined castle where her youth was spent. This play might be performed to the great interest of an audience composed exclusively of intellectual per sons, who could follow the elaborate dialogue and would be charmed with its poetry and subtle thought. Once accept the manner of Browning, and you must be pleased with the delineation of the characters. \"Colombe\" herself is exquisite, and like one of Shakespeare's women. Valence seems too harsh and dry to win her, and her choice, des pite his loyalty and intellect, is hardly defensible."], [61, "Robert Browning. 35 Still, \"Colombe's Birthday\" is the most natural and winsome of the author's stage-plays. \" A Blot in the 'Scutcheon \" was brought out at Drury Lane, in 1843, and failed. This of course, for there is little in it to relieve the human spirit, \u2014 which cannot bear too much of earnestness and woe added'to the mystery and burden of our daily lives. Yet the piece has such tragic strength as to stamp the author as a great poet, though in a narrow range. One almost for.gets the singular improbabil ities of the story, the blasts talk of the child-lovers (an English Juliet of fourteen is against nature), the stiff language of the retainers, and various other blemishes. There is a serenade in which, unchecked by his fear of detection, Mertoun is made to sing under Mildred's window, \u2014 \" There's a woman like the dew drop, she's so purer than the purest ! *' This song, composed seven years before the poet's meeting with Miss Barrett, is precisely in the style of \" Lady Geraldine's Courtship,\" and other bal lads of the gifted woman who became his wife."], [62, "36 Robert Browning. The most simple and varied of his plays \u2014 that which shows every side of his genius, has most light ness and strength, and all in all may be termed a rep resentative poem \u2014 is the beautiful drama with the quaint title of \" Pippa Passes.\" It is a cluster of four scenes, with prologue, epilogue, and interludes ; half prose, half poetry, varying with the refinement of the dialogue. Pippa is a delicately pure, good, blithesome, peasant-maid. \" ' Tis but a little black eyed, pretty, singing Felippa, gay silk-winding girl,\" \u2014 though with token, ere the end, that she is the child of a nobleman, put out of the way by a villain, Maffeo, at instigation of the next heir. Pippa knows nothing of this, but is piously content with her life of toil. It is New Year's Day at Asolo. She springs from bed, in her garret chamber, at sunrise, \u2014 resolv ed to enjoy to the full her sole holiday : she will not \" squander a wavelet \" of it, not a \" mite of her twelve hours' treasure.\" Others can be happy throughout the year : haughty Ottima and Sebald, the lovers on the hill ; Jules and Phene, the artist and his bride ; Luigi and his mother ; Monsignor,"], [63, "Robert Browning. 37 the Bishop ; but Pippa has only this one day to enjoy. She envies these great ones a little, but reflects that God's love is best, after all. And yet, how little can she do ! How can she possibly affect the world ? Thus she muses, and goes out, singing, to her holiday and the sunshine. Now, it so happens that she passes, this day, each of the groups or persons we have named, at an important crisis in their lives, and they hear her various carols as she trills them forth in the innocent gladness of her heart. Sebald and Ottima have murdered the latter's aged husband, and are unremorseful in their guilty love. Jules is the victim of a fraud practised by his rival artists, who have put in his way a young girl, a paid model, whom he believes to be a pure and cultured maiden. He has married her, and just discovered the imposture. Luigi is hesitating whether to join a patriotic conspiracy. Monsignor is tempted by Maffeo to overlook his late brother's murder, for the sake of the estates, and to utterly ruin Pippa. The scene between Ottima and Sebald is the most intense and striking passage of all Browning's"], [64, "3\u00ab Robert Browning. poetry, and, possibly, of any dramatic verse compos ed during his lifetime up to the date of this play. A passionate esoteric theme is treated with such vigor and skil^as to free it from any debasing taint, in the dialogue from which I quote : \u2014 - \" Ottima. . . The past, would you give up the past Such as it is, pleasure and crime together ?

Sebald is stricken with fear and remorse ; his para mour becomes hideous in his eyes ; he bids her dress her shoulders, wipe off that paint, and leave him, for he hates her ! She, the woman, is at least true to her lover, and prays God to be merciful, not to her, but to him. The scene changes to the post-nuptial meeting of Jules and Phene, and then in succession to the other passages and characters we have mentioned. All these persons are vitally affected, \u2014 have their lives changed, merely by Pippa's weird and suggestive songs, coming, as if by accident, upon their hearing at that critical moment. With certain reservations this is a strong and delicate conception, admirably worked out. The usual fault is present : the characters, whether students, peasants, or soldiers, all talk like sages ; Pippa reasons like a Paracelsus in pantalets, \u2014 her intellectual songs are strangely put in the mouth of an ignorant silk winding girl ; Phene is more natural, though mature, even for Italy, at fourteen.

In the epilogue Pippa seeks her garret, and, as she dis robes, after artlessly running over the events of her holiday, soliloquizes thus : \u2014 \" Now, one thing I should like really to know: How near I ever might approach all these I only fancied being, th is long day \u2014 \u2014 Approach, I mean j so as to touch them \u2014 so As to . . in some way . . move them \u2014 if you please, Do good or evil to them some slight way. \" Finally, she sleeps, \u2014 unconscious of her day's mis sion, \u2014 and of the fact that her own life is to be something more than it has been, \u2014 but not until she has murmured these words of a hymn : \u2014 \"All service is the same with God, \u2014 With God, whose puppets, best and worst, Are we : there is no last nor first.\" \" Pippa Passes\" is a work of pure artt and has a wealth of original fancy and romance, apart from"], [68, "Robert Browning. 42 its wisdom, to which every poet will do justice. Its faults are those of style and undue intellectuality. To quote the author's words, in another drama, \" Ah? well ! he o'er-resines, \u2014 the scholar's fault ! * As it is, we accept his work, looking upon it as up on some treasured yet bizarre painting of the mixed school, whose beauties are the more striking for its defects.

Everything from this poet is, or used to be, of value and interest, and \" A Soul's Tragedy \" is of both : first, for a masterly distinction between the action of sentiment and that founded on, principle, and, secondly, for wit, satire, and knowledge of affairs. Ogniben, the Legate, is the most thorough man of the world Browning has drawn. That is a matchless stroke, at the close, where he says: \" I have seen four-and-twenty leaders of revolts.\" It is a consolation to recall this when a pretender arises ; his race is measured, \u2014 his fall shall surely come."], [69, "Robert Browning. 43 With \"Luria,\" thirty years ago, Browning, whose stage-plays had been failures, and whose closet-dra mas had found too small a reading, made his \" last attempt, for the present, at dramatic poetry.\" It remains to examine his miscellaneous after-work, including the long poems which have appeared within the last five years, \u2014 the most prolific, if not the most creative, period of his untiring life. V. Something of a dramatic character pertains to nearly all of Browning's lyrics. Like his wife, he has preferred to study human hearts rather than the forms of nature. A note to the first collection of his briefer poems places them under the head of Dramatic Pieces. This was at a time when English poets were enslaved to the idyllic method, and for got that their readers had passions most suggestive to art when exalted above the tranquillity of pictur esque repose. Herein Browning justly may claim originality. Even the Laureate combined the art of Keats with the contemplative habit of Words-"], [70, "Robert Bro7cming. 44 worth, and adapted them to his own times ; while Browning was the prophet of that reaction which holds that the proper study of mankind is man. His effort, weak or able, was at figure-painting, in distinction from that of landscape or still life. It has not flourished during the recent period, but we are indebted to him for what we have of it. In an adverse time it was natural for it to assume peculiar, almost morbid phases ; but of this struggling, turbid figure-school, \u2014 variously represented by the young er Lytton, Rossetti, Swinburne, and others, he was the long-neglected progenitor. His genius may have been unequal to his aims. It is not easy for him to combine a score of figures upon the ample canvas : his work is at its best in separated ideals, or, rather, in portraits, \u2014 his dramatic talent being more realistic than imaginative. Still, portraiture, in a certain sense, is the highest form of painting, and Browning's personal studies must not be under valued. As usual, even here he is unequal, and, while some of them are matchless, in others, like all men of genius who aim at the highest, he conspicu-"], [71, "Robert Browning. 45 ously fails. A man of talent may never fail, yet never rise above a fixed height. Yet if Browning were a man of great genius his failures would not so outnumber his successes that half his lyrics could be missed without injury to his reputation. The shorter pieces, \" Dramatic Romances and Lyrics,\" in the first general collection of his works, are of a better average grade than those in his latest book of miscellanies. One of the best is \" My Last Duchess,\" a masterly sketch, comprising within sixty lines enough matter to furnish Browning, nowadays, with an excuse for a quarto. Nothing can be sub tler than the art whereby the Duke is made to reveal a cruel tragedy of which he was the relentless vil lain, to betray the blackness of his heart, and to suggest a companion-tragedy in his betrothal close at hand. Thus was introduced a new method, ap plied with such coolness as to suggest the idea of vivisection or morbid anatomy. But let us group other lyrics in this collection with the matter of two later volumes, Men and Wo men, and Dramatis Pcrson\u00e6. These books, made"], [72, "46 Robert Browning. up of isolated poems, contain the bulk of his work during the eighteen years which followed his mar riage in 1846. While their contents include no long poem or drama, they seem, upon the whole, to be the fullest expression of his genius, and that for which he is likeliest to be remembered. Every poet has limitations, and in such briefer studies Browning keeps within the narrowest bounds allotted to him. Very few of his best pieces are in \" Dramatis Per son\u00e6,\" the greater part of which book is made up of his most ragged, uncouth, and even puerile verse ; and it is curious that it appeared at a time when his wife was scribbling the rhetorical verse of those years which I have designated as her period of decline. But observe the general excellence of the fifty poems in \" Men and Women,\" \u2014 collected nine years earlier, when the author was forty years old, and at his prime. In the chapter upon Tennyson it was stated that almost every poet has a represen tative book, showing him at full height and variety. \" Men and Women,\" like the Laureate's volume of 1842, is the most finished and comprehensive of the"], [73, "Robert Browning. 47 author's works, and the one his readers least could spare. Here we find numbers of those thrilling, skilfully dramatic studies, which so many have imi tated without catching the secret of their power. The general effect of Browning's miscellaneous poems is like that of a picture-gallery, where cabi net paintings, by old and modern masters, are placed at random upon the walls. Some are rich in color ; others, strong in light and shade. A few are elabora tely finished, \u2014 more are careless drawings, fresh, but hurriedly sketched in. Often the subjects are re pulsive, but occasionally we have the solitary, im pressive figure of a lover or a saint. The poet is as familiar with medi\u00e6val thought and story as most authors with their own time, and adapts them to his lyrical uses. \" Andrea del Sarto\" belongs to the same group with \" My Last Duchess.\" It is the language of \" the faultless painter,\" address ed to his beautiful and thoughtless wife, for whom he has lowered his ideal \u2014 and from whose chains he cannot break, though he knows she is unworthy, and even false to him. He moans before one of"], [74, "48 Robert Browning. Raphael's drawings, excusing the faults, in envy of the genius : \u2014 \u25a0 \"Still, what an arm ! and I could alter it. But all the play, the insight and the stretch \u2014 Out of me ! out of me ! And wherefore out ? Had you enjoined them on me, given me soul, We might have risen to Raphael, I and you. But had you \u2014 O, with the same perfect brow, And perfect eyes, and more than perfect mouth, And the low voice my soul hears, as a bird The fowler's pipe, and follows to the snare, \u2014 Had you, with these the same, but brought a mind ! Some women do so. Had the mouth there urged ' God and the glory ! never care for gain ! ' I might have done it for you.\" Were it indeed \"all for love,\" then were the \"world well lost \"; but even while he dallies with his wife she listens for her gallant's signal. This poem is one of Browning's finest studies : of late he has given us nothing equal to it. The picture of the rollicking \" Fra Lippo Lippi \" is broad, free handed, yet scarcely so well done. \" Pictor Igno tus \" is upon another art-theme, and in quiet beauty"], [75, "Robert Browning. 49 differs from the poet's usual manner. Other old time studies, good and poor, which served to set the fashion for a number of minor poets, are such pieces as \" Count Gismond,\" \" Cristina,\" \" The Laboratory,\" and \" The Confessional.\" How perilous an easy rhymed -metre is to this author was discernible in \" Sordello.\" After the same manner he is tempted to garrulity in the semi religious poems, \" Christmas Eve \" and \" Easter Day.\" It is difficult otherwise to account for their dreary flow, since they are no more original in theology than poetical in language and design. It would be strange if Browning were not indebted, for some of his most powerful themes, to the superstition from which medi\u00e6val art, politics, and daily life took their prevailing tone. In his analysis of its quality he seems to me extremely profound. Monasticism in Spain even now is not so different from that of the fifteenth century, and the repulsive imagery of a piece like the \" Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister,\" written in the harshest verse, well consorts with a period when the orders, 4"], [76, "Robert Brcnvning. 50 that took their origin in exalted purity, had become degraded through lust, gluttony, jealousy, and every cardinal sin. Browning draws his monks, as Dore in the illustrations to \" Les Contes Drolatiques,\" with porcine or wolfish faces, monstrous, seamed with vice, defiled in body and soul. \" The Bishop orders his Tomb \" has been criticised as not being a faithful study of the Romish ecclesiastic, A. D. 15 \u2014 ; but, unless I misapprehend the spirit of that period, this is one of the poet's strongest portrai tures. Religion then was often a compound of fear, bigotry, and greed ; its officers, trained in the Church, seemed to themselves invested with some thing greater than themselves ; their ideas of good and evil, after years of ritualistic service, \u2014 made gross with pelf, jealousy, sensualism, and even blood-guiltiness, \u2014 became strangely intermixed. The poet overlays this groundwork with that love of art and luxury \u2014 of jasper, peach-blossom marble, and lazuli \u2014 inbred in every Italian, \u2014 and even with the scholar's desire to have his epitaph carved aright : \u2014"], [77, "Robert Browning. 51 \" Choice Latin, picked phrase, Tully's every word, No gaudy ware like Gandolfs second line, \u2014 Tully, my masters ? Ulpian serves his need ! And then how I shall lie through centuries. And hear the blessed mutter of (he mass, And see God made and eaten all day long, And feel the steady candle flame, and taste Good, strong, thick, stupefying incense-smoke ! \" All this commanded to his bastards ! And for the rest, were ever suspicion, hatred, delight at outwit ting a rival in love and preferment, and every other loathsome passion strong in death, more ruthlessly and truthfully depicted ? Of strictly medi\u00e6val church studies, \" The Her etic's Tragedy \" and \" Holy-Cross Day,\" with their grotesque diction, annotations, and prefixes, are the most skilful reproductions essayed in our time. Browning alone could have conceived or written them. In \" A Grammarian's Funeral,\" \" Abt Vog ler,\" and \" Master Hugues,\" early scholarship and music are commemorated. The language of the simplest of these is so intricate that we have to be educated in a new tongue to comprehend them."], [78, "52 Robert Browning. Their value lies in the human nature revealed under such fantastic, and, to us, unnatural aspects devel oped in other times. \" Artemis Prologuizes,\" the poet's antique sketch, is as unclassical as one might expect from its affected title. \" Saul,\" a finer poem, may have fur nished hints to Swinburne with respect to anapestic verse and the Hebraic feeling. Three poems, which strive to reproduce the early likeness and spirit of Christianity, merit close attention. One describes the raising of Lazarus, narrated in an \" Epistle of Karshish, the Arab Physician.\" The pious, learned mage sees in the miracle But a case of mania \u2014 subinduced By epilepsy, at the turning-point Of trance prolonged unduly some three days. \" \" Cleon \" is an exposition of the highest ground reached by the Pagan philosophy, set forth in a letter written, by a wise poet, to Protos, the King. At the end he makes light of the preachings of Paul, who is welcome to the few proselytes he can make among the ignorant slaves ; \u2014"], [79, "Robert Browning. 53 \" And (as I gathered from a bystander) Their doctrines could be held by no sane man. The reader is forced to stop and consider what despised doctrines even now may be afloat, which in time may constitute the whole world's creed. The most elaborate of these pieces is \" A Death in the Desert,\" the last words of St. John, the Evangelist, recorded by Pamphylax, an Antiochene martyr. The prologue and epilogue are sufficiently pedantic, but, like the long-drawn narrative, so characteristic, that this curious production may be taken as a representative poem. A similar bit of realism is the sketch of a great poet, seen in every-day life by a fellow-townsman, entitled, \" How it Strikes a Contemporary.\" And now, having selected a few of these miscellaneous pieces to represent the mass, how shall we define their true value, and their influence upon recent art ? Browning is justified in offering such works as a substitute for poetic treatment of English themes, since he is upon ground naturally his own. Yet as poems they fail to move us, and to gloriously elevate"], [80, "Robert Broicning. 54 the soul, but are the outgrowth of minute realism and speculation. To quote from one who is reviewing a kindred sort of literature, they sin, \" against the spirit of antiquity, in carrying back the modern analytic feeling to a scene where it does not belong.\" It is owing precisely to this sin that several of Browning's longer works are literary and rhythmical prodigies, monuments of learning and labor rather than ennobling efforts of the imagina tion. His hand is burdened by too great accumu lation of details, \u2014 and then there is the ever-pres ent spirit of Robert Browning peering from the eyes of each likeness, however faithful, that he portrays. He is the most intellectual of poets, Tennyson not excepted. Take, for example, \" Caliban,\" with its text, \"Thou thoughtestl was altogether such an one as thyself.\" The motive is a study of anthropo morphism, by reflection of its counterpart in a lower animal, half man, half beast, possessed of the faculty of speech. The \" natural theology \" is food for thought ; the poetry, descriptive and otherwise,"], [81, "Robert Browning. 55 realism carried to such perfection as to seem imagin ation. Here we have Browning's curious reasoning at its best. But what can be more vulgar and strictly unpoetical than \" Mr. Sludge, the Medium,\" a composition of the same period ? Our familiarity with such types as those to which the author's method is here applied enables us to test it with any thing but satisfaction. Applied to a finer subject, in \"Bishop Blougram's Apology,\" we heartily admire its virile analysis of the motives actuating the great prelate, who after due reflection has rejected \" A life of doubt diversified by faith For one of faith diversified by doubt. Cardinal Wiseman is worldly and insincere ; the poet, Gigadibs, is earnest and on the right side ; yet, somehow, we do not quite despise the churchman nor admire the poet. This piece is at once the foremost defence and arraignment of Philistinism, drawn up by a thinker broad enough to comprehend both sides. As an intellectual work, it is meat and"], [82, "56 Robert Browning. wine ; as a poem, as a thing of beauty, \u2014 but that is quite another point in issue. Browning's offhand, occasional lyrics, such as \"Waring,\" \"Time's Revenges,\" \"Up in a Villa,\" \" The Italian in England,\" \" By theFireside,\" \" The Worst of It,\" etc., are suggestive, and some of them widely familiar. His style has been caught by others. The picturesqueness and easy rhythm of \" The Flight of the Duchess,\" and the touches in briefer lyrics, are repeated by minnesingers like Owen Meredith and Dobell. There is a grace and turn that still evades them, for sometimes their mas ter can be as sweet and tuneful as Lodge, or any other of the skylarks. Witness \" In a Gondola,\" that delicious Venetian cantata, full of music and sweet sorrow, or \" One Way of Love,\" for example, \u2014 but such melodies are none too frequent. When he paints nature, as in \"Home Thoughts, from Abroad,\" how fresh and fine the landscape ! \"And after April, when May follows, And the white-throat builds, and all the swallows, \u2014 Hark ! where my blossomed pear-tree in the hedge"], [83, "Robert Browning. 57 Leans to the field and scatters on the clover Blossoms, and dew-drops \u2014 at the bent spray's edge \u2014 That's the wise thrush ; he sings each song twice over Lest you should think he never could recapture The first fine careless rapture ! \" Having in mind Shakespeare and Shelley, I never theless think the last three lines the finest ever writ ten touching the song of a bird. Contrast there with the poet's later method, \u2014 the prose-run-mad of stanzas such as this : \u2014 ' ' Hobbs hints blue, \u2014 si raight he turtle eats. Nobbs prints blue, \u2014 claret crowns his cup. Nokes outdares Stokes in azure feats, \u2014 Both gorge. Who fished the murex up ? What porridge had John Keats ? \" And this by no means the most impertinent of kindred verses in his books, \u2014 poetry that neither gods nor men can endure or understand, and yet interstrewn with delicate trifles, such as \" Mem orabilia,\" which for suggestiveness long will be preserved. Who so deft to catch the one immortal moment, the fleeting exquisite word ? Who so wont to reach for it, and wholly fail ?"], [84, "Robert Browning. 58 VI. We come, at last, to a class of Browning's poems that I have grouped for their expression of that dominating sentiment, to which reference was made at the beginning of this review. Their moral is that of the apothegm that \" Attractions are propor tional to destinies \" ; of rationalistic freedom, as opposed to Calvinism ; of a belief that the greatest sin does not consist in giving rein to our desires, but in stinting or too prudently repressing them. Life must have its full and free development. And, as love is the master-passion, he is most earnest in illustrating this belief from its good or evil progress, and to this end has composed his most impressive verse. A main lesson of Browning's emotional poetry is that the unpardonable sin is \" to dare something against nature.\" To set bounds to love is to com mit that sin. Through his instinct for conditions which engender the most dramatic forms of speech and action, he is, at least, as an artist, tolerant of"], [85, "Robert Browning. 59 what is called an intrigue ; and that many com placent English and American readers do not recog nize this, speaks volumes either for their stupidity, or for their hypocrisy and inward sympathy in a creed which they profess to abhor. Affecting to comprehend and admire Browning, they still refuse to forgive Swinburne, \u2014 whose crude earlier poems brought the lust of the flesh to the edge of a gross ness too palpable to be seductive, and from which his riper manhood has departed altogether. The elder poet, from first to last, has appeared to defend the elective affinities against impediments of law theology, or social rank. It is not my province to discuss the ethics of this matter, but simply to speak of it as a fact. It will not do to fall back upon Browning's pro test, in the note to his \" Dramatic Lyrics,\" that these are \" so many utterances of so many imaginary persons,\" and not his own. For when he returns persistently to a certain theme, illustrates it in divers ways, and heaps the coals of genius upon it till it breaks out into flame, he ceases to be objective"], [86, "Robert Browning. 60 and reveals his secret thought. No matter how conservative his habit, he is to be judged, like any artist, by his work ; and in all his poems we see a taste for the joys and sorrows of a free, irresponsible life, \u2014 like that of the Italian lovers, of students in their vagrant youth, or of Consuelo and her hus band upon the windy heath. Above all, he tells us \"Thou shalt know, those arms once curled About thee, what we knew before. How love is the only good in the world.\" \" In a Balcony \" is the longest and finest of his emotional poems : a dramatic episode, in three dia logues, the personages of which talk at too great length, \u2014 although, no doubt, many and varied thoughts flash through the mind at supreme moments, and it is Browning's custom to put them all upon the record. How clearly the story is wrought ! What exquisite language, and passion triumphant over life and death ! Mark the trans formation of the lonely queen, in the one radiant hour of her life that tells her she is beloved, and"], [87, "Robert Browning. 61 makes her an angel of goodness and light. She barters power and pride for love, clutching at this one thing as at Heaven, and feels '* How soon a smile of God can change the world,\" Then comes the transformation, upon discovery of the cruel deceit, \u2014 her vengeance and despair. The love of Constance, who for it will surrender life, and even Norbert's hand, is more unselfish ; never more subtly, perhaps, than in this poem, has been illustrated Byron's epigram ; \u2014 \" In her first passion, woman loves her lover In all the others, all she loves is love.\" Here, too, is the profound lesson of the whole, that a word of the man Norbert's simple, blunder ing truth would have prevented all this coil. But the poet is at his height in treating of the master passion : \u2014 \" Remember, I (and what am I to you ? ) Would give up all for one, leave throne, lose life, Do alt but just unlove him ! he loves me. \""], [88, "62 Robert Bro7uning. With fine abandonment he makes the real worth so much more than the ideal : \u2014 \" We live, and they experiment on life, These poets, painters, all who stand aloof To overlook the farther. Let us be The thing they look at ! \" But in a large variety of minor lyrics it is hinted that our instincts have something divine about them ; that, regardless of other obligations, we may not disobey the inward monition. A man not only may forsake father and mother and cleave to his wife ; but forsake his wife and cleave to the pre destined one. No sin like repression ; no sting like regret ; no requital for the opportunity slighted and gone by. In \"The Statue and the Bust,\"\u2014 a typi cal piece, \u2014 had the man and woman seen clearly \" the end \" of life, though \" a crime,\" they had not so failed of it : \u2014 \" If you choose to play \u2014 is my principle ! Let a man contend to the uttermost For his life's set prize, be it what it will !"], [89, "Robert Browning. 63 \" The counter our lovers staked was lost As surely as if it were lawful coin : And the sin I impute to each frustrate ghost \" Was, the unlit lamp and the ungirt loin. Though the end in sight was a crime, I say.\" \" A Light Woman \" turns upon the right of every soul, however despicable, to its own happiness, and to freedom from the meddling of others. The words of many lyrics, attesting the boundless liberty and sovereignty of love, are plainly written, and to say the lesson is not there is to ape those commenta tors who discover an allegorical meaning in each Scriptural text that interferes with their special creeds. Both Browning and his wife possessed by nature a radical gift for sifting things to the core, an heroic disregard of every conventional gloss or institution. They were thoroughly mated in this respect, though one may have outstripped the other in exercise of the faculty. Their union, apparently, was so absolute that neither felt any need of fuller emotional life. The sentiment of Browning's pas-"], [90, ". Robert Browning. 64 sional verse, therefore, is not the outgrowth of per ceptions sharpened by restraint. The poetry addressed to his wife is, if anything, of a still high er order. He watches her \" Reading by firelight, that great brow And the spirit-small hand propping it Mutely \u2014 my heart knows how \u2014 \" When, if I think but deep enough, You are wont to answer, prompt as rhyme\"; and again and again addresses her in such lines as these : \u2014 \" God be thanked, the meanest of his creatures Boasts two soul-sides, one to face the world with, One to show a woman when he loves her. This to you \u2014 - yourself my moon of poets ! Ah, but that's the world's side \u2014 there's the wonder \u2014 Thus they see you, praise you, think they know you.\" In fine, not only his passional lyrics, but all the poems relating to the wedded love in which his own deepest instincts were thoroughly gratified, are the most strong and simple portion of his verse, \u2014 show-"], [91, "Robert Browning. 65 ing that luminous expression is still the product of high emotion, as some conceive the diamond to vave been crystallized by the electric shock. VII. Many of the lyrics in the volume of 1864* are so thin and faulty, and so fail to carry out the author's intent, \u2014 the one great failure in art, \u2014 as sadly to illustrate the progressive ills which attend upon a wrong method. The gift still remained, however, for no work dis plays more of ill-diffused power and swift applica tion than Browning's longest poem, The Ring and the Book. It has been succeeded rapidly, within five years, by other works, \u2014 \u25a0 the whole almost equalling, in bulk, the entire volume of his former writings. Their special quality is affluence : limit less wealth of language and illustration. They abound in the material of poetry. A poet should condense from such star-dust the orbs which give light and outlast time. As in \"Sordello,\" Browning * ' ' Dramatis Persona:. \" 5"], [92, "66 Robert Browning. again fails to do this ; he gives us his first draught, \u2014 the huge, outlined block, yet to be reduced to fit proportions, \u2014 the painter's sketch, blotchy and too obscure, and of late without the early freshness. Nevertheless, \"The Ring and the Book \"is a wonderful production, the extreme of realistic art, and considered, not without reason, by the poet's admirers, to be his greatest work. To review it would require a special chapter, and I have said enough with respect to the author's style in my cita tion of his less extended poems ; but as the product of sheer intellect this surpasses them all. It is the story of a tragedy which took place at Rome one hundred and seventy years ago. The poet seems to have found his thesis in an old book,- \u2014 part print, part manuscript, \u2014 bought for eight pence at a Flo rence stall : \u2022 \u2014 A book in shape, but, really, pure crude fact Secreted from man's life when hearts beat hard, And brains, high-blooded, ticked two centuries since.\" The versified narrative of the child Pampilia's sale to Count Guido, of his cruelty and violence, of her"], [93, "Robert Browning. 67 rescue by a young priest, \u2014 the pursuit, the lawful separation, the murder by Guido of the girl and her putative parents, the trial and condemnation of the murderer, and the affirmation of his sentence by the Pope, \u2014 all this is made to fill out a poem of twenty one thousand lines ; but these include ten different versions of the same tale, besides the poet's prelude, \u2014 in which latter he gives a general outline of it, so that the reader plainly may understand it, and the historian then be privileged to wander as he choose. The chapters which contain the statements of the priest-lover and Pampilia are full of tragic beauty and emotion ; the Pope's soliloquy, though too pro longed, is a wonderful piece of literary metempsy chosis ; but the speeches of the opposing lawyers carry realism to an intolerable, prosaic extreme. Each of these books, possibly, should be read by itself, and not too steadily nor too often. Observe that the author, in elevated passages, sometimes for gets his usual manner and breaks into the cadences of Tennyson's style ; for instance, the apostrophe to his dead wife, beginning"], [94, "68 Robert Browning. ' O lyric Love, half angel and half bird, And all a wonder and a wild desire ! \" But elsewhere he leads the reaction frc>m the art school. His presentations are endless : in his architecture the tracery, scroll-work, and multifoil bewilder us and divert attention from the main design. Yet in presence of the changeful flow of his verse, and the facility wherewith he records the speculations of his various characters, we are struck with wonder. \" The Ring and the Book \" is thus far imaginative, and a rhythmical marvel, but is it a stronghold of poetic art ? As a whole, we cannot admit that it is ; and yet the thought, the vocab ulary, imagery, the wisdom, lavished upon this story, would equip a score of ordinary writers, and place them beyond danger of neglect. Balaustions Adventure, the poet's next volume, displays a tranquil beauty uncommon in his verse, and it seems as if he sought, after his most prolonged effort, to refresh his mind with the sweetness and repose of Greek art. He treads decently and rever ently in the buskins of Euripides, and forgets to be"], [95, "Robert Browning. 69 garrulous in his chaste semi-translation of the Alces tis. The girl Balaustion's prelude and conclusion are very neatly turned, reminding us of Landor ; nor does the book, as a whole, lack the antique flavor and the blue, laughing freshness of the Trin acrian sea. What shall be said of Fijine at the Fair, or of that volume, the last but one of Browning's essays, which not long ago succeeded it ? Certainly, that they exhibit his steadfast tendency to produce work that is less and less poetical. There is no harder reading than the first of these poems ; no more badly chosen, rudely handled measure than the verse selected for it ; no pretentious work, from so great a pen, has less of the spirit of grace and comeliness. It is a pity that the author has not somewhat accustomed himself to write in prose, for he insists upon recording all of his thoughts, and many of them are essentially prosaic. Strength and subtilty are not enough in art : beauty, either of the fair, the terrible, or the grotesque, is its justifi cation, and a poem that repels at the outset has"], [96, "Robert Browning. 70 small excuse for being. \" Prince Hohenstiel-Schwan gau, Savior of Society,\" is another of Browning's experiments in vivisection, the subject readily made out to be the late Emperor of the French. It is longer than \" Bishop Blougram's Apology,\" but compare it therewith, and we are forced to perceive a decline in terseness, virility, and true imaginative power. Red Cotton Night-Cap Country; or, Turf and Towers, \u2014 what exasperating titles Browning puts forth ! this time under the protection of Miss Thack eray. That the habit is inbred, however, is proved by some absurd invention whenever it becomes necessary to coin a proper name. After \" Blup hocks\" and \"Gigadibs,\" we have no right to com plain of the title of his Breton romance. The poem itself contains a melo-dramatic story, and hence is less uninteresting than \" Fifine.\" But to have such a volume, after Browning's finer works, come out with each revolving year, is enough to ex tort from his warmest admirers the cry of \" Words ! Words ! Words !\" Much of the detail is paltry,"], [97, "Robert Browning. 71 and altogether local or temporal, so that it will be come inexplicable fifty years hence. There is a constant \" dropping into \" prose ; moreover, whole pages of wandering nonsense are called forth by some word, like \" night-cap \" or \" fiddle,\" taken for a text, as if to show the poet's mastery of verse building and how contemptible he can make it. Once he would have put the narrative of this poem into a brief dramatic sketch that would have had beauty and interest. \" My Last Duchess \" is a more genuine addition to literature than the two hundred pages of this tedious and affected romance. A pro longed career has not been of advantage to the reputation of Browning : his tree was well-rooted and reached a sturdy growth, but the yield is too profuse, of a fruit that still grows sourer from year to year. Nevertheless, this poet, like all men of genius, has happy seasons in which, by some remarkable per formance, he seems to renew his prime. Aristopha nes' Apology continues the charm of \"Balaustion's Adventure,\" to which poem it is a sequel. What I"], [98, "Robert Browning. 72 have said of the classical purity and sweetness of the earlier production will apply to portions of \" the last adventure of Balaustion,\" \u2014 which also includes \" a transcript from Euripides.\" Besides, it displays the richness of scholarship, command of learned details, skill in sophistry and analysis, power to re call, awaken, and dramatically inform the historic past, in all which qualifications this master still remains unequalled by any modern writer, even by the most gifted and affluent pupil of his own impres sive school. VIII. A fair estimate of Browning may, I think, be de duced from the foregoing review of his career. It is hard to speak of one whose verse is a metrical paradox. I have called him the most original and the most unequal of living poets ; he continually descends to a prosaic level, but at times is elevated to the Laureate's highest flights. Without realizing the proper function of art, he nevertheless sympa thizes with the joyous liberty of its devotees ; his"], [99, "Robert Browning. 73 life may be conventional, but he never forgets the Latin Quarter, and often celebrates that freedom in love and song which is the soul of Beranger's \" Dans un grenier qu'on est bien a vingt ans.\" then, too, what working man of letters does not thank him when he says, \u2014 \" But you are of the trade, my Puccio ! You have the fellow-craftsman's sympathy. There's none knows like a fellow of the craft The all unestimated sum of pains That go to a success the world can see. \" He is an Eclectic, and will not be restricted in his themes ; on the other hand, he gives us too gross a mixture of poetry, fact, and metaphysics, appearing to have no sense of composite harmony, but to revel in arabesque strangeness and confusion. He has a barbaric sense of color and lack of form. Striving against the trammels of verse, he really is far less a master of expression than others who make less resistance. We read in \" Pippa Passes\": \" If there should arise a new painter, will it not be in some"], [100, "Robert Browning. 74 such way by a poet, now, or a musician (spirits who have conceived and perfected an Ideal through some other channel), transferring it to this, and escaping our conventional roads by pure ignorance of them?\" This is the Pre-Raphaelite idea, and, so far, good ; but Browning's fault is that, if he has \"conceived,\" he certainly has made no effort to \" perfect \" an Ideal. And here I wish to say, \u2014 and this is something which, soon or late, every thoughtful poet must dis cover, \u2014 \u25a0 that the structural exigencies of art, if one adapts his genius to them, have a beneficent reac tion upon the artist's original design. By some friendly law they help the work to higher excellence, suggesting unthought-of touches, and refracting, so to speak, the single beam of light in rays of varied and delightful beauty. The brakes which art applies to the poet's move ment not only regulate, but strengthen its progress. Their absence is painfully evinced by the mass of Browning's unread verse. Works like \" Sordello \" and \" Fifine,\" however intellectual, seem, like the"], [101, "Robert Browning. 75 removal of the Malvern Hills, a melancholy waste of human power. When some romance like the last-named comes from his pen, \u2014 an addition in volume, not in quality, to what he has done before, \u2014 I feel a sadness like that engendered among hun dreds of gloomy folios in some black-letter alcove : books, forever closed, over which the mighty monks of old wore out their lives, debating minute points of casuistic theology, though now the very memory of their discussions has passed away. Would that Browning might take to heart his own words, addressed, in \" Transcendentalism,\" to a brother poet : \u2014 \" Song's our art : Whereas you please to speak these naked thoughts Instead of draping them in sights and sounds. \u2014 True thoughts, good thoughts, thoughts fit to treasure up ! But why such long prolusion and display, Such turning and adjustment of the harp ? But here's your fault; grown men want thought, you think ; Thought's what they mean by verse, and seek in verse : Boys seek for images and melody, Men must have reason, \u2014 so you aim at men. Quite otherwise !\""], [102, "76 Robert Browning. Incidentally we have noted the distinction be tween the drama of Browning and that of the abso lute kind, observing that his characters reflect his own mental traits, and that their action and emotion are of small moment compared with the speculations to which he makes them all give voice. Still, he has dramatic insight, and a minute power of reading other men's hearts. His moral sentiment has a potent and subtile quality : \u2014 -through his early poems he really founded a school, and had imitators, and although of his later method there are none, the younger poets whom he has most affected very naturally began work by carrying his philosophy to a startling yet perfectly logical extreme. Much of his poetry is either very great or very poor. It has been compared to Wagner's music, and entitled the \" poetry of the future ;\" but if this be just, then we must revise our conception of what poetry really is. The doubter incurs the contempt uous enmity of two classes of the dramatist's admirers : first, of the metaphysical, who disregard considerations of passion, melody, and form ;"], [103, "Robert Browning. 77 secondly, of those who are sensitive to their mas ter's failings, but, in view of his greatness, make it a point of honor to defend them. That greatness lies in his originality ; his error, arising from per verseness or congenital defect, is the violation of natural and beautiful laws. This renders his longer poems of less worth than his lyrical studies, while, through avoidance of it, productions, differing as widely as \" The Eve of St. Agnes,\" and \" In Mem oriam,\" will outlive \" The Ring and the Book.\" In writing of Arnold I cited his own quotation of Goethe's distinction between the dilettanti, who affect genius and despise art, and those who respect their calling though not gifted with high creative power.
