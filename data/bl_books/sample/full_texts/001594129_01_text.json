A STEEET IN ANGLEBURY \u2014 A HEATH NEAR \u2014 INSIDE THE ' OLD FOX INN.' Young Mrs. Petherwin stepped from the door of an old though popular inn in a Wessex tOAvn to take a country walk. By her look and carriage she appeared to belong to that gentle order of society Avhich has no Avorldly sorrow except Avhen its jeAvellery gets stolen ; but, as a fact not generally known, her claim to dis tinction was rather one of brains than of blood. She Avas a respectable butler's daughter, and began life as a baby christened Ethelberta after an iufant of title Avho does not come into the story at all, ha\\-ing merely furnished to Ethelberta's mother a means of occupying herself as head nurse.

He, a minor hke herself, died from a chill caught during the Aved ding torn, and a feAV weeks later Avas followed into the grave by Sir Ealph Pethenvin, his unforgiving father, who had bequeathed his wealth to his wife absolutely. These calamities Avere a sufficient reason to Lady Pethenvin for pardoning all concerned. She took by the hand the forlorn Ethelberta \u2014 Avho seemed rather a detached bride than a widoAv \u2014 and finished her educa tion by placing her for two or three years in a board ing-school at Bonn. Latterly she had brought the girl to England to live under her roof as daughter and companion, the condition attached being that Ethel berta was never openly to recognise her poor relations. The elegant young lady, as she had a full right to be called if she cared for the definition, arrested all the local attention AA-hen she emerged into the summer evening light Avith that diadem-and-sceptre bearing \u2014 many people for reasons of heredity discovering sucli graces only in those Avhose vestibules are lined Avitli ancestral mail, forgetting that a bear may be taught to dance. While this air of hers lasted, even the inani mate objects in the street appeared to know that she was there ; but from a Avay she had of carelessly over throAving her dignity by versatile moods, one could not"], [17, "TIIE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 3 calculate upon its presence to a certainty Avhen she Avas round corners or in little lanes which demanded no repression of animal spirits.

' The speaker, avIio had been carrying a pair of pails on a yoke, deposited them upon the edge of the pave ment in front of the inn, and straightened his back to an excruciating perpendicular. His remarks had been addressed to a rickety person, Avearing a waistcoat of that preternatural length from the top to the bottom button which prevails among men Avho haA-e to do with horses. He was SAveeping straws from the carriage way beneath the stone arch that formed a passage to the stables behind. ' Never mind the cursing and swearing, or some- body Avho's never out of hearing may clap yer name doAvn in his black book afore you knoAv it,' said tlie hostler, also pausing, and lifting his eyes to the mul lioned and transomed AvindoAvs and moulded parapet above him \u2014 not to study them as features of ancient architecture, but just to give as healthful a stretch to the eyes as his acquaintance had done to his back.

Pouncing upon young flesh hke a carrion crow \u2014 'tis a vile thino- in a old man.' ' 'Tis, and yet 'tis not, for 'tis a naterel taste,' said the milkman, again surveying Ethelberta, Avho had now paused upon a bridge in full view, to look down the river. ' Now, if a poor needy feller like myself coidd only catch her alone when she's dressed up to the nines for some grand party, and carry her off to some lonely place \u2014 sakes, Avhat a pot of jeAvels and goold things I Avarrant he'd find about her !

'Who's that chap in the gaiters and pack at his back, come out of the door but now ? ' said the milk man, nodding toAvards a figure of that description who had just emerged from the inn and trudged off in the direction taken by the lady \u2014 now out of sight. ' Chap in the gaiters ? Chok' it all\u2014 why the father of that nobleman that you call chap in the gaiters used to be hand in glove with half the Queen's court.' ' What d'ye tell o'?'

'Night t'ee, hostler, I must moA\"e too,' said the milkman, shouldering his yoke, and walking off; and there reached the inn in a gradual diminuendo, as he receded up the street, shaking his head convulsively, ' More knoAv \u2014 Tom fool \u2014 than Tom fool \u2014 ho-ho-ho ho-ho!' The ' Old Fox,' as the inn or hotel was called Avhich of late years had become the fashion among tourists, because of the absence from its precincts of all that Avas fashionable and new, stood on the border of the town without having been built there. In the course of time houses had been pulled doAvn at one end of the place, and new ones erected at the other, which lay toAvards the railway station : thus the inn had passed from middle to outside in consequence of its sheer uuchangeableness, just as in the mobility of parties a consistent man of long life may, somewhat to his sur prise, be a person of advanced views in youth and of retrograde principles in old age, by the mere fact of remaining just the same."], [23, "9 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. Standing now as the northern bulwark of the toAvn, the hostel formed a corner Avhere in winter the winds whistled and assembled their forces previous to plung ing helter-skelter along the streets. In summer it was a fresh and pleasant spot, convenient for such quiet characters as sojourned there to study the geology and beautiful natural features of the country round. The lady whose appearance had asserted a diffe rence between herself and the Anglebury people, with out too clearly shoAving what that difference was, passed out of the high-road in a few moments after leaving the bridge, and she soon got into a lonely valley, Avhich, at its further end, spread out into a flat heath. She had walked to the beginning of this dead level, Avatching the base of a cloud as it closed down upon the line of a distant ridge, like an upper upon a lower eyelid, shutting in the gaze of the evening sun. She Avas about to return before dusk came on, when she heard a commotion in the air immediately behind and above her head. The saunterer looked up and saw a Avild-duck flying along with the greatest violence, just in its rear being another large bird, Avhich a country man would have pronounced to be one of the biggest duck-hawks that he had ever beheld. The hawk neared its intended victim, and the duck screamed and re doubled its efforts. Ethelberta impulsively started off in a rapid run that would have made a little dog bark with delight"], [24, "10 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. and run after, her object being, if possible, to see the end of this desperate struggle for a life so small and unheard-of. Her stateliness went away, and it could be forgiven for not remaining ; for her feet suddenly became as quick as fingers, and she raced along over the uneven ground with such force of tread that, being a woman slightly heavier than gossamer, her patent heels punched little D's in the soil with unerring accuracy Avherever it was bare, crippled the heather twigs where it Avas not, and sucked the swampy places with a sound of quick kisses. Her rate of advance was not to be compared with that of the two birds, though she went swiftly enough to keep them well in sight in such an open place as that around her, having at one point in the journey been so near that she could hear the whisk of the duck's feathers against the wind as it lifted and lowered its wings. When the bird seemed to be but a few yards from its enemy she saw it strike downwards, and after a level flight of a quarter of a minute, vanish. The haAvk swooped after, and Ethelberta iioav perceived a Avhitely shining oval of still water, looking amid the swarthy level of the heath like a hole through to a nether sky. Into this large pond, which the duck had been making towards from the beginning of its precipitate flight, it had dived out of sight. The excited and breathless runner Avas in a feAV moments close enough"], [25, "THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 11 to see the disappointed haAvk hovering and floating in the air as if Avaiting for the reappearance of its prey, upon which grim pastime it was so intent that by creeping along softly she AA-as enabled to get very near tlie edge of the pool and Avitness clearly the conclusion of the episode. Whenever the duck Avas under the necessity of shoAving its head to breathe, the other bird would dart towards it, invariably too late, hoAvever ; for the diver Avas far too experienced in the rough humour of the buzzard family at this game to come up tAvice near the same spot, unaccountably emerging from opposite sides of the pool in succession, and bobbing again by the time its adversary reached each place ; so that at length the hawk gave up the contest and fleAV away, a satanic moodiness being almost perceptible in the motion of its Avings. o' The young lady now looked around her for the first time, ancl began to perceive that she had rim a long distance \u2014 very much farther than she had origi nally intended to come. Her eyes had been so long fixed upon the haAA'k, as it soared against the bright and mottled field of sky, that on regarding the heather and plain again it was as if she had returned to a half forgotten region after an absence, and the Avhole pros pect Avas darkened to one uniform shade of approach ing night. She began at once to retrace her steps, but O O t_> *\u25a0 having been indiscriminately Avheeling round the pond to get a good vieAv of the performance, and having"], [26, "12 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. folloAved no path thither, she found the proper direction of her journey to be a matter of some uncertainty. ' Surely,' she said to herself, ' I faced the Avest at starting : ' and yet on Avalking uoav with her back where her face had been set, she did not approach the notch in the horizon Avhich Avas all that remained of the valley by the tOAvn. Thus dubiously, but with little real concern, she Avalked on till the evening lights began to turn to dusk, and the shadows to darkness. Presently in front of her Ethelberta saAV a Avhite spot in the shade, and it proved to be in some way attached to tlie head of a man Avho Avas coining toAvards her out of a slight depression iii the ground. It was as yet too early in the evening to be afraid, but it was too late to be altogether courageous ; and Avith balanced sensations Ethelberta kept her eye sharply upon him as he rose by degrees into view. The peculiar arrange ment of his hat and pugree soon struck her as being the same that she had casually noticed hanging on a peg in one of the rooms of the ' Old Fox ' the night before, and Avhen he came close she saw that his arms diminished to a peculiar smallness at their junction Avith his shoulders, like those of a doll, a phenomenon Avhich Avas explained by then- being girt round at that point with the straps of a knapsack that he carried behind him. Encouraged by the probability that he, like her self, Avas staying or had been staying at the ' Old Fox,'"], [27, "THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 13 she said, ' Can you tell me if this is the way back to Anglebury?' ' It is one way ; but the nearest is in this direction,' said the tourist \u2014 the same who had been criticised by the tAvo old men. At hearing him speak all the delicate activities in the young lady's person stood still : she stopped like a clock. When she could again fence with the perception Avhich had caused all this, she breathed. ' Mr. Juliau ! ' she exclaimed. The Avords Avere uttered in a Avay Avhich Avould have told anybody in a moment that here lay something connected Avith the light of other days. ' Ah, Mrs. Pethenvin ! \u2014 Yes, I am Mr. Julian \u2014 though that can matter very little, I should think, after all these years, and what has passed.' No remark Avas returned to this rugged reply, and he continued unconcernedly, ' Shall I put you in the path \u2014 it is just here ? ' ' If you please.' ' Come Avith me, then.' She walked in silence at his heels, not a word passing betAveen them all the Avay : the only noises Avhich came from the tAvo were the brushing of her dress and his gaiters against the heather, or the smart rap of a stray flint against his boot. They had now reached a little knoll, and he turned abruptly : ' That is Anglebury\u2014 just Avhere you see"], [28, "14 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. those lights. The path cIoavii there is the one you must folio av : it leads round the hill yonder and directly into the town.' ' Thank you,' she murmured, and found that he had never removed his eyes from her since speaking, keeping them fixed with mathematical exactness upon one point in her face. She moved a little to go on her way ; he moA-ed a httle less \u2014 to go on his. ' Good night,' said Mr. Julian. The moment, upon the very face of it, Avas critical ; and yet it AAras one of those which have to wait for a future before they acquire a definite character as good or bad. We often figure in junctures about AA-hich Ave can foresee that ' 0 that time ! ' will some day lie our habitual thought, even while we do not at all foresee the tone, bright or mournful, that the thought will Avear. Thus much Avould have been obvious to any out sider ; it may have been doubly so to Ethelberta, for she gave back more than she had got, replying, ' Good-bye \u2014 if you are going to say no more.' Then in struck Mr. Julian : ' What can I say ? You arc nothing to me. . . I could forgive a woman doing anything for spite, except marrying for spite.' ' The connection of that with our present meeting does not appear, unless it refers to what you have done. It does not refer to me.'"], [29, "TIIE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 15 ' I am not married ; you are.' She did not contradict him, as she might have done. ' Christopher,' she said at last, ' this is hoAV it is : you knew too much of me to respect me, and too little to pity me. A half knoAvledge of another's life mostly does injustice to the life half known,' ' Then since circumstances forbid my knowing you more, I must do my best to knoAv you less, and ele vate my opinion of your nature by forgetting what it consists in.' he said, in a voice from Avhich all feeling was polished aAvay. ' If I did not knoAv that bitterness had more to do with those words than judgment, I \u2014 should be \u2014 bitter too ! You. neA-er knew half about me ; you only kneAv me as a governess ; you little think Avhat my beginnings Avere.' ' I have guessed. I have many times told myself that your early life was superior to your position when I first met you. I think I may say Avithout presump tion that I recognise a lady by birth Avhen I see her, even under reverses of an extreme kind. And cer tainly there is this to be said, that the fact of having been bred in a wealthy home does slightly redeem an attempt to attain to such a one again.' Ethelberta smiled a smile of many meanings. ' However, we are wasting words,' he resumed, cheerfully. ' It is better for us to part as Ave met, and continue to be the strangers that Ave have become to each"], [30, "16 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. other. I OAve you an apology for having been betrayed into more feeling than I had a right to show, and let us part friends. Good night, Mrs. Pethenvin, and suc cess to you. We may meet again some day, I hope.' ' Good night,' she said, extending her hand. He touched it, turned about, and in a short time nothing remained of him but quick regular brushings against the heather in the deep broad shadow of the moor. Ethelberta sloAvly moved on in the direction that he had pointed out. This meeting had surprised her in several ways. First, there was the conjuncture itself ; but more than that was the fact that he had not parted from her Avith any of the tragic resentment that she had from time to time imagined for that scene if it ever occurred. Yet there Avas really nothing Avonderful in this : it is part of the generous nature of a bachelor to be not indisposed, after years of sepa ration, to forgive a portionless SAveetheart Avho, by marrying elseAvhere, has deprived him of the bliss of being obliged to marry her himself. Ethelberta would have been disappointed quite had there not been a comforting development of exasperation in the middle part of his talk ; but after all it formed a poor substi tute for the loving hatred she had expected. When she reached the hotel the lamp over the door shoAved a face a little flushed, but the agitation Avhich at first had possessed her Avas gone to a mere nothing. In the hall she met a slender Avoman wearino1 o"], [31, "17 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. a silk dress of that peculiar black Avhich in sunlight proclaims itself to have once seen better days as a broAvn, and days even better than those as a lavender, green, or blue. 'Menlove,' said the lady, 'did you notice if any gentleman observed ancl followed me when I left the hotel to go for a Avalk this evening ? ' The lady's-maid, thus suddenly pulled up in a night forage after lovers, put a hand to her forehead to shoAv that there Avas no mistake about her having begun to meditate on receiving orders to that effect, and said at last, ' You once told me, ma'am, if you recollect, that Avhen you were dressed, I was not to go staring out of the window after you as if you were a doll I had just manufactured and sent round for sale.' ' Yes, so I did.' ' So I didn't see if anybody folloAved you this evening.' ' Then did you hear any gentleman arrive here by the late train last night ? ' ' 0 no, ma'am \u2014 Iioav could I ?

Going at once upstairs, Ethelberta ran down the passage, ancl after some hesitation softly opened the door of the sitting-room in the best suite of apartments that the inn could boast of. In this room sat an elderly lady writing by the light of two candles Avith green shades. Well knowing, as it seemed, who the intruder Avas, she continued her occupation, and her visitor advanced and stood beside the table. The old lady Avore her spectacles low down her cheek, her glance being depressed to about the slope of her straight white nose in order to look through them. Her mouth Avas pursed up to almost a youthful shape as she formed the letters with her pen, and a slight move of the lip accompanied every downstroke. There were tAvo large antique rings on her forefinger, against which the quill rubbed in moving backwards and forwards, thereby causing a secondary noise rival ling the primary one of the nib upon the paper.

After signing her name to the letter, she raised her eyes. 'Why, how late you are, Ethelberta, and Iioav heated you look ! ' she said. ' I have been quite alarmed about you. What do you say has happened ? ' The great, chief, and altogether eclipsing thing that had happened Avas the accidental meeting Avith an old lover Avhom she had once quarrelled Avith ; and Ethel berta's honesty would have delivered the tidings at once, had not, unfortunately, all the rest of her attri butes been dead against that act, for the old lady's sake even more than for her OAvn. ' I saw a great cruel bird chasing a harmless duck ! ' she exclaimed, innocently. ' And I ran after to see what the end of it Avould be \u2014 much further than I had any idea of going. HoAvever, the duck came to a pond, and in running round it to see the end of the fight, I could not remember Avhich Avay I had come.' ' Mercy !

' ' Do you mean the Julians ? ' ' Yes, that was the name.' ' Why, of course you know it was the Juhans.

' Oh yes, I recollect,' said Ethelberta. 'And he had a sister, I think. I Avonder Avhere they went to live after the family collapse.' ' I do not know,' said Lady Pethenvin, taking up another sheet of paper. ' I have a dim notion that the son, Avho had been brought up to no profession, became a teacher of music in some country tOAvn \u2014 music having ahvays been his hobby.

Here she thoughtfully sat down awhile, and some time later she rang for her maid. ' Menlove,' she said, Avithout looking toAvards a rustle and half a footstep that had just come in at the door, but leaning back in her chair and speaking toAvards the corner of the looking-glass, ' will you go dow-n ancl find out if any gentleman named Julian has been staying in this house ?

' Thank you, that will do,' replied her mistress. The hour greAv later, and that dreamy period came round when ladies' fancies, that have lain shut up close as their fans during the day, begin to assert themselves anew. At this time a good guess at Ethelberta's thoughts might have been made from her manner of passing the minutes aAvay. Instead of reading, entering notes in her diary, or doing any ordinary thing, she Avalked to and fro, curled her pretty nether lip -within her pretty upper one a great many times, made a cradle of her locked fingers, and paused with fixed eyes where the Avails of the room set limits upon her walk to look at nothing but a picture within her mind."], [37, "23 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. CHAPTEE H. CHRISTOPHER'S HOUSE \u2014 SANDBOURNE TOWN SANDBOURNE MOOR. During the Avet autumn of the same year, the postman passed one morning as usual into a plain street that ran through the landAvard portion of Sandbourne, a coast town and watering-place not many miles from Angle bury. He knocked at the door of a flat-faced Avhite house, having two Avindows on each floor, so that the front altogether Avas like a large six-of-spades. The door Avas opened by a slight, thoughtful young man, Avith his hat on, just then coming out, and there Avas put into his hands a book packet, addressed, ' Christo pher Julian, Esq.' Christopher took the package upstairs, opened it Avith curiosity, and discovered within a green volume of poems, by an anonymous writer, the title-page bearing the inscription, 'Metres by Me.' The book was neAv, though it was cut, and it appeared to have been looked into. The young man, after turning it over and exclaiming, 'Who the deuce sent this, I"], [38, "24 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. wonder ? ' laid it on the table and Avent his way, being in haste to fulfil his engagements for the day. In the evening, on returning home from his occu pations, he sat himself doAvn cosily to read the newly arrived volume. The Avinds of this uncertain season Avere snarling in the chimneys, and drops of rain spat themselves into the fire, reA-ealing plainly that the young man's room Avas not far enough from the top of the house to admit of a twist in the flue, and revealing darkly a httle more, if that social rule-of-three inverse, the higher in lodgings the loAver in pocket, were appli cable here. HoAvever, the aspect of the room, though homely, was cheerful, a somewhat contradictory group of furniture suggesting that the collection consisted of waifs and strays from a former home, large and long established, the grimy faces of the old articles exer cising a curious and subduing effect on the bright faces of the new. An oval mirror of rococo Avorkmanship, and a heavy cabinet-piano with a cornice like that of an Egyptian temple, adjoined a harmonium of yesterday, and a harp that was almost as iicav. Printed music of the last century, and manuscript music of the pre\\Tious evening, lay there in such quantity as to endanger the tidiness of a retreat Avhich was indeed only saved from a chronic state of litter by a pair of hands that some times played, with the lightness of breezes, about the seAving-machine standing in a remote corner \u2014 if any corner could be called remote in a room so small."], [39, "THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 25 Fire lights and shades from the shaking flames struck in a butterfly flutter on the underparts of the mantel-shelf, and upon the reader's cheek as he sat. Presently, and all at once, a much greater intentness pervaded his face : he turned back again, and read aneAv the subject that had arrested his eyes. He Avas a man whose countenance varied Avith his mood, though it kept somewhat in the rear of that mood. He looked sad when he felt almost serene, and only serene Avhen he felt quite cheerful. It is a habit people acquire avIio have had repressing experiences. A faint smile and flush noAv lightened his face, and jumping up he opened the door and exclaimed, 'Faith ! will you come here for a moment ? ' A prompt step Avas heard on the stairs, and the young person addressed as Faith entered the room. She was small in figure, and bore less in the form of her features than in their shades Avhen changing from expression to expression the evidence that she was his sister. ' Faith \u2014 I want your opinion. But, stop, read this first.' He laid his finger upon a page in the book, and placed it in her hand. The girl drew from her pocket a httle green leather sheath, Avorn at the edges to Avhitey-brown, and out of that a pair of spectacles, unconsciously looking round the room for a moment as she did so, as if to ensure that no stranger saw her in the act of using them."], [40, "26 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. Here a Aveakness Avas uncovered at once ; it Avas a small, pretty, and natural one ; indeed, as weaknesses go in the great Avorld, it might almost have been called a commendable trait. She then began to read, Avithout sitting doAvn. These ' Metres by Me' composed a collection of soft and marvellously musical rhymes, of a nature knoAvn as the vers de societe. The fines presented a series of playful defences of the supposed strategy of woman kind in fascination, courtship, and marriage \u2014 the whole teeming Avith ideas bright as mirrors and just as unsub stantial, yet forming a brilliant argument to justify the Avays of girls to men. The pervading characteristic of the mass Avas the means of forcing into notice, by strangeness of contrast, the single mournful poem that the book contained. It was placed at the very end, and under the title of 'Cancelled Words,' formed a whimsical and rather affecting love-lament, somewhat in the tone of many of Sir Thomas Wyatt's poems. This Avas the piece whicli had arrested Christopher's attention, and had been pointed out by him to his sister Faith. ' It is very touching,' she said, looking up. ' What do you think I suspect about it \u2014 that the poem is addressed to me ! Do you remember, Avhen father was alive and Ave were at Scarborough that season, about a governess avIio came there \"with a Sir"], [41, "THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 27 Ealph Petherwin and his Avife, people with a sickly little daughter and a groAvn-up son ? ' ' I never saAV any of them. I think I remember your knoAving something about a young man of that name.' ' Yes, that Avas the family. Well, the governess there Avas a very attractive woman, and somehow or other I got more interested in her than I ought to haA-e done (this is necessary to the history), and Ave used to meet in romantic places \u2014 and \u2014 and that kind of thing, you knoAv.

Well, I decided to think no more of her, and I Avas helped to do it by the troubles that came upon us shortly aster- Avards ; it is a blessed arrangement that one does not feel a sentimental grief at all AAdien additional grief comes in the shape of practical misfortune. HoAvever, on the first afternoon of the little holiday I took for my Avalking tour last summer, I came to Anglebury and stayed about the neighbourhood for a clay or two to see what it was like, thinking we might settle there if this place failed us. The next evening I left, and walked across the heath to Stonford \u2014 that's a village about five miles further on \u2014 so as to be that distance on my Avay for next morning ; and Avhile I Avas crossing the heath there I met this very Avoman. We talked a little,,"], [42, "28 THE nAND OF ETHELBERTA. because we couldn't help it \u2014 you may imagine the kind of talk it was \u2014 and parted as coolly as we had met. Now this strange book comes to me ; and I have a strong conviction that she is the -writer of it, for that poem sketches a similar scene \u2014 or rather suggests it ; and the tone generally seems the kind of thing she would Avrite \u2014 not that she was a sad woman, either.' ' She seems to be a warm-hearted, impulsive woman, to judge from these tender verses.' ' People who print very warm words have some times very cold manners.

' If I were her husband I should have doubts about the dying. And \" all over \" may not be so plain to other people as it is to you.' ' Perhaps not. And when a man checks all a Avoman's finer sentiment towards him by marrying her,"], [43, "THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 29 it is only natural that it should find a vent someAvhere. However, she probably does not know of my doAvnfall since father's death. I hardly think she Avould have cared to do it had she known that. (I am assuming that it is Ethelberta \u2014 Mrs. Pethenvin \u2014 avIio sends it : of course I am not sure.) We must remember that Avhen I kneAv her I was a gentleman at ease, av!io had not the least notion that I should have to Avork for a living, and not only so, but should have first to invent a profession to Avork at out of my old tastes.' ' Kit, you have made two mistakes in your thoughts of that lady. Even though I don't know her, I can show you that. Noav I'll tell you : the first is in think ing that a married lady Avould send the book Avith that poem in it Avithout at any rate a shght doubt as to its propriety : the second is in supposing that, had she wished to do it, she Avould have given the thing up because of our misfortunes. With a true Avoman the second reason woidd have had no effect had she once got over the first. I'm a Avoman, ancl that's Avhy I know.' Christopher said nothing, and turned over the poems. He lived by teaching music, and, in comparison AA-ith starving, thrived ; though the wealthy might pos sibly have said that in comparison Avith thriving he starved. During this night he hummed airs in bed, thought he would do for the ballad of the fair poetess"], [44, "30 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. Avhat other musicians had done for the ballads of other fair poetesses, and dreamed that she smiled on him as her prototype Sappho smiled on Phaon. The next morning before starting on his rounds a new circumstance induced him to direct his steps to the bookseller's, and ask a question. He had found on examining the wrapper of the volume that it was posted in his own town. ' No copy of the book has been sold by me,' the bookseller's voice replied from far up the Alpine height of the shop-ladder, where he stood dusting stale volumes, as Avas his habit of a morning before customers came. ' I have never heard of it \u2014 probably never shall ; ' and he shook out the duster, so as to hit the delicate mean between stifling Christopher and not stifling him. ' Surely you don't live by your shop ? ' said Chris topher, draAving back. The bookseller's eyes rested on the speaker's ; his face changed ; he came doAvn and placed his hand on the lappel of Christopher's coat. ' Sir,' he said, 'country bookselling is a miserable, impoverishing, exasperating thing in these days. Can you understand the rest? ' ' I can ; I forgive a starving man anything,' said Christopher. 'You go a long Avay very suddenly,' said the book seller. ' Half as much pity would have seemed better. HoAvever, wait a moment.' He looked into a list of"], [45, "31 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. neAv books, and added : ' The work you allude to Avas only published last week ; though, mind you, if it had been published last century I might not have sold a copy.' Although his time Avas precious, Christopher had now become so interested in the circumstance that the unseen sender Avas somebody breathing his oavu atmo sphere, possibly the very writer herself \u2014 the book being too new to be knoAvn \u2014 that he again passed through the blue shadoAv of the spire Avhich stretched across the street to-day, and went toAArards the post-office, animated by a bright intention \u2014 to ask the postmaster if he knew the hancUvriting in which the packet Avas addressed. Noav the postmaster was an acquaintance of Chris topher's, but, as regarded putting that question to him, there was a difficulty. Everything turned upon Avhether the postmaster at the moment of asking Avould be in his under-government manner, or in the manner Avith which mere nature had endowed him. In the latter case his reply Avould be all that could be wished ; in the former, a man who had sunk in society might as well put his tongue into a mousetrap as make an enquiry so obviously outside the pale of legality as was this. So he postponed his business for the present, and refrained from entering till he passed by after dinner, when pleasant malt liquor, of that capacity for cheering"], [46, "32 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. which is expressed by four large letter X's marching in a roAv, had refilled the globular trunk of the postmaster and neutralised some of the effects of officialty. The time was Avell chosen, but the enquiry threatened to prove fruitless : the postmaster had never, to his know ledge, seen the writing before. Christopher was turning aAvay when a clerk in the background looked up and stated that some young lady had brought a packet Avith such an address upon it into the office two days earlier to get it stamped. ' Do you know her ? ' said Christopher. The clerk had not been there long, and he ansAvered the question : ' I have seen her about the neighbour hood. She goes by every morning ; I think she comes into the tOAvn from beyond the common, and returns ao-ain betAveen four and five in the afternoon.' _> ' What does she wear ? ' ' A Avhite wool jacket Avith zigzags of black braid.' Christopher left the post-office and went his way. He hardly seemed inclined to push his enquiries Avith much vigour till after a discussion in the evening Avith Faith, in which she entirely agreed with him in thinking that neither author nor sender, whether different per sons or one and the same, was likely to be Ethelberta. This, by a feeling of opposition, led him to resolve that he would at any rate just cast eyes upon the stranger. Among his other pupils there Avere tAvo aa-Iio lived at some distance from Sandbourne \u2014 one of them in the"], [47, "33 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. direction indicated as that habitually taken by the young person ; and in the afternoon, as he returned home- Avard, Christopher loitered and looked around. At first he could see nobody ; but Avhen about a mile from the outskirts of the town he discerned a light spot ahead of him, which actually turned out to be the jacket alluded to. In due time he met the Avearer face to face ; she Avas not Ethelberta Pethenvin \u2014 quite a dif ferent sort of individual. He had long made up his mind that this Avould be the case, yet he Avas in some indescribable Avay disappointed. Of the two classes into which gentle young Avomen naturally divide, those avIio grow red at their Aveddings, and those Avho groAV pale, the present one belonged to the former class. She Avas an April-natured, pink cheeked girl, with eyes that would have made any jeweller in England think of his trade \u2014 one who evidently took her day in the daytime, frequently caught the early Avorm, and had little to do Avith yawns or candlelight. She came and passed him ; he fancied that her countenance changed. But one may fancy anything, and the pair receded each from each Avithout turning their heads. He could not speak to her, plain ancl simple as she seemed.

Hence the beauties, concords, and eloquences of the female form Avere never with- out then effect upon Christopher, a born musician, artist, poet, seer, mouthpiece \u2014 whichever a transla- tor of Nature's oracles into simple speech may be called. The young girl avIio had gone by was fresh and pleasant ; moreoA-er, she Avas a sort of mysterious link betAveen himself and the past, Avhich these things Avere vividly reviving in him. He had for some time intended to fix his lessons out of town at a somewhat later hour than hitherto, and he now found that this alteration might lead to a meeting with her every lesson-day, Avhen perhaps, if he Avished, an opportunity might occur of making her acquaintance. The con- templated change of time Avas carried out the following Aveek, and at once Christopher met her again. She had not much dignity, he had not much reserve, and the sudden resolution to have a holiday which some- times impels a plump heart to rise up against a brain that overweights it Avas not to be resisted. He just lifted his hat, and put the only question he could think of as a beginning : ' Have I the pleasure of addressing the author of a book of very melodious poems that was sent me the other day ? ' The girl's forefinger tAvirled rapidly the loop of braid that it had previously been tAvirling slowly, and draAving in her breath she said, 'No, sir.'"], [49, "THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 35 'The sender, then?' 'Yes.' She somehoAv presented herself as so insignificant by the combined effect of the manner and the words that Christopher lowered his method of address to her level at once. 'Ah,' he said, 'such an atmosphere as the writer of \" Metres by Me \" seems to breathe would soon spoil cheeks that are fresh ancl round as lady apples \u2014 eh, little girl ? But are you disposed to tell me that Avriter's name ? ' By applying a general idea to a particular case a person with the best of intentions may find himself im mediately landed in a quandary. In saying to the coun try girl before him Avhat would have suited the mass of country lasses Avell enough, Christopher had offended her beyond the cure of compliment. The expression about lady-apples and little girl Avas not the kind of thing she cared for. ' I am not disposed to tell the Avriter's name,' she replied, with a dudgeon that Avas very great for one Avhose Avhole stock of it was a trifle. And she passed on and left him standing alone. Thus further conversation Avas checked ; but per haps that very flaAv in his proceedings for approaching her Avas Avhat led Christopher to adhere to the re arranged hours of his lesson ; he met her the next Wednesday, and the next Friday, and throughout the folloAving week \u2014 no further Avords passing between D 2"], [50, "36 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. them. For a Avhile she went by A-ery demurely, appa rently mindful of his offence. But effrontery is not proved to be part of a man's nature till he has been guilty of a second act : the best of men may commit a first through accident or ignorance \u2014 may even be be trayed into it by over-zeal for experiment. Some such conclusion may or may not have been arrived at by the girl with the lady-apple cheeks ; at any rate, after the lapse of another Aveek a new spectacle presented itself; her redness deepened wheneA-er Christopher passed her by, and embarrassment pervaded her from the loAvest stitch to the tip of her feather. She had little chance of escaping him by diverging from the road, for a figure could be seen across the open ground to the distance of half a mile on either side. One day as he drew near as usual, she met him as Avomen meet a cloud of dust \u2014 she turned and looked backwards till he had passed. This Avould have been disconcerting but for one reason : Christopher Avas ceasing to notice her. He was a man Avho often, when Avalking abroad, and look ing as it Avere at the scene before his eyes, discerned successes and failures, friends and relations, episodes of childhood, Avedding feasts and funerals, the landscape suffering greatly by these visions, until it became no more than the patterned Avail-tints about the paintings in a gallery ; something necessary to the tone and mode, yet not regarded. Nothing but a special con-"], [51, "37 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. \u25a0centration of himself on externals could interrupt this habit, and iioav that her appearance along the Avay had changed from a chance to a custom he began to lapse again into the old trick. He gazed , once or tAvice at her form Avithout seeing it : she met him the next afternoon with a parasol over her face, completely screening it from observation. He did not notice that the parasol trembled. The Avomanly device of the parasol had prevailed but a feAV days, Avhen a boy who tended the cows browsing in scores about the meadows asked Chris topher the time of day, and afterwards stood regard ing him Avith an arrangement of face in which the eyes dwindled very narroAv, and gave up their place as the most noticeable features of the countenance to the upper and loAver toavs of teeth. ' Well, what makes you merry ? ' said Christopher. ' Hee-hee-hee, Sir ! \u2014 that young woman you meets with the little umbrella ! ' ' What about her ? ' Christopher sharply asked. ' Why, Sir, she've got a little small hole in her umbrella, and Avhen you think she don't see ye a morsel, she's eyeing ye all the time through the little small hole ! ' Christopher went on thinking hoAV oddly he had got mixed up with this insignificant Avoman. Discretion required more than ever that he should act as if there were no such being within his horizon. And as he"], [52, "38 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. could not conveniently alter the time of his return home, he made it a point to read, with painful intent ness, from some book every day in his Avalk, for it taxed his dignity of gaze a little to meet a w-oman who was reduced to the condition of timorously watching him like a mouse in a hole \u2014 childish as the trick was. Thus book in hand he regularly approached her noAv, and could discern whenever he chose, over the margin of the page which he Avas supposed to be concentrated upon, the hem of her garment, or the tip of her toe slipping past ; but he never looked up from his book while the moor contained her. This Avent on till six weeks had passed from the time of their first encounter. Latterly might have been once or tAvice heard, AAdien he had moved out of earshot, a sound like a small gasping sigh ; but no arrangements Avere disturbed, and Christopher continued to keep down his eyes as persistently as a saint in a church window. The last day of his engagement had arrived, and with it the last of his Avalks that way. On his final return he carried in his hand a bunch of floAvers which had been presented to him at the country-house Avhere his lessons were given. He Avas taking them home to his sister Faith, avIio prized the lingering blossoms of the seeding season. Soon appeared as usual his felloAv traveller; Avhereupon Christopher looked doAvn upon his nosegay. ' SAveet simple girl,' he thought, ' I'll"], [53, "39 TIIE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. endeavour to make peace with her by means of these floAA-ers before Ave part for good.' When she came up he held them out to her and said, 'Will you allow me to present you Avith these ? ' The bright colours of the nosegay instantly attracted the girl's hand \u2014 perhaps before there had been time for thought to thoroughly construe the position ; for it happened that when her arm was stretched into the air she steadied it quickly, ancl stood with the pose of a statue \u2014 rigid Avith uncertainty. But it Avas too late to refuse : Christopher had put the nosegay within her fingers. Whatever pleasant expression of thanks may have appeared in her eyes fell only on the bunch of floAvers, for during the whole transaction they reached to no higher level than that. To say that he Avas coming no more seemed scarcely necessary under the circum stances, and -wishing her ' Good afternoon' very heartily he passed on. He had learnt by this time her occupation, Avhich was that of pupil-teacher at one of the schools in the town, whither she Avalked daily from a village near. If he had not been poor and the little teacher humble, Christopher might possibly have been tempted to en quire more briskly about her, and who knows how such a pursuit might have ended ?

It Avas one of those hostile days of the year when chatterbox ladies remain miserably in their homes to save the carriage and harness, Avhen clerks' wives hate living in lodgings, AA'hen vehicles and people appear in the street with duplicates of themselves underfoot, Avhen bricklayers, slaters, and other out-door journeymen sit in a shed and drink beer, Avhen ducks and drakes play with hilarious delight at their oavii famdy game, or spread out one Aving aster another in the slower enjoyment of letting the delicious moisture penetrate to their innermost cIoavii. The smoke from the flues of Sandbourne had barely strength enough to emerge into the drizzling rain, hanging doAvn the sides of each chimney-pot like the streamer of a be calmed ship ; and a troop of mice might have rattled down the pipes from roof to basement Avith less noise than did the water that day. On the broad moor to landward of the toAvn, where Christopher's meetings with the teacher had so regularly occurred, Avere a stream and some large"], [56, "42 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. pools ; and beside one of these, near some hatches and a Aveir, stood a little square building, not much larger inside than the Lord Mayor's coach. It was knoAvn simply as ' The Weir House.' On this Avet afternoon, which was the one folloAving the day of Christopher's last lesson over the plain, a nearly invi sible smoke came from the puny chimney of the hut. Though the door AA-as closed, sounds of chatting and mirth fizzed from the interior, and Avould have told anybody Avho had come near \u2014 which nobody did \u2014 that the usually empty shell was tenanted to-day. The scene within Avas a large fire in a fireplace to Avhich the Avhole floor of the house Avas no more than a hearthstone. The occupants Avere two gentlemanly persons, in shooting costume, who had been traversing the moor for miles in search of Avild duck and teal, a Avaterman, and a small spaniel. In the corner stood their guns, and t\\vo or three Avild mallards, which represented the scanty product of their morning's labour, the iridescent necks of the dead birds replying to every flicker of the fire. The tAvo sportsmen Avere smoking, and their man AA-as mostly occupying himself in poking and stirring the fire with a stick : all three appeared to be pretty Avell Avetted. One of the gentlemen, by Avay of varying the not. very exhilarating study of four brick walls Avithin mi croscopic distance of his eye, turned to the small square hole which admitted light and air to the hut, and"], [57, "43 TIIE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. looked out upon the dreary prospect before him. The Avide concave of cloud, of the monotonous hue of dull pewter, formed an unbroken hood over the level from horizon to horizon ; beneath it, reflecting its Avan lustre, the glazed high-road which bisected the moor stretched, hedgeless and ditchless, past a directing-post where another road joined it, and on to the less regular ground beyond, lying hke a riband unrolled across the scene, till it vanished over the furthermost undulation. Beside the pools Avere occasional tall sheaves of flags and sedge, and about the plain a feAV bushes, these forming only obstructions near at hand to a view othenvise unbroken. The sportsman's attention was attracted by a figure in a state of gradual enlargement as it approached along the road. ' I shoidd think that if pleasure can't tempt a native out of doors to-day, business AA-ill never force him out,' he observed. ' There is, for the first time, somebody coming along the road.' 'If business don't drag him out pleasnre'U never tempt en, is more like our nater in these parts, sir,' said the man, who was looking into the sire.

Instead of coming further she sloAvly retraced her steps for about a hundred yards, and partially hid herself among some stunted thorns. ' That's an appointment,' said the first speaker, as he removed, the cigar from his lips ; ' and by the lords, what a day and place for an appointment Avith a Avornan ! ' ' What's an appointment ?

Where nothing particular is going on, one incident makes a drama ; and, interested in that proportion, the art-sportsman puts up his eyeglass (a form he ad hered to before firing at game that had risen, by which merciful arrangement the bird got safe off), placed his face beside his companion's, and also peered through the opening.

' Query, Iioav long wUl she Avait for him (for it is a him to a certainty) ?

The smoking Avent on, and up she came into open ground as before, ancl walked lingeringly by. ' I wonder who the girl is, to come to such a place as that in this Aveather?

TAventy minutes passed, and the girl returned miserably to the hand-post, still to wander back to her retreat behind the sedge, and lead any chance comer from the opposite quarter to believe that she had not yet reached this ultimate point beyond which a meet ing with Christopher Avas impossible. ' Noav you'll find that she means to Avait the com plete half-hour, and then off she goes Avith a broken heart.' All three iioav looked through the hole to test the truth of the prognostication.

As they had guessed, the pupil- teacher, hearing the distant toAvn-clock strike the hour, ga\\-e way to her fancy no longer, and launched into the diverging path. This lingering for Christopher's arrival had, as is known, been founded on nothing more of the nature of an assignation than lay in his regular Avalk along the plain at that time every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of the six previous Aveeks. It must be said that he was very far indeed from divining that his inju dicious peace-offering of the floAvers had stirred into hfe such a wearing, anxious, hopeful, despairing solici tude as this, which had been latent for some time dming his constant meetings with the little stranger.

Before him extended the lamp lit Avatering-place itself, the specks of flame Avith Avhich it Avas tricked out enlarging in long perspective from points far right and left to a throng in the centre of the picture, like tA\\'o opposing rockets with their sparks transfixed.

' Oh, Christopher, I knew you were here,' she said eagerly. ' You are wanted ; there's a servant come from WyndAvay House for you. He is sent to ask if you can come immediately to play at a little dance they have resolved upon this evening \u2014 quite suddenly it seems. If you can come, you must bring with you any assistant you can lay your hands upon at a moment's notice, he says.' ' WyndAvay House ; why on earth should the people send for me above all other musicians in the town ? ' Faith did not knoAv. ' If you really decide to go,' she said, as they walked homeAvard, ' you might take me as your assistant. I should answer the purpose, shoidd I not, Kit ? since it is only a dance or two they seem to want.' ' And your harp I suppose you mean. Yes ; you might be competent to take a part. It cannot be a regular ball ; they Avould have had the quadrille band for anything of that sort. Faith \u2014 we'll go. However, let us see the man first, and enquire particulars.' Reaching home, Christopher found at his door a horse and waggonette in charge of a man-servant in livery, who repeated what Faith had told her brother.

Christopher quickly prepared himself and put a neAv string or two into Faith's harp, by which time she also A\\Tas dressed ; and, wrapping up herself and her in strument safe from the night air, aAvay they drove at half-past nine. ' Is it a large party ? ' said Christopher, as they Avhizzed along. ' No, sir ; it is what Ave call a dance \u2014 that is, 'tis like a ball, you knoAv, on a small scale \u2014 a ball on a spurt, that you never thought of till you had it.

'Well, yes\u2014 it is rather dull for 'em \u2014 Christmas time and all. As soon as it was proposed they were Avild for sending post-haste for somebody or other to play to them.'

Such gates as crossed the roads had been left open by the forethought of the coachman, and, passing the lodge, they proceeded about half a mile along a private driA-e, then as cended a rise, and came in view of the front of the mansion, punctured with windows that Avere now mostly lighted up. 'What is that?' said Faith, catching a glimpse of something that the carriage-lamp showed on the face of one Avail as they passed, a marble bas-relief of some battle-piece, built into the stonework. ' That's the scene of the death of one of the squire's forefathers \u2014 Colonel Sir Martin Jones, who Avas killed at the moment of victory in the battle of Salamanca \u2014 but I haven't been here long enough to know the rights of it. When I am in one of my meditations, as I wait here Avith the carriage sometimes, I think how many more get killed at the moment of victory than at the moment of defeat \u2014 'tis one of the contradictions of nature.

They alighted and Avent in, Christopher shoulderino- Faith's harp, and she marching modestly behind, Avith curly-eared music-books under her arm.

The door next to this was then opened for them, and they en tered. Scarcely had Faith, or Christopher either, ever be held a more shining scene than was presented by the saloon in which they iioav found themselves. Coming direct from the gloomy park, and led to the roomby that back passage from the servants' quarter, the light from the chandelier and branches against the Avails, striking on gilding at all points, quite dazzled their sight for a minute or two ; it caused Faith to move forAvard Avith her eyes on the floor, and filled Christopher with an impulse to turn back again into some dusky corner where every thread of his not over-new dress suit \u2014 rather moth-eaten through lack of feasts for airing it at \u2014 could not be counted so easily. He was soon seated before a grand piano, and Faith sat down under the shadow of her harp, both being arranged on a dais Avithin an alcove at one end of the room. A screen of ivy and holly had been constructed across the front of this recess for the games of the children on Christinas Eve, and it still remained there, a small creep-hole being left for entrance and exit.

On the other hand, the musicians, having a much Aveaker light, could hardly be discerned by the performers in the dance. The music was now rattling on, and the ladies in their foam-like dresses were busily threading and spin ning about the floor, wdien Faith, casually looking up into her brother's face, Avas surprised to see that a change had come over it. At the end of the quadrille he leant across to her before she had time to speak, and said quietly, ' She's here ! ' ' Who ? ' said Faith, for she had not heard the Avords of the coachman. ' Ethelberta.' ' Then it Avas she avIio wrote the book ? ' ' It seems that it must have been.' ' Which is she ? ' asked Faith, peeping through with the keenest interest.

She Avas a plump-armed creature, with a white round neck as firm as a fort \u2014 altogether a vigorous shape, as refreshing to the eye as the green leaves through whicli he beheld her.

The production of dance-music Avhen the criticising stage among the dancers has passed, and they have groAvn full of excitement and animal spirits, does not require much concentration of thought in the producers thereof; and desultory conversation accordingly Avent on betAveen Faith and her brother from time to time. ' Kit,' she said on one occasion, ' are you looking at the Avay in which the flowers are fastened to the leaves ? \u2014 taking a mean advantage of being at the back of the tapestry ? You cannot think how you stare at them.' ' I Avas looking through them \u2014 certainly not at them.

Kit, I have never yet seen her look once this way.' Christopher had certainly not yet received look or gesture from her; but his time came. It Avas while he Avas for a moment outside the recess, and he caught her in the act. She became slightly confused, turned aside, and entered into conversation with a neighbour. It was only a look, and yet what a look it Avas! One may say of a look that it is capable of division into as many species, families, tribes, orders, and classes as the animal Avorld itself; that it rules schools and parlia ments ; is the recognised medium of matrimonial lan guage in public, of pre-matrimonial language in private, of honeymoon language in public and private both \u2014 and is but a little thing after all.

With tingling fingers and aching arms they came out of the alcove into the long and deserted apartment, iioav pen-aded by a dry haze. The sights had burnt Ioav, and Faith and her brother Avere waiting by request till the Avaggonette Avas ready to take them home, a breakfast being in course of preparation for them meanAvhile.

The brilliant disc fired all the Avaves that lay betAveen it and the shore at the bottom of the grounds, Avhere the water tossed the ruddy hght from one undu lation to another in glares as large and clear as mirrors, incessantly altering them, destroying them, and creating them again ; while further off they multiplied, thick ened, and ran into one another like struggling armies till they met the fiery source of them all. ' Oh, Iioav wonderful it is ! ' said Faith, putting her hand on Christopher's arm. ' Who kneAv that Avhilst Ave were all shut in here with our puny illumination such an exhibition as this Avas going on outside ! How sorry ancl mean the grand and stately room looks iioav !

The leaves and flowers which had ap peared so very green and blooming by the artificial light were now seen to be faded ancl dusty. Only the gilding of the room in some degree brought itself into keeping Avith the splendours outside, stray darts of light seizing upon it and lengthening themselves out along fillet, quirk, arris, and moulding, till Avasted away. ' It seems,' said Faith, ' as if all the people avIio"], [75, "THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 61 Avere lately so merry here had died : Ave ourselves look no more than ghosts.' She turned up her Aveary face to her brother's, which the incoming rays smote aslant, making little furroAvs of every pore thereon, and shady ravines of every little furrow. ' You are very tired, Faith,' he said. ' Such a heavy night's Avork has been almost too much for you.' ' Oh, I don't mind that,' said Faith. 'But I could not have played so long by myself ' We filled up one another's gaps ; and there were plenty of them toAvards the morning ; but, luckdy, people don't notice those things Avhen the small hours draw on.' ' What troubles me most,' said Faith, ' is not that I have worked, but that you should be so situated as to need such miserable assistance as mine. We are poor, are we not, Kit ? ' ' Yes, we know a little about poverty,' he replied in as cheerful a tone as could be given to the opinion by one avIio had been made to simmer so painfully over the fires of that affliction as had he. While thus lingering \u2014 In shadoAvy thoroughfares of thought, Faith interrupted with, ' I believe there is one of the dancers noAv ! why, I should have thought they had all o-one to bed and Avouldn't get up again for days.' She indicated to him a figure on the lawn towards the"], [76, "62 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. lest, looking upon the same flashing scene as that they themselves beheld. 'It is your oavii particular one,' continued Faith. ' Yes, I see the blue flowers under the edge of her cloak.' ' And I see her squirrel-coloured hair,' said Chris- topher. Both stood looking at this apparition, who once, and only once, thought fit to turn her head towards the front of the house they were gazing from. Faith was one in whom the meditative somewhat overpowered the active faculties ; she went on, Avith no abundance of love, to theorise upon this gratuitously charming woman, Avho, striking freakishly into her brother's path, seemed hkely to do him no good in her sisterly estimation. Ethelberta's bright and shapely form stood before her critic now, smartened by the motes of sun light from head to heel : Avhat Faith would have given to see her so clearly Avithin ! 'Without doubt she is already a lady of many experiences,' she said dubiously. ' And on the way to many more,' said Christopher ; ' perhaps forming altogether a romance curiously budt up, and fitted out Avith circumstance, crisis, and catas trophe, in the regular way \u2014 many men's names possibly Avritten even now as doomed to be again Avrou^ht in with it.' The tone was just of the kind which may be"], [77, "63 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. imagined of a sombre man who had been up all uight piping that others might dance. Faith parted her lips as if in consternation at pos sibilities. Ethelberta, having already become an influ ence in Christopher's system, might soon become more \u2014 an indestructible fascination \u2014 to drag him about, turn his soul inside out, harrow him, twist him, and other wise torment him, according to the stereotyped form of such processes. ' Never ! ' exclaimed the youngest of old maids, quivering. ' What does that mean ? ' ' I hardly know what ; what are poetically called shadows, lights, fancies \u2014 in fact, notliing, dear Kit.' They were interrupted by the opening of a door. A servant entered ancl came up to them. ' This is for you, I beheve, sir,' he said. ' Two guineas ; ' and he placed the money in Christopher's hand. ' Some breakfast will be ready for you in a moment if you like to have it. Would you wish it brought in here ; or will you come to the steward's room ? ' ' Yes, we wdll come.' Ancl the man then began to extinguish the lights one by one. Christopher dropped the two pounds and two shillings singly into his pocket, ancl looking listlessly at the footman said, ' Can you tell me the address of that lady on the lawn ?

' The lady I mean is quite a girlish sort of woman.' 'Yes, yes, so she is \u2014 that's the one.

However, it wiU soon be dull enough ; she and Lady Petherwin are off to-mor row for Rookington, where I believe they are going to stay over New Year's day.' ' Where do you say they are going ?

Faith overheard him. ' That makes no difference to us, does it ? ' she said wistfully. Forty minutes later they were driving along an open road over a ridge which commanded a view of a small inlet below them, the sands of this nook being sheltered by white cliffs. Here at once they saw, in the full hght of the sun, two women standing side by side, theU faces directed over the sea. ' There she is again ! ' said Faith.

She handed to Picotee a small parcel. ' This is for yourself,' she went on, giving a small packet besides. ' It wiU pay your fare home and back, and leave you something to spare.' ' Thank you,' said Picotee, docilely. ' Now, Picotee,' continued the elder, ' let us talk for a few minutes before I go back : we may not meet again for some time.' She put her arm round the waist of Picotee, who did the same by Ethelberta ; and thus interlaced they walked backwards and forwards upon the firm flat sand with the motion of one body animated by one wiU.

A few weeks later there was a friendly dinner-party at the house of a gentleman called Doncastle, who hved in a moderately fashionable square of west London. All the friends and relatives present were nice people, who exhibited becoming signs of pleasure and gaiety at being there ; but as regards the vigour with which these emotions were expressed, it may be stated that a slight laugh from far down the throat and a slight narrowing of the eye were equivalent as indices of the degree of mirth felt to a Ha-ha-ha ! ancl a shaking of the shoulders among the minor traders of the kingdom ; and to a Ho-ho-ho ! contorted features, purple face, and a stamping foot among the gentlemen in corduroy and fustian who adorn the remoter provinces. The conversation was chiefly about a volume of musical, tender, and humorous rhapsodies lately issued to the world in the guise of verse, which had been reviewed and talked about everywhere. This topic, beginning as a private dialogue between a young"], [93, "THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 77 painter named Ladywell and the lady on his right hand, had enlarged its ground by degrees, as a subject will extend on those rare occasions when it happens to be one about which each person has thought something beforehand, instead of, as in the natural order of things, one to which the oblivious listener replies me chanically, with earnest features, but with thoughts fir away. And so the whole table made the matter a thing to enquire or reply upon at once, ancl isolated rills of other chat died out like a river in the sands. ' Witty things, and occasionally Anacreontic : and they have the originality which such a style must naturally possess when carried out by a feminine hand,' .said Ladywell. ' If it is a feminine hand,' said a man near. Ladywell looked as if he sometimes knew secrets, though he did not wish to boast, and made no answer. 'Written, I presume you mean, in the Anacreontic measure of three feet and a half \u2014 spondees and iambics?' said a gentleman in spectacles, glancing round, and giving emphasis to his enquiry by causing bland glares of a circular shape to proceed from his glasses towards the person interrogated. The company appeared willing to give consider ation to the words of a man who knew such things as that, and hung forward to listen. But Ladywell stopped the whole current of affairs in that direction by saying\u2014"], [94, "78 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. ' 0 no ; I was speaking rather of the matter and tone. In fact, the \"Seven Days' Review\" said they were Anacreontic, you know ; and so they are \u2014 anyone may feel they are.' The general look then implied a false encourage ment, and the man in spectacles looked down again, being a nervous person, who never had time to show his merits because he was so much occupied in hiding his faults. 'Do you know the authoress, Mr. Neigh?' con tinued Ladywell. ' Can't say that I do,' he replied. Neigh was a man who never disturbed the flesh upon his face except when he was obliged to clo so, and paused semicolons where other people only paused commas ; as he moved his chin in speaking, motes of light from under the candle-shade caught, lost, and caught again the outlying threads of his burnished beard. ' She will be famous some day ; and you ought at any rate to read her book.' ' Yes, I ought, I know. In fact, some years ago I should have clone it immediately, because I had a reason for pushing on that way just then.' 'All, what was that?

Jolland, and Snooks, and Brown, and Chummins, ancl several more I knew were all that way inclined, and gave up paying their bills, ancl threw away then brushes and combs, and did no end of prehminary things of that sort ; and then I didn't care about it, somehow.' ' How is Jolland getting on ? ' ' I have not heard since he shut himself up and left off mankind.' ' I don't understand high art, and am utterly in the dark on what are the true laws of criticism,' a plain married lady, who wore arch\u00e6ological jewellery, was saying at this time. ' But I know that I have derived an unusual amount of amusement from those verses, and I am heartily thankful to \" Me \" for them.' ' I am afraid,' said a gentleman who was suffering from a bad shh-t-front, ' that an estimate which depends upon feeling in that way is not to be trusted as per manent opinion.' The subject now flitted to the other end.

'I, for my part, hke something merry,' said an elderly woman, whose face was bisected by the edge of a shadow, which toned her forehead and eyelids to a livid neutral tint, and left her cheeks and mouth hke metal at a white heat in the uninterrupted light. ' I tliink the liveliness of those baUads as great a recom mendation as any. After all, enough misery is known to us by our experiences and those of our friends, and what we see in the newspapers, for all purposes of chastening, without having gratuitous grief inflicted upon us.' ' But you would not have wished that \" Romeo and Juliet\" should have ended happily, or that Othello should have discovered the perfidy of his Ancient in time to prevent all fatal consequences ? ' ' I am not afraid to go so far as that,' said the old lady. ' Shakespeare is not everybody, and I am sure that thousands of people who have seen those plays would have driven home more cheerfully afterwards if by some contrivance the characters could all have been joined together respectively. I uphold our anonymous author on the general ground of her levity.' ' Well, it is an old and worn argument \u2014 that about the inexpedience of tragedy \u2014 and much may be said on both sides. It is not to be denied that the anony mous Sappho's verses \u2014 for it seems that she is really a Avoman \u2014 are clever.' ' Clever !

' That's a sign of her actual coldness ; she lets off her feehng in theoretic grooves, and there is sure to be none left for practical ones. Whatever seems to be the most prominent vice, or the most prominent virtue, in anybody's writing is the one thing you are safest from in personal dealings with the writer.' ' Oh, I don't mean to call her warmth of feeling a vice or virtue exactly ' ' I agree with you,' said Neigh to the last speaker but one, in tones as emphatic as they possibly could be Avithout losing their proper character of indifference to the whole matter. ' Warm sentiment of any sort, whenever we have it, disturbs us too much to leave us repose enough for writing it down.' ' I am sure, when I was at the ardent age,' said the mistress of the house, in a tone of pleasantly agreeing with everyone, particularly those who were diametricaUy opposed to each other, ' I could no more have printed such emotions and made them public than I \u2014 could have helped privately feehng them.' ' I wonder if she has gone through half she says ? If so, what an experience ! ' ' 0 no \u2014 not at all likely,' said Mr. Neigh.

' I don't think that she has written a word more than what every woman would deny feeling in a society where no woman says what she means or does what she says. And can any praise be greater than that?' ' Hadia ! Capital ! ' ' All her verses seem to me,' said a rather stupid person, ' to be simply \u2014 Tral'-la-la-lal'-la-la-la', Tral'-la-la-lal'-la-la-lu', Tral'-la-la-lal'-la-la-lalla, Tral'-la-k-lu' When you take away the music there is nothing left. Yet she is plainly a woman of great culture.' ' Have you seen what the \"LondonLight\" says about them \u2014 one of the finest things I have ever read in the way of admiration ?

' Good, is it not ? ' added Ladywell. They assented, but in such an unqualified manner that half as much readiness would have meant more.

' Ah, Mr. Ladywell,' said another, ' now we have found you out. You know her ! ' ' Now \u2014 I say \u2014 ha-ha !

' I heard a man say that the novelty with which the"], [101, "85 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. ideas are presented is more noticeable than the origi nality of the ideas themselves,' observed Neigh. ' The woman has made a great talk about herself; ancl I am quite weary of people asking of her condition, place of abode, has she a father, has she a mother, or clearer one yet than all other.'

He was a man of whom, if the shape of certain bones and muscles of the face is ever to be taken as a guide to the character, one might safely have predicated conscientiousness in the performance of duties, a thorough knowledge of all that appertained to them, a general desire to live on without troubling his mind about anything which did not concern him. Any person interested in the matter would have assumed without hesitation that the estimate his employer had given of Chickerel was a true one \u2014 more, that not only would the butler under aU ordinary circum stances resolutely prevent his face from showing curiosity in an unbecoming Avay, but that, Avith the soul of a true gentleman, he Avould, if necessary, equivocate as readily as the noblest of his betters to remove any stain upon his honour in such trifles.

CHAPTER VHI. CHRISTOPHER'S LODGINGS \u2014 THE GROUNDS ABOUT ROOKINGTON. Meanwhile, in the distant tOAvn of Sandbourne, Chris topher Julian had recovered from the weariness pro duced by his labours at the Wyndway evening-party where Ethelberta had been a star. Instead of engaging his energies to clear encumbrances from the tangled way of his life, he now set about reading the popular ' Metres by Me ' Avith more interest ancl assiduity than ever ; for though Julian Avas a thinker by instinct, he was only a Avorker by effort ; and the greater of these kinds being dependent upou the less for its exhibi tion, there Avas often a lamentable lack of evidence of his power in either. It is a provoking correlation, aud has conduced to the obscurity of many a genius. ' Kit,' said his sister, on reviving at the end of the bad headache Avhich had followed the dance, ' those poems seem to have increased in value Avith you. The lady, lofty as she appears to be, would be flattered if she only could know how much you study them. Have vou decided to thank her for them ? Now let"], [111, "THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA 95 us talk it over \u2014 I like having a chat about such a pretty neAv subject.' ' I would thank her in a moment if I were abso lutely certain that she had anything to clo with sending them, or even Avriting them. I am not quite sure of that yet.' ' How strange that a Avoman could bring herseU to Avrite those verses ! ' ' Not at aU strange \u2014 they are natural outpourings.' Faith looked criticaUy at the remoter caverns of the fire. ' Why strange ? ' continued Christopher. ' There is no harm in them.' ' 0 no \u2014 no harm. But I cannot explain to you \u2014 unless you see it partly of your OAvn accord \u2014 that to \"write them she must be rather a fast lady \u2014 not a bad fast lady ; a nice fast lady, I mean, of course. There, I have said it now, and I daresay you are vexed with me, for your interest in her has deepened to what it originaUy was, I think. I don't mean any absolute harm by \"fast,\" Kit.' ' Bold, forward, you mean, I suppose ? ' Faith tried to hit upon a better definition which should please all round ; and, on failing to do so, looked concerned at her brother's somewhat grieved appearance, and said, helplessly, 'Yes, I suppose Ido.' ' My idea of her is quite the reverse.

You will, for certain, not be interested in something I Avas going to teU you, Avhich I thought Avould have pleased you immensely ; but it is not worth mentioning now7.' ' If you AviU not tell me, never mind. But don't be crabbed, Kit ! You know how interested I am in all your affairs.' ' It is only that I have composed an air to one of the prettiest of her songs, \" When tapers tall \" \u2014 but I am not sure about the power of it. This is how it begins \u2014 I threw it off in a few minutes, after you had gone to bed.' He Avent to the piano and lightly touched over an air, the manuscript copy of whicli he placed in front of him, and listened to hear her opinion, having proved its value frequently ; for it was not that of a woman merely, but impersonally human. Though she was unknown to ftime, this was a great gift in Faith, since to have an unsexed judgment is as precious as to be an unsexed being is deplorable. 'It is very fair indeed,' said the sister, scarcely moving her lips in her great attention. ' Noav again, ancl again, and again. How could you do it in the time ! ' Kit knew that she admired his performance : pas-"], [113, "97 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. sive assent was her usual praise, and she seldom insisted vigorously upon any view of his compositions unless for purposes of emendation. ' I Avas thinking that, as I cannot very AveU write to her, I may as wTell send her this,' said Christopher, with lightened spirits, voice to correspond, and eyes likewise ; ' there can be no objection to it, for such things are done continually. Consider while I am gone, Faith. I shall be out this evening for an hour or two.' When Christopher left the house shortly after, in stead of going into the town on some errand, as was customary Avhenever he went from home after dark, he ascended a back street, passed over the hills behind, and walked at a brisk pace inland along the road to Rookington Park, where, as he had learnt, Ethelberta and Lady Pethenvin were staying for a time, the day or two Avhich they spent at Wyndway having formed a short break in the middle of this visit. The moon Avas shining to-night, ancl Christopher sped onwards over the pallid high road as readily as he could have done at noouday. In three-quarters of an hour he reached the park gates ; and entering now upon a tract Avhich he had never before explored, he w7ent along more cautiously ancl Avith some uncertainty as to the precise direction that the road Avould take. A frosted expanse of even grass, on Avhich the shadow of his head appeared Avith an opal halo round it, soon allowed the house to be VOL. I. H"], [114, "98 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. discovered beyond, the other portions of the park abounding with timber older and finer than that of any other spot in the neighbourhood. Christopher with drew into the shade, and wheeled round to the front of the building that contained his old love. Here he gazed ancl idled, as many a man has done before him \u2014 wondering which room the fan poetess occupied, waiting till lights began to appear in the upper Avindows \u2014 Avhich they did as uncertainly as glow-worms blink ing up at eventide \u2014 and warming Avith currents of revived feeling in perhaps the sweetest of all conditions. New love is brightest, and long love is greatest ; but revived love is the tenderest thing knoAvn upon earth. Occupied thus, Christopher was greatly surprised to see, ou casually glancing to one side, another man standing close to the shadoAvy trunk of another tree, in a similar attitude to his oavu, gazing, with arms folded, as blankly at the windows of the house as Christopher himself had been gazing. Though nothing in his own action had appeared at all black or vdlanous to him, this duplicate of the act in somebody else he instantly felt to be a contemptible thing, demanding instant hatred. Not Aviding to be discovered, Christopher stuck closer to the tree. While he Avaited thus, the stranger began murmuring words, in a slow soft voice. Christopher listened till he heard the following : Pale was the day and rayless, love, Tiiat had an eve so dim."], [115, "THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 99 Two Avell-known lines from one of Ethelberta's poems. Jealousy is a familiar kind of heat which encircles, disfigures, licks playfully, clouds, blackens, eats into, steams, and boils a man as a fire does a pot ; and on recognising these pilferings from what he had grown to regard as his own treasury, Christopher's fingers began to nestle Avith great vigour in the palms of his hands. Three or four minutes passed when the unknown rival gave a last glance at the windows, and Avalked away. Christopher did not like the look of that walk at aU \u2014 there was grace enough in it to suggest that his an tagonist had no mean chance of finding favour in a Avoman's eyes. A sigh, too, seemed to proceed from the stranger's breast ; but as their distance apart Avas too great for any such sound to be heard by any possibility, Christopher set down that to imagination, or to the brushing of the Avind over the trees. The lighted Avindows Avent out one by one, and all the house Avas in darkness. Mr. Julian then walked off himself, with a vigour that was spasmodic only, and with much less brightness of mind than he had experi enced on his journey hither. The stranger had gone another Avay, and Christopher saw no more of him. When he reached Sandbourne, Faith was still sitting up. ' But I told you I was going to take a long Avalk,' he said. n 2"], [116, "100 TIIE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. ' No, Christopher : really you did not. How tired and sad you do look \u2014 though I ahvays know before hand when you are in that state : one of your feet has a drag about it as you pass along the pavement outside the window.' ' Yes, I forgot that I did not tell you.' He could not begin to describe his pilgrimage : it waa too silly a thing even for her to hear of. ' It does not matter at all about my staying up,' said Faith, assuringly ; ' that is, if exercise benefits you. Walking up and down the lane, I suppose ? ' ' No ; not walking up ancl down the lane.' ' The turnpike-road to Rookington is pleasant.' ' Faith, I knoAv you think me a simpleton : that is really where I haA'e been. Hoav came you to know? ' ' I only guessed. Verses ancl an accidental meeting produce a special journey.' ' Ethelberta is a fine Avoman, physicaUy and men tally, both. I wonder people do not talk about her twice as much as they do.' ' Then surely you are getting attached to her again. You think you discover in her more than anybody else does ; and love begins Avith a sense of superior discern ment.' ' I don't feel it.' ' And ends with a sense of blindness.' \u2022 And I don't feel that. What is it hke in the middle ? You may spot me there.'"], [117, "101 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. ' It is not so bad as that, Christopher, is it ? ' she exclaimed, looking up. ' No, no. That is only nonsense,' he said hurriedly. ' HoAvever, love her or love her not, I can keep a corner of my heart for you, Faith. There is another brute after her, too, it seems.' ' Of course there is : I expect there are many. Her position in society is above ours, so that it is an unwise course to go troubling yourself more about her.' ' No. If a needy man must be so foolish as to fall in love, it is best to do so Avhere he cannot double his foolishness by marrying the woman.' ' I don't like to hear you talk so slightingly of what poor father did.' ' Marriage is only an accident of situation, situation an accident of history, history of geography \u2014 and there we go.' Christopher fixed his attention on the supper. That night, late as it Avas, when Faith Avas in bed and sleep ing, he sat before a sheet of music-paper, neatly copying his composition upon it."], [118, "102 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. CHAPTER IX. A VILLAGE INN \u2014 ROOKINGTON DRIVE CHRISTOPHER'S ROOMS. In the general travellers' room of a village inn, not far from Rookington House, a young man sat about noon the next day, partaking of the most delicate luncheon that the house afforded ; the chief delicacy being the whiteness of the table-cloth. This person Avas the painter who had sung the praises of Ethelberta at the dinner in Chevron Square. The term of LadyAvell's visit to Wyndway having expired, he had returned to London, Avith concealed despair on matters connected with eyes, lips, hair, and so on, as observed in Ethel berta, to take his place at Mr. Doncastle's table as Ave have seen ; and at length had sneaked cIoavu here again by the only sort of sneaking that is not mean \u2014 a lover's \u2014 to get a sight of her once more if he could possibly find her. His first disappointment was to discover that she had left Wyndway for Rookington, a house whose inmates he knew nothing of. He Avalked round the premises that very night. Being a painter, he naturally felt himself compelled"], [119, "103 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. to have an artist's eye for everything quaint and queer ; and to-day, as he sat in the inn, Avhdst secretly pre ferring the pictorial effect of London hotels and clubs to anything the country could offer, he conscientiously scrutinised the unceiled AvoodAvork overhead, dyed by the smoke to the hues of deep dark Avines and coffees, and observed with critical clearness the panoramic series of engravings of a fox-hunt, wherein occurred the Avell-knoAvn melancholy portrait of a gentleman, consisting of his boots only, as they appear sticking up from the surface of a stream into Avhich he has fallen head foremost. LadyAveU heard a footstep in the passage, and on looking round saw Christopher enter the room, bearing under his arm a roU of the music he had been at such pains to compose aud copy on the previous days. Julian had an idea that he recognised the face as one Avhich the moonlight had Uluminated the night before in the park hard by, and he was certain that it Avas the face of the man he had seen dancing at the ball with Ethelberta. He composed his countenance as weU as unconscious antagonism would allow him, Avent into the kitchen, and soon had the satisfaction of seeing the enemy pass out. Christopher despatched some rare old ale, which, well foUowed for haU an hour, would have draAvn ' Here's a health to all good lasses,' from the throat of a bishop, and departed in his turn, continuing his"], [120, "104 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. journey towards Rookington House, Avith the view of obtaining audience of Ethelberta. The stroke, con ventionally, was a bold one ; yet, in a simple human light, it Avas the meekest of meek deeds, he reflected ; ' and there must have been a natural impulsive time in human history, before a gimcrack social machinery came into vogue, when every man Acav like an arrow to the feet of every woman avIio attracted him, Avithout a thought of ceremony,' he said aloud. Julian passed the lodge as on the previous evening, aud took a short cut across the open glade, where numbers of rooks dotted the ground hke parsons at a Visitation. The walk Avas pleasant to him, notwith standing that it was one of those perplexing days of winter Avhen the Aveather, by continually hitting on this side ancl on that of the division betAveen wet and fine, is regarded as of Avhichever sort the mood of the observer requires as its background. In the drive before him he saAV a pedestrian carrying a portfolio under his arm ; but Christopher did not recognise the man as LadyweU, Avhoni he had seen taking lunch at the inn, until he had entered the drive himself. The two young men stole an under glance at each other, felt an instinctive objection to such company on such an occasion, and walked along silently at opposite sides of the road, as uniform ancl as parallel in their advance as a pair of Avheels on one axle, and as rigorously separate."], [121, "TIIE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 105 On nearing the house, Julian's heart began to be moved with thrills of pleasure at thoughts of Ethel berta within, but the intruder's presence exercised a constraint over his feelings. Seeing a man-servant at the front entrance, he renounced his original modest intention of going to the side door, ancl advanced Avith his music-roll, Ladywell at the same time doing the same thing. Ladywell then got a httle the better of him, and addressed the porter, Avhose reply Christopher heard. ' Mrs. Petherwin ? She does not live here. A lady of that name was staying here for a feAV days at Christmas, but she has gone home noAv.' At the sound of Avords about her, Christopher could not help blushing a good deal, ancl being a pale man it showed all the more. Looking to see if Lady well observed his Aveakness, he saw that LadyAvell Avas in the middle of precisely the same kind of blush at the same sound. KnoAving by this that LadyweU was as shamefaced as himself about his love, Christopher stood up boldly ancl spoke out. ' Will you oblige me by giving me her address ? ' ' And me, please,' said Mr. LadyAvell. ' I promised her some drawings at WyndAvay the other day, and I wish to send them. It is the same Mrs. Petherwin who was at WyndAvay with Lady Petherwin ? ' ' Yes, sir ; they did go to WyndAvay fbr a day or two, our family as weU. I have heard her address, but"], [122, "106 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. I don't recollect it. Perhaps when Sir James comes home he may be able to tell you.' ' Ah, thanks, but it is not \u2014 I understood that she lived here \u2014 I wiU call again,' stammered Ladywell, withdrawing. Christopher, keeping hi an ancient ex clamation as he heard his questions forestalled word for word by his companion, had also turned away ; and now, pacing doAvn the avenue, much out of heart, he heard LadyAveU's footsteps behind him, fruitlessness resounding from every tread of the painter likeAvise. Quickening his own pace, he put greater distance betAveen them, aud proceeded homeward. ' WeU, after all my trouble to find out about Ethel berta has been in vain, here comes the clue Avithout my asking for it,' said Christopher to Faith, a feAV weeks after the unproductive walk to Rookington Park, described above. She turned and saAV that he Avas reading the ' Wessex Reflector.' ' What is it ? ' asked Faith. ' The secret of the true authorship of the book is out at last, and it is Ethelberta of course. I am so glad to have it proved hers.' ' But can Ave believe ? ' ' 0 yes. Just hear what \" Our London Correspond ent \" says. It is one of the nicest bits of gossip that our tOAvn friend has furnished us Avith for a long time"], [123, "THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 107 \u2014 hoAV he must get about to fiud out such things !

I Avas additionaUy informed by a friend Avhom I met yesterday on his way to the House of Lords, that her name is Mrs. PetherAvin \u2014 Christian name Ethelberta ; and that she resides with her mother in-law at their house in Connaught Crescent. She is, moreover, the daughter of the late Bishop of Silchester (if report may be believed), whose active benevolence, as your readers know, left his famdy in comparatively straitened circumstances at his death. The marriage was a secret one, and much against the wish of her husband's friends, who are wealthy people on all sides. The death of the bridegroom tAvo or three weeks after the wedding led to a reconciliation ; and the young poetess was taken to the home which she still occupies, devoted to the composition of such brilliant effusions as those the world has lately been favoured with from her pen.\" '"], [124, "108 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA.

However, it is all the same noAv, I suppose, Avhether I send it or not. I ahvays knew that our destinies Avould lie apart, though she was once temporarily under a cloud. Her momentary inspiration to Avrite that \" Cancelled Words \" was the Avorst possible omen for me.

Notwithstanding Christopher's affected carelessness, that evening saAV a great deal of nicety bestoAved upon the operation of wrapping up and sending off the song. He dropped it into the box and heard it faU, and with the curious poAver Avhich he possessed of setting his wisdom to watch any particular folly in himself that it could not hinder, speculated as he walked on the re sult of this first tangible step of return to his old position as Ethelberta's lover."], [125, "THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 109 CHAPTER X. A LADY'S DRAWING-ROOMS ETHELBERTA'S DRESSING-ROOM.

' I have quite forgotten \u2014 cannot keep people's names in my head at all; nor could my father either \u2014 nor any of my family \u2014 a very"], [126, "110 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. odd thing. But my old friend Mrs. Napper knows for certain.' And he turned to one of a small group of middle-aged persons near, avIio, instead of skimming the surface of things in general, like the rest of the company, were going into the very depths of them. ' Oh \u2014 that is the celebrated Mrs. Petherwin, the woman aa71io makes rhymes and prints 'em,' said Mrs. Napper, in a detached sentence, and then continued talking again to those on the other side of her. The two loungers Avent on \"with their observations of Ethelberta's headdress, which, though not extraor dinary or eccentric, did certainly convey an idea of indefinable novelty.

' Oh, is that the Avoman at last ? ' said Neigh, dimin ishing his broad general gaze at the room to a Avrinkled criticism of Ethelberta. ' \" The rhymes,\" as Mrs. Napper calls them, are not to be despised,' said his companion. ' The Avriter's opinions of life and society differ very materially from mine, but I cannot help admiring her in the more re flective pieces ; the songs I don't care for. The method"], [127, "111 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. in which she handles curious subjects, and at the same time impresses us Avith a full conviction of her mo desty, is very adroit, and someAvhat blinds us to the fact that no such poems were demanded of her at all.' ' I have not read them,' said Neigh, secretly Avrest ling with his jaw, to prevent a yaAvn ; ' but I suppose I must. The truth is, that I never care much for reading what one ought to read ; I Avish I did, but I cannot help it. And, no doubt, you admire the lady im mensely for writing them : I don't.

I am myself hoping for a corner in some biographical dictionary when the time comes for those works only to contain lists of the exceptional individuals of whom nothing is known but that they lived and died.' ' Ah \u2014 listen. They are going to sing one of her songs,' said his friend, looking towards a bustling move ment in the neighbourhood of the piano. ' I believe that song \" When tapers tall,\" has been set to music by three or four composers already.' ' Men of any note ? ' said Neigh, at last beaten by his yawn, which courtesy nevertheless confined Avithin his person to such an extent that only a feAV unim portant symptoms, such as reduced eyes and a certain rectangular manner of mouth in speaking, were visible. ' Scarcely,' replied the other man.

' Artful clogs \u2014 avIio Avould have thought it ?

But among some others the interest in the songs seemed to be very great ; and it Avas unanimously wished that the young lady Avho had practised the different pieces of music privately would sing some of them now in the order of their composers' reputations. The musical persons in the room unconsciously resolved themselves into a committee of taste. One and another had been tried, Avhen, at the end of the third, a lady spoke to Ethelberta. ' Now, Mrs. Petherwin,' she said, gracefully throw ing back her lace, 'your opinion is by far the most valuable. In which of the cases do you consider the marriage of verse ancl tune to have been most suc cessful ? ' Ethelberta, finding these and other unexpected calls made upon herself, came to the front Avithout flinching. ' The sweetest and the best that I like by far,' she said, ' is none of these.

' 1 think the best plan would be for somebody to write a pamphlet, \" The Shortest Way with the Servants,\" just as there was once AA-ritten a terribly stinging one, \" The Shortest Way with the Dissenters,\" which had a great effect.' ' I have ahvays understood that that was AAiitten by a dissenter as a satire upon the Church ? ' ' Ah \u2014 so it Avas : but the example will clo to illus trate my meaning.' ' Quite so \u2014 I understand \u2014 so it will,' said Mrs. Belmaine, Avith clouded faculties. Meanwhile Christopher's music had arrived.

Then she began, and the SAveetness of her singing Avas such that even the most unsympathetic honoured her by looking as if they would be Avilliug to listen to every note the song con tained if it Avere not quite so much trouble to do so. Some Avere so interested that, instead of continuing then conversation, they remained in sdent consider ation of Iioav they Avould continue it Avhen she had finished ; Avhile the particularly civil people arranged their countenances into every attentive form that the mind could devise. One emotional gentleman looked at the corner of a chair as if, till that moment such an object had never crossed his vision before ; the move ment of his finger to the imagined tune Avas, for the deaf old clergyman, a perfect mine of interest ; Avhilst a young man from the country Avas poAverless to put an end to an enchanted gaze at nothing at all in the exact middle of the room before him. Neigh, and the general phalanx of cool men ancl celebrated club yaAvners, were so much affected that they raised their chronic look of great objection to such things to an expression of scarcely any objection at all. ' What makes it so interesting,' said Mrs. Doncastle"], [134, "118 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. to Ethelberta, when the song was over and she had retired from the focus of the company, ' is, that it is played from the composer's own copy, Avhich has never met the public eye, or any other than his OAvn before to-day. And I see that he has actually sketched in the lines by hand, instead of having ruled paper \u2014 just as the great old composers used to clo. You must have been as pleased to get it fresh from the stocks like that as he probably Avas pleased to get your thanks.' Ethelberta became reflective. She had not thanked Christopher ; moreover, she had decided, after some con sideration, that she ought not to thank him. What neAv thoughts were suggested by that remark of Mrs. Doncastle's, ancl Avhat neAv inclination resulted from the public presentation of his tune and her Avords as parts of one organic whole, are best explained by describing her doings at a later hour, when, having left her friends somewhat early, she had reached home and retired from public view for that evening. Ethelberta Avent to her room, sent aAvay the maid who did double duty for herself and Lady Petherwin, walked in circles about the carpet till the fire had grown haggard and cavernous, sighed, took a sheet of paper ancl wrote : ' Dear Mr. Julian, ' I have said I would not Avrite : I have said it tAvice ; but discretion, under some circumstances."], [135, "119 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. is only another name for unkindness.

She Avas pointing to a paragraph under the heading of ' Literary Notes,' which contained in a few Avords the announcement of Ethelberta's authorship that had more circumstantially appeared in the ' Wessex Reflector.' ' It means what it says,' said Ethelberta, quietly ' Then it is true ? ' ' Yes. I must apologise for having kept it such a secret from you. It Avas not done in the spirit that you may imagine : it was merely to avoid disturbing your mind that I did it so privately.' ' But surely you have not written every one of those ribald verses ?

' Really, one Avould imagine that Avomen wrote their books during those dreams in Avhich people haA7e no moral sense, to see Iioav improper some, even virtuous, ladies become Avdien they get into print.' ' I might have clone a much more unnatural thing than write those poems. And perhaps I might have done a much better thing, and got less praise. But that's the world's fault, not mine.' ' You might have left them unwritten, and shown more fidelity.' ' Fidelity ! it is more a matter of humour than principle. What has fidelity to do AA'ith it ? ' ' Fidelity to my clear boy's memory.' ' It Avould be difficult to sIioav that because I have Avritten so-called tender and gay verse, I feel tender and gay. It is too often assumed that a person's fancy is a person's real mind.

You are too much given to that sort of thing.' ' Well, I don't know Iioav the secret of my name has leaked out ; and I am not ribald, or anything you say,' said Ethelberta, Avith a sigh.

Then she stood and beheld it eaten away Avord after word by the flames.

' Help me to put this out ! ' And the two women Avent trampling Avildly upon the document and smothering it Avith a corner of the hearth-rug. ' What is it ? ' said Ethelberta. ' My will !

' And I was just coming in to tell you that I would ahvays cling to you, and never desert you, ill-use me how you might !

While this was going on in town, Christopher, at his lodgings in Sandbourne, had been throAvn into rare old visions and dreams by the appearance of Ethelberta's letter. Flattered and encouraged to ambition as well as to love by her inspiriting sermon, he put off now the last remnant of cynical doubt upon the genuineness of his old mistress, and once and for all set doAvn as disloyal a belief he had latterly acquired that ' Come, avoo me, woo me ; for I am like enough to consent,' AA7as all a young Avonian had to tell. All the reasoning of political and social economists Avould not have convinced Christopher that he had a better chance in London than in Sandbourne of making a decent income by reasonable and likely labour ; but a belief in a far more improbable proposition, im petuously expressed, Avarmed him Avith the idea that he might become famous there. The greater is fre quently more readily credited than the less, and an argument which will not convince on a matter of half pence appears unansAverable AA-hen apphed to questions"], [147, "131 TIIE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. of glory and honour. The regulation Avet towel and strong coffee of the ambitious and intellectual student floated before him in visions ; but it was Avith a sense of relief that he remembered that music, in spite of its drawbacks as a means of sustenance, was a profession happily unencumbered AA7ith those excruciating pre liminaries to greatness. Christopher talked about the new move to his sister, as may be supposed, and he was vexed that her hopefulness was not roused to quite the pitch of his OAvn. As with others of his sort, his too general habit of accepting the most clouded possibility that chances offered was only transcended by his readiness to kindle Avith a fitful excitement iioav and then. Faith was much more equable. ' If you were not the most melancholy man God ever created,' she said, kindly looking at his vague deep eyes and thin face, Avhich Avas but a feAV degrees too refined and poetical to escape the epithet of lantern-jawed from anyone who had quarrelled with him, ' you would not mind my coolness about this. It is a good thing of course to go ; I have ahvays fancied that we Avere mistaken in coming here.

' Very well,' said Faith, ' I will not depress you by talking my philosophies. If I had to describe you, Kit, I should say you Avere a child in your impulses and an old man in your reflections.' ' What else should an individual be Avhen impulse is Avhat remains in us from childhood, and reflection \\A7hat accumulates with age ? I Avould rather make hay in Avet Aveather than be Avith people avIio are always alike.

' And if I kneAv a woman as I knoAV myself, without her being exactly like myself, I should think her very objectionable.' ' There's the difference. Well, I am going out now7, Faith. Come along Avith me.' When they had walked a little way, Faith entered a shop to make some small purchase, ancl Julian Avent slowly on. Looking doAvn as he loitered, his eyes fell upon a Avhite handkerchief lying on the pavement, and he picked it up. Ahead of him Avas apparently the female who had dropped it. Christopher doubled the length of his strides and came up almost beside her. She Avas his little friend the pupil-teacher, and Chris topher hesitated. Surely she had not dropped her"], [149, "133 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. handkerchief on purpose ? The thought was con fusing, ancl he turned back Avithout her having seen his approach, and joined Faith, avIio Avas noAv coming up. ' Faith,' he said, ' that young lady has dropped her handkerchief ; clo hasten on, and restore it to her. I am going this way.' Faith Avent on as bidden, and Christopher turned aside. He AA7as slightly disconcerted some time after, on turning back from a ramble, to find himself encoun tering the girl again, now Avalking beside Faith, who had entered into conversation with her. Christopher, fancying that neither of them noticed him, thought it best to pass by on the other side quietly, without look ing towards them. It proved, hoAveA'er, that both of them did see him, Avhen Picotee blushed painfully ; Avhereupon Faith opened her eyes. The brother ancl sister did not meet again till the evening. ' Did you restore the handkerchief? ' Chris topher carelessly asked. 'Not to the person you pointed out,' she said. 'I offered it to her, but it was not hers ; she kneAv nothing about it. And then we saw a lady looking for it, and I gave it to her. Who w7as that young person \u2014 do you know? She seemed to know me ancl all about our family ; so, OAving to that and the mistake about the handkerchief, Ave got quite friends.' ' Oh, she is a pupil-teacher at the schools in Common Street.'"], [150, "134 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. ' Only that ? Her dress seems beyond her rank ; she must be one of a good family groAvn poor. Why in our best times I myself never Avore anything richer in material \u2014 or even so rich ; but the cut of her clothes being old-fashioned, its goodness escapes notice almost. And Avhen I asked if she had dropped her handkerchief before saying \" No,\" she looked to see, and I just dis cerned that the one she carried was widely bordered with Avhat had once been really good lace. Well, it being a beautiful day, I walked on out of the town, and so did she, and then we said a little more and a little more to each other, till I found out something in a very odd Avay. We met a man, and I saw from her manner at passing him that she loved him, poor girl ; ancl I fancy the young man, whoever he may be, does not care in the least about her.' Faith looked at him closely. ' That's very unfortunate,' said Christopher, placidly ; and she knew from his manner that he Avas not remark ing that he held the cardinal place in the story himself. ' Yes ; ' Faith continued, ' and when I suspected it, and looked her in the face, she blushed painfully, and tears came into her eyes. And Avhen she saAV that I noticed her confusion, she quite trembled.

SOME LONDON STREETS. Christopher ancl Faith arrived in London on an after noon at the end of winter, and beheld from one of the river bridges snow-white scrolls of steam from the tall chimneys of Lambeth rising against the livid sky behind, as if draAvn in chalk on toned cardboard. The first thing he did that evening, when settled in their apartments near the British Museum, before applying himself to the beginning of the means by whicli success in life was to be attained, was to go out in the direction of Ethelberta's door, leaving Faith \"un packing the things, and sniffing extraordinary smoke smells which she discovered in all nooks and crannies of the rooms. It was some satisfaction to see Ethel berta's house, although the single feature in which it differed from the other houses in the Crescent was that no lamp shone from the fanlight over the entrance \u2014 a speciality which, if he cared for omens, was hardly encouraging. Fearing to linger near lest he might be detected, Christopher stole a glimpse at the door and at the steps, imagined Avhat a trifle of the depression Avorn"], [153, "137 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. in each step her feet had tended to produce, and stroUed home again. Feeling that his reasons for calling just noAv Avere scarcely sufficient, he went next day about the business that had brought him to tOAvn, which referred to a situation as organist in a large chinch in the north-west district. The post Avas half ensured already, and he intended to make of it the nucleus of a professional occupation and income. Then he sat doAvn to think of the preliminary steps toAvards publishing the song that had so pleased her, and had also, as far as he could understand from her letter, hit the popular taste very successfully ; a fact which, hoAvever little it may say for the virtues of the song, as a composition, Avas a great recommendation to it as a property. Christopher was delighted to perceive, as if it were a chance discovery, that out of this position he could frame an admissi ble, if not an unimpeachable, reason for calling upon Ethelberta. He determined to clo so at once, and obtain the required permission by Avord of mouth. He Avas greatly surprised, when the front of the house appeared in view on this spring afternoon, to see what a Avhite and sightless aspect perA7aded all the AvindoAVs. He came close : the eyeball blankness was caused by all the shutters and bhnds being shut tight from top to bottom. Possibly this had been the case for some time \u2014 he could not tell. In one of the"], [154, "138 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. windoAvs was a card bearing the announcement 'This House to be let Furnished.' Here Avas a merciless clash between fancy and fact. Regretting now his faintheartedness in not letting her know beforehand by some means that he Avas about to make a new start in the Avorld, and coming to dAvell near her, Christopher rang the bell to make enquiries. A gloomy sort of caretaker appeared after a while, and the young man asked Avhither the ladies had gone to live. He was beyond measure depressed to learn that they were in the South of France \u2014 Aries, the man thought the place was called \u2014 the time of their return to town being very uncertain ; though one thing AAras clear, they meant to miss the forthcoming London season altogether. As Christopher's hope to see her again had brought a resolve to do so, so uoav resolve led to dogged patience. Instead of attempting anything by letter, he decided to Avait ; and he waited AveU, occupying himself in publishing a 'March' ancl a 'Morning and Evening Service in E flat.' Some four-part songs, too, engaged his attention when the heavier duties of the day were over \u2014 these duties being the giving of lessons in harmony and counterpoint, in which he Avas aided by the introductions of a man AveU known in the musical Avorld, who had been acquainted Avith young Julian as a promising amateur long before he adopted music as the staff of his pilgrimage."], [155, "TIIE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 139 It was the end of summer when he again tried his fortune at the house in Connaught Crescent. Scarcely calculating upon finding her at this stagnant time of the tOAvn year, ancl only hoping for information, Julian Avas surprised and excited to see the shutters open, ancl the house Avearing altogether a hving look, its neighbours having decidedly died off meanwhile. ' The family here,' said a footman in ansAver to his enquiry, ' are only temporary tenants of thc house. It is not Lady Petherwin's people.' ' Do you knoAv the Petherwins' present address ? ' ' Underground, sir, for the old lady. She died some time ago in Switzerland, and was buried there, I believe.' 'And Mrs. PetherAvin \u2014 the young lady?' said Christopher, starting. ' We are not acquainted personally with the family,' the man replied. ' My master has only taken the house for a feAV months, Avhilst extensive alterations are being made in his own on the other side of the park, which he goes to look after every day. If you want any further information about Lady Pethenvin, Mrs. Pethenvin will probably give it. I can let you have her address.' 'Ah, yes ; thank you,' said Christopher. The footman handed him one of some cards which appeared to have been lest for the purpose. Julian, though tremblingly anxious to know Avhere Ethelberta"], [156, "140 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. Avas, did not look at it till he could take a cool survey in private. The address was ' ArroAvthorne Lodge, Wessex.' ' Dear me ! ' said Christopher to himself, ' not far from Melchester; and not dreadfully far from Sand bourne.'"], [157, "141 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. CHAPTER XIY ARROAA'THORNE PARK AND LODGE. Summer Avas just over AA-hen Christopher Julian found himself rattling along in the train on the Avay to Sand bourne on some trifling business appertaining to his late father's affairs, wdiich Avould afford him an excuse for calling at ArroAvthorne about the song of hers that he Avished to produce. He alighted in the after noon at a little station some twenty miles short of Sandbourne, and leaving his portmanteau behind him there, decided to Avalk across the fields, obtain if possible the interview with the lady, and return then to the station to finish the journey to Sandbourne, which he could thus reach at a convenient hour in the evening, and, if he chose, take leave of again the next day. It was an afternoon Avhich had a fungous smell out of doors, all being sunless and stagnant overhead and around. The various species of trees had begun to assume the more distinctive colours of their decline, and where there had been oneJiroad pervasive broAvnish green were noAv tAventy greenish yellows, the air in the"], [158, "THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 142 vistas betAveen them being half opaque with blue ex halation. Christopher in his walk overtook a country man, ancl enquired if the path they were following would take him to Arrowthorne Lodge. ''Twill take 'ee into Arr'thorne Park,' the man replied. ' But you won't come anigh the Lodge, unless you bear round to the left as might be.' ' Mrs. Pethenvin lives there, I believe ? ' ' No, sir. LeastAvise unless she's but lately come. I have never heard of such a woman.' ' She may possibly be only visiting there.' 'Ah, perhaps that's the shape o't. WeU, uoav you tell o't, I have seen a strange face thereabouts once or tAvice lately. A young good-looking maid enough, seemingly.' ' Yes, she's considered a A'ery handsome lady.' ' I've heard the Avoodmen say, iioav that you tell o't, that they meet her every now and then, just at the closing in of the day, as they come home along with their nitches of sticks ; ay, stalking about under the trees by herself \u2014 a tall black martel, so long-legged and awful-like that you'd think 'twas the old feller himself a coming, they say. Noav a Avoman must be a queer body to my thinking, to roam about by night so lonesome and that. Ay, now that you tell o't, there is such a woman, but 'a never have showed in the parish ; sure I never thought who the body was \u2014 no, not once about her, nor Avhere 'a Avas living and that \u2014"], [159, "143 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. not I, till you spoke. Well, there, sir, that's Arr'thorne Lodge ; do you see they three elms ? ' He pointed across the glade toAvards some confused foliage a long way off. ' I am not sure about the sort of tree you mean,' said Christopher, ' I see a number of trees Avith edges shaped like edges of clouds.' ' Ay, ay, they be oaks ; I mean the elms to the left hand.' ' But a man can hardly tell oaks from elms at that distance, my good fellow ! ' ' That 'a can very AveU \u2014 leastwise, if he's got the 9 sense. ' Well I think I see Avhat you mean,' said Chris topher. ' What next ? ' ' When you get there, you bear away smart to nor'Avest, and you'll come straight as a line to the Lodge.' ' How the deuce am I to know Avhich is nortliAvest in a strange place, with no sun to tell me ? ' ' What, not know nor'west ? Well, I should think a boy could never live and groAv up to be a man Avithout knoAving the four quarters. I knoAved 'em when I Avas a mossel of a chiel. We be no great scholars here, that's true , but there isn't a Jack-rag or Tom-straw in these parts that don't know where they lie as Avell as I. Now I've lived, man and boy, these eight-and-sixty years, and never met a man in my life"], [160, "144 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. afore who hadn't learnt such a common thing as the four quarters.' Christopher parted from his companion and soon reached a stile, clambering over AArhich he entered a park. Here he threaded his way, and rounding a clump of aged trees the young man came in view of a light and elegant country-house in the half-timbered Gothic style of the late revival, apparently only a few years old. Surprised at finding himself so near, Christopher's heart fluttered unmanageably till he had taken an abstract vieAv of his position, and, in impa tience at his Avant of nerve, adopted a sombre train of reasoning to convince himself that, far from indulgence in the passion of love bringing bliss, it Avas a folly, leading to grief and disquiet \u2014 certainly one which Avould clo him no good. Cooled down by this, he stepped into the drive and went up to the house. ' Is Mrs. Pethenvin at home ? ' he said, modestly. ' Who did you say, sir ? ' He repeated the name. ' Don't knoAv the person.' ' The lady may be a visitor \u2014 I call on business.' ' She is not visiting in this house, sir.' ' Is not this Arrowthorne Lodge ? ' ' Certainly not.' ' Then where is Arrowthorne Lodge, please ? ' ' Well, it is nearly a mde from here. Under the trees by the high road. If you go across by that"], [161, "145 THE HANI) OF ETHELBERTA. footpath it AviU bring you out quicker than by folloAV ing the bend of the drive.' Christopher Avondered how he could have managed to get into the wrong park ; but, setting it down to his ignorance of the difference betAveen oak ancl elm, he immediately retraced his steps, passing across the park again, through the gate at the end of the drive, and into the turnpike road. No other gate, park, or country seat of any description was within vieAv. ' Can you tell me the Avay to Arrowthorne Lodge ? ' he enquired of the first person he met, who Avas a little girl. ' You are just coining aAvay from it, sir,' said she. ' I'U show you ; I am going that way.' They walked along together. Getting abreast the entrance of the park he had just emerged from, the child said, 'There it is, sir ; I Uve there too.' Christopher, with a dazed countenance, looked to wards a cottage which stood nesthng in the shrubbery and ivy like a mushroom among grass. 'Is that Arrow thorne Lodge ? ' he repeated. 'Yes, and if you go up the drive, you come to Arrowthorne House.' ' ArroAvthorne Lodge \u2014 Avhere Mrs. Pethenvin lives, I mean.' ' Yes. She lives there along wi' mother and we. But she don't want anybody to knoAV it, sir, 'cause she's celebrate, and 'twouldn't do at all.' L A7OL. I."], [162, "146 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. Christopher said no more, and the little girl became interested in the products of the bank ancl ditch by the wayside. He left her, pushed open the heavy gate, ancl tapped at the Lodge door. The latch Avas lifted. ' Does Mrs. Petherwin,' he began, and, determined that there should be no mistake, repeated, ' Does Mrs. Ethelberta Petherwin, the poetess, live here ? ' turning full upon the person who opened the door. ' She does, sir,' said a faltering voice ; ancl he found himself face to face with the pupd-teacher of Sand bourne."], [163, "147 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. CHAPTER XV. THE LODGE, continued \u2014 THE COPSE BEHIND. ' This is indeed a surprise ; I \u2014 am glad to see you ! ' Christopher stammered, with a wire-drawn, radically different smile from the one he had intended \u2014 a smile not without a tinge of ghastliness. ' Yes \u2014 I am home for the holidays,' said the blush ing maiden ; and, after a critical pause, she added, ' If you \"wish to speak to my sister, she is in the plantation Avith the children.' ' 0 no \u2014 no, thank you \u2014 not necessary at all,' said Christopher, in haste. ' I only Avished for an inter vieAv AArith a lady called Mrs. Petherwin.' ' Yes ; Mrs. Pethenvin \u2014 my sister,' said Picotee. ' She is in the plantation. That little path will take you to her in five minutes.' The amazed Christopher persuaded himself that this discovery was very delightful, and Avent on per suading so long that at last he felt it to be so. Unable, like many other people, to enjoy being satirised in words because of the irritation it caused him as aimed at A7ictim, he sometimes had philosophy enough to appreciate a satire of circumstance, because nobody j. 2"], [164, "148 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. intended it. Pursuing the path indicated, he found himself in a thicket of scrubby undergroAvth, which covered an area enclosed from the park proper by a decaying fence. The boughs were so tangled that in folloAving the obstructed track it became necessary to screen his face Avith his hands to escape the risk of having his eyes filliped out by the tAvigs that impeded his progress. Thus slowly adA-ancing, his ear caught, between the rustles, the tones of a voice engaged in earnest declamation; and, pushing round in that direction, he beheld through some beech boughs an open space about ten yards in diameter, floored at the bottom with deep beds of curled old leaves froni fore- gone years, and cushions of furry moss. In the middle of this natural theatre Avas the stump of a tree that had been felled by a saAV, and upon the flat stool thus formed stood Ethelberta, Avhom Christopher had not beheld since the ball at Wynchvay House. Round her, leaning against branches or prostrate on the ground, were five or six individuals. Two AA-ere young mechanics \u2014 one of them evidently a carpenter. Then there Avas a boy about thirteen, and two or three younger children. Ethelberta's appearance answered as fully as ever to that of an English lady skilfully per fected in manner, carriage, look, and accent ; and the incongruity of her present position among lives which had had many of Nature's beauties stamped ont of them, and few of the beauties of Art stamped in, brought"], [165, "Round her. leaning against branches, ob prostrate on the ground, were two or three individuals."], [166, ""], [167, "149 TIIE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. him, as a second feeling, a pride in her that almost equalled his first sentiment of surprise. Christopher's attention Avas meanwhile attracted from the consti tution of the group to the Avords of the speaker in the centre of it \u2014 Avords to Avhich her auditors were listening with still attention. It appeared to Christopher that Ethelberta had lately been undergoing some very extraordinary ex periences. What the beginning of them had been he could not in the least understand, but the portion she was describing came distinctly to his ears, and he Avon dered more and more. ' Nobody came near me for an hour or two,' said Ethelberta, ' I began to think, as one naturally would, that he must have gone from the rock, and left me to pass the night upon it \u2014 perhaps to starve there, for the cliffs of the opposite shore were bare of men, houses, animals, or trees. Where were noAv, I thought, the gallant men avIio Avould have laid down life ancl soul for me but three short hours before ? ' As the evening drew on it came into my mind that I had asked my antagonist what part of the coast we had been landed upon by our mutual enemies. \" The east,\" he had said. I could not contradict him; but it was only necessary to glance towards the setting sun, now pouring its red blaze across the water like \u2022 a newly-opened furnace, to see hoAV completely I had been misinformed."], [168, "150 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. ' However, I was mistaken in supposing myself to be left alone. He Avas as hopelessly imprisoned as I. I had been sitting in the remoter part of the green level space which covered the top of the rock. The sun had gone down some time since, the night had come on, a cold sea fog was blowing upon my face, ancl the mono tonous Avash of the waves beneath Avas lulling my ears. Somebody rose above the line of the slope, and came near me. The gloom Avas by this time too profound for me to see anything distinctly, but I immediately guessed that this Avas he, since he would naturally wait for night, his blindness ceasing to be so great a draw back when the lateness of the hour had brought the same defect upon myself. It evidently had crossed his mind that I might take advantage of his sightless state to give him a sudden push over the cliff, in spite of his great strength, as long as I possessed one extra sense ; in the dark our senses Avere equal. ' I cannot tell why, but at that moment the affliction of my enemy rendered him still more terrible to me. We were both in darkness, for the fog enveloped us like a pall ; but he had the enormous advantage of being used to darkness, whilst to me it Avas strange and hampering. ' He came forward till he, like myself, was about twenty yards from the edge. I instinctively grasped my useless stiletto. Hoav I longed for the assistance"], [169, "151 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. which a little earlier I had so much despised ! Reaching the block or boulder upon which I had been sitting, he clasped his arms around from behind ; his hands closed upon the empty seat, and he jumped up with an oath. This method of attack told me a new thing Avith Avretched distinctness; he had, as I supposed, dis covered my sex ; male attire was to serve my turn no longer. The next instant, indeed, made it clear, for he exclaimed, \" You don't escape me, masquerading madam,\" or some such words, ancl came on. My only hope was that in his excitement he might forget to notice where the grass terminated near the edge of the plateau, though this could be easily felt by a careful walker : to make my own feeling more distinct on this point I hastily bared my feet.' The listeners moistened their lips, Ethelberta tool breath, and then went on to describe the scene that ensued, ' A dreadful variation on the game of Blind man's buff,' being the words by which she charac terised it. Ethelberta's manner had become so impassioned at this point that the lips of her audience parted, the children clung to their elders, and Christopher could control himself no longer. He thrust aside the boughs, and broke in upon the group. ' For Heaven's sake, Ethelberta,' he exclaimed with great excitement, ' where did you meet Avith such a terrible experience as that ? '"], [170, "152 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. The children shrieked, as if they thought that the interruption Avas in some way the catastrophe of the events in course of narration. Everyone started up ; the two young mechanics stared, ancl one of them enquired, in return, 'What's the matter, friend?' Christopher had not yet made reply when Ethel berta stepped from her pedestal down upon the crack ling carpet of deep leaves. ' Mi-. Julian ! ' said she, in a serene voice, turning upon him eyes of such a disputable stage of colour, be tween broAvn and grey, as Avould have commended itself to a gallant duellist of the last century as a point on Avhich it Avas absolutely necessary to take some friend's life or other. But the calmness was artificiaUy clone, and the astonishment that did not appear in Ethelberta's tones Avas expressed by her gaze. Chris topher Avas not in a mood to draAv fine distinctions betAveen recognised and unrecognised organs of speech. He replied to the eyes. ' I oavii that your surprise is natural,' he said, with an anxious look into her face, as if he wished to get beyond this interpolated scene to something more congenial and understood. ' But my concern at such a history of yourself since I last saw you is even more natural than your surprise at my manner of breaking in.' ' That history Avould justify any conduct in one who hears it"], [171, "153 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. ' Yes, indeed.' ' If it were true,' added Ethelberta, smiling. ' But it is as false as ' She could name nothing inhe rently or notoriously false Avithout raising an image of what Avas disagreeable, ancl she continued in a better manner : ' The story I was telling is entirely a fiction, which I am getting up for a particular purpose \u2014 very different from what appears at present.' ' I am sorry there Avas such a misunderstanding,' Christopher stammered, looking upon the ground un certain ancl ashamed. ' Yet I am not, either, for I am very glad you have not undergone such trials, of course. But the fact is I \u2014 being in the neighbourhood \u2014 I ven tured to call on a matter of business, relating to a poem which I had the pleasure of setting to music at the be ginning of the year.' Ethelberta was only a little less ill at ease than Christopher showed himself to be by this way of talking. ' Will you walk sloAvly on ? ' she said gently to the two young meu, ' and take the children with you ; this gentleman wishes to speak to me on business.' The biggest young mau caught up a little one under his arm, and plunged amid the boughs ; another little one lingered behind for a few moments to look shyly at Christopher, with an oblique manner of hiding her mouth against her shoulder and her eyes behind her pinafore. Then she vanished, the boy and the"], [172, "154 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. second young man foUowed, ancl Ethelberta and Chris topher stood within the Avood-bound circle alone. ' I hope I have caused no inconvenience by inter rupting the proceedings,' said Christopher, softly ; ' but I so very much wished to see you \u2014 so very much ! ' ' Did you, indeed \u2014 really wish to see me ? ' she said, gladly. ' Never mind inconvenience then ; it is a word Avhich seems shallow in meaning under the cir cumstances. I surely must say that a visit is to my advantage, must I not ? I am not as I was, you see, and may receive as advantages what I used to consider as troubles.' ' Has your hfe really changed so much ? ' ' It has changed. But what I first meant Avas that an interesting visitor at a wrong time is better than a stupid one at a right time.' ' I had beeu behind the trees for some minutes, looking at you, and thinking of you ; but what you were doing rather interrupted my first meditation. I had thought of a meeting in which Ave shoidd continue our intercourse at the point at which it Avas broken off years ago, as if the omitted part had not existed at all ; but something, I cannot tell what, has upset all that feeling, and ' ' I can soon tell you the meaning of my extraordi nary performance,' Ethelberta broke in quickly, and with a little trepidation. 'My mother-iu-laAv, Lady Petherwin, is dead ; and she has left me nothing but 7 * o"], [173, "155 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. her house ancl furniture in London \u2014 more than I deserve, but less than she had distinctly led me to expect ; and so I am someAvhat in a corner.' ' It is ahvays so.' ' Not ahvays, I think. But this is how it happened. Lady Petherwin was very capricious ; Avhen she was not foolishly kind she Avas unjustly harsh. A great many are like it, never thinking what a good thing it would be, instead of going on tacking from side to side betAveen favour and cruelty, to keep to a mean line of common justice. And so we quarrelled, aud she, being absolute mistress of all her wealth, destroyed her will that was in my favour, and made another, leaving me nothing but the fag-end of the lease of the town-house and the furniture in it, Then, when we were abroad, she turned to me again, forgave everything, and, be coming ill afterwards, Avrote a letter to the brother, to whom she had left the bulk of her property, stating that I was to have 20,000/. of the 100,000/. she had bequeathed to him \u2014 as in the original will \u2014 doing this by letter in case anything should happen to her before a new will could be considered, drawn, and signed, and trusting to his honour quite that he would obey her expressed wish should she die abroad. Well, she did die, in the full persuasion that I Avas provided for ; but her brother (as I secretly expected all the time) refused to be morally bound by a document wdiich had no legal value, and the result is that he has every-"], [174, "156 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. thing, except, of course, the furniture and the lease. It would have been enough to break the heart of a person who had calculated upon getting a fortune, Avhich I never did; for I felt ahv-ays like an intruder and a bondswoman, ancl had wished myself out of the PetherAvin family a hundred times, Avith my crust of bread ancl liberty. For one thing, I was always forbidden to see my relatives, and it pained me much. Now I am going to move for myself, ancl consider that I have a good chance of success in Avhat I may under take, because of an indifference I feel about succeeding which gives the necessary coolness that any great task requires.' ' I presume you mean to write more poems ? ' ' I cannot \u2014 that is, I can write no more that satisfy me. To blossom into rhyme on the sparkling plea sures of life, you must be under the influence of those pleasures, and I am at present quite removed from them \u2014 surrounded by gaunt realities of a very different description.' ' Then try the mournful. Trade upon your suffer ings : many do, ancl thrive.' ' It is no use to say that \u2014 no use at all. I cannot Avrite a line of verse. And yet the others flowed from my heart like a stream ! But nothing is so easy as to seem clever when you have money.' ' Except to seem stupid when you have none,' said Christopher, looking at the dead leaves. Ethelberta alloAved herself to linger on that thought"], [175, "TIIE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 157 for a few seconds ; and continued, ' Then the question arose, what was I to do ? I felt that to write prose would be an uncongenial occupation, and altogether a poor prospect for a woman like me. Finally I bave decided to appear in public' ' Not on the stage ? ' ' Certainly not on the stage. There is no novelty in a poor lady turning actress, and novelty is what I want. Ordinary poAvers exhibited in a new Avay effect as much as extraordinary powers exhibited in an old way.' ' Yes \u2014 so they clo. And extraordinary powers, and a neAv way too, avouIc! be irresistible.' ' I don't calculate upon both. I had Avritten a prose story by request, when it Avas found that I had groAvn utterly inane over verse. It was written in the first person, and the style was modelled after Defoe's. The night before sending it off, AA'hen I had already packed it up, I was reading about the professional storytellers of Eastern countries, Avho devoted their lives to the telling of tales. I unfastened the manu script ancl retained it, convinced that I should do better by telling the story.' ' Well thought of ! ' exclaimed Christopher, looking into her face. ' There is a Avay for everybody to live, if they can only sind it out.' ' It occurred to me,' she continued, blushing slightly, \u00ab that tales of the Aveird kind were made to be told, not"], [176, "158 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. Avritten. The action of a teller is wanted to give due effect to aU stories of incident ; and I hope that a tune will come when, as of old, instead of an unsocial read ing of fiction at home alone, people will meet together cordially, and sit at the feet of a professed romancer. I am going to tell my tales before a London public. As a child, I had a considerable power in arresting the attention of other children by recounting adventures which had never happened ; and men ancl women are but children enlarged a little. Look at this.' She drew from her pocket a folded paper, shook it abroad, and disclosed a rough draft of an announce ment to the effect that Mrs. Petherwin, Professed Story teller, would devote an evening to that ancient form of the romancer's art, at a well-knoAvn fashionable hall in London. ' Now you see,' she continued, ' the meaning of what you observed going on here. That you heard was one of three tales I am preparing, with a view of selecting the best. As a reserved one, I have the tale of my own life \u2014 to be played as a last card. It Avas a private rehearsal before my brothers and sisters \u2014 not Avith any view of obtaining their criticism, but that I might become accustomed to my OAvn voice in the presence of listeners.' ' If I only had had half your enterprise, what I might have done in the Avorld ! ' ' Noav did you ever consider what a power Defoe's manner Avould have if practised by Avord of mouth ?"], [177, "159 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. Indeed, it is a style whicli suits itself infinitely better to telling than to writing, abounding as it does in collo quialisms that are somewhat out of place on paper in these days, but have a Avonderful poAver in making a narrative seem real. And so, in short, I am going to talk Defoe on a subject of my own. Well ? ' The last Avord had been given tenderly, with a long drawn SAveetness, ancl Avas caused by a look that Chris topher AAras bending upon her at the moment, in which he revealed that he was thinking less of the subject she Avas so eagerly ancl hopefully descanting upon than upon her aspect in explaining it. It is a fault of manner particularly common among men neAvly imported into the society of bright and beautiful women ; aud we will hope that, springing as it does from no unworthy source, it is as soon forgiven in the general Avorld as it was here. ' I was only following a thought,' said Christopher : \u2014 ' a thought of how I used to know you, and then lost sight of you, and then discovered you famous, and how we are here under these sad autumn trees, and nobody in sight,' ' I think it must be tea-time,' she said, suddenly. ' Tea is a great meal with us here \u2014 you will join us, will you not?' And Ethelberta began to make for herself a passage through the boughs. Another rustle Avas heard a little Avay off, ancl one of the children appeared."], [178, "160 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. ' Emmeline Avants to know, please, if the gentleman that come to see ye will stay to tea ; because, if so, she's a going to put in another spoonful for him and a bit of best green.' ' Oh, Georgina \u2014 how candid ! Yes, put in some best green.' Before Christopher could say any more to her, they were emerging by the corner of the cottage, ancl one of the brothers dreAv near them. ' Mr. Julian, you'll bide and have a cup of tea Avi' us ? ' he enquired of Christopher ' A old friend of yours, is he not, Mrs. Pethenvin ? ' [Christopher Avondered at the epithet.] ' Dan and I be going back to Sandbourne to-night, and we can walk with ye as far as the station.' ' I shall be delighted,' said Christopher ; and they all entered the cottage. The evening had grown clearer by this time ; the sun Avas peeping out just previous to departure, and sent gold wires of light across the glades and into the AvindoAA-s, throAving a pattern of the diamond quarries, ancl outlines of the geraniums in pots, against the opposite Avail. One end of the room was polygonal, such a shape being dictated by the exterior design ; in this part the windows Avere placed, as at the east end of continental churches. Thus, from the combined effects of the ecclesiastical lancet lights and the apsidal shape of the room, it occurred to Christopher that the sisters Avere all a delightful set of pretty saints, exhibiting themselves in a lady- chapel,"], [179, "161 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. and backed up by unkempt major prophets, as repre sented by the forms of their big brothers. Christopher sat doAvn to tea as invited, squeezing himself in betAveen tAvo children Avhose names were almost as long as their persons, and Avhose tin cups discoursed primitive music by means of spoons rattled inside them until they Avere silled. The tea proceeded pleasantly, notwithstanding that the cake, being a little burnt, tasted on the outside hke the latter plums in snapdragon. Christopher never could meet the eye of Picotee, avIio continued in a wild state of flushing all the time, fixing her looks upon the sugar-basin, except when she glanced out of the windoAv to see how the evening was going on, ancl speaking no Avord at all unless it Avas to correct a small sister of someAvhat crude manners as regards filling the mouth, which Picotee did in a Avhisper, and a gentle inclination of her mouth to the little one's ear, and a still deeper blush than before. Their Adsitor next noticed that an additional cup and-saucer and plate made their appearance occasion ally at the table, were silently replenished, ancl then carried off by one of the children to an inner apart ment. ' Our mother is bedridden,' said Ethelberta, noticing Christopher's look at the proceeding. ' Emmeline at tends to the household, except when Picotee is at home, and Joey attends to the gate ; but our mother's afflic- VOL. i. m"], [180, "162 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. tion is a very unfortunate thing for the poor children. We are thinking of a plan of living Avhich will, I hope, be more convenient than this is ; but we have not yet decided Avhat to do.' At this minute a carriage ancl pair of horses became visible through one of the angular Avindows of the apse, in the act of turning in from the highway towards the park gate. The boy who answered to the name of Joey sprang up from the table with the promptness of a Jack-in-the-box, and ran out at the door. Every body turned as the carriage passed through the gate, Avhich Joey held open, putting his other hand where the brim of his hat would have been if he had worn one, ancl lapsing into a careless boy again the instant that the vehicle had gone by. ' There's a tremendous large dinner-party at the House to-night,' said Emmeline, methodically, looking at the equipage over the edge of her teacup, Avithout leaving off sipping. ' That Avas Lord Mountclere. He's a Avicked old man, they say.' ' Lord Mountclere ? ' said Ethelberta, musingly. ' I used to knoAV some friends of his. In what way is he wicked ? ' ' ' I don't knoAv,' said Emmeline, with simplicity. ' I suppose it is because he breaks the commandments. But I wonder Iioav a big rich lord can want to steal anything.' Emmeline's thoughts of breaking command ments instinctively fell upon the eighth, as being in her"], [181, "THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 163 ideas the only case wherein the game could be consi dered as at all worth the candle. Ethelberta said nothing ; but Christopher thought that a shade of depression passed over her. ' Hook back the gate, Joey,' shouted Emmeline, when the carriage had proceeded up the drive. ' There's more to come.' Joey did as ordered, aud by the time he got in doors another carriage turned in from the pubhc road \u2014 a one-horse brougham this time. ' I knoAv avIio that is : that's Mr. Ladywell,' said Emmeline, in the same matter-of-fact tone. ' He's been here afore : he's a distant relation of the squire's, and he once gave me sixpence for picking up his gloves.' ' What shall I live to see ? ' murmured the poetess, under her breath, nearly dropping her teacup in an in voluntary trepidation, from which she made it a point of dignity to recover in a moment. Christopher's eyes, at the mention of his rival's name, followed by that ex hibition from Ethelberta, entered her own like a pair of lances. Picotee, seeing Christopher's quick look of jealousy, became involved in her turn, and grew pale as a lily in her endeavours to conceal the complica tions to which it gave birth in her poor little breast likewise. ' You judge me very wrongly,' said Ethelberta, in answer to Christopher's hasty look of resentment. ' In supposing Mr. Ladywell to be a great friend of M 2"], [182, "164 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. yours ? ' said Christopher, Avho had in some indescrib able Avay suddenly assumed a right to Ethelberta as his old property. ' Yes : for I hardly know him, ancl certainly do not value him.' After this there was something in the mutual look of the two, though their Avords had been private, which did not tend to remove the anguish of fragile Picotee. Christopher, assured that Ethelberta's embarrassment had been caused by nothing more than the sense of her odd social subsidence, recovered more bliss than he had lost, and regarded calmly the profile of young LadyAvell between the tAvo Avindows of his brougham as it passed the open cottage door, bearing him along unconscious as the dead of the nearness of his beloved one, and of the sad buffoonery that fate, fortune, and the guardian angels had been playing with Ethelberta of late. ' Perhaps you remember seeing him at the Christ mas dance at Wynchvay ? ' she enquired. ' He is a good-natured felloAv. Aftenvards he sent me that portfolio of sketches you see in the corner. He mi<dit possibly do something in the Avorld as a painter if he were obliged to work at the art for his bread, Avhich he is not.' She added, with bitter pleasantry : ' In bare mercy to his self-respect, I must remain unseen here.' It impressed Christopher to perceive how, under"], [183, "165 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. the estrangement which arose from differences of educa tion, surroundings, experience, ancl talent, the sympa thies of close relationship were perceptible in Ethelberta's bearing toAvards her brothers and sisters. At a remark upon some simple pleasure Avherein she had not par ticipated because absent and occupied by far more comprehensive interests, a gloom as of banishment would cross her face ancl dim it for awhile, shoAving that the free habits and enthusiasms of country life had still their charm with her, in the face of the subtler gratifications of abridged bodices, candlelight, and no feelings in particular, which prevailed in tOAvn. Perhaps the one condition Avhich could Avork up into a perma nent feeling the passing revival of his fancy for a woman whose chief attribute he had supposed to be sprightli ness Avas added noAv by the romantic ubiquity of station that attached to her. A discovery Avhich might have grated on the senses of a man wedded to conventionality was a positive pleasure to one whose faith in society had departed Avith his oavii social ruin. The room began to darken, Avhereupon Christopher arose to leave ; and the brothers Sol and Dan offered to accompany him."], [184, "166 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. CHAPTER XVI. A TURNPIKE ROAD. ' We be thinking of coming to London ourselves soon,' said Sol, a carpenter and joiner by trade, as he walked along at Christopher's left hand. ' There's so much more chance for a man up the country. Now, if you Avas me, how should you set about getting a job, Sir?' ' What can you do ? ' said Christopher. ' Well, I am a very good staircase hand ; aud I have been called neat at sash-frames ; ancl I can knock together doors and shutters very AveU ; and I can do a little at the cabinet-making. I don't mind framing a roof, neither, if the rest be busy ; and I am always ready to fill up my time at planing floor-boards by the foot.' ' And I can mix and lay flat tints,' said Dan, Avho was a house-painter, ' and pick out mouldings, and grain in every kind of wood you can mention \u2014 oak, maple, Avalnut, satin-wood, cherry-tree ' ' You can both do too much to stand the least chance of being alloAved to do anything in a city, where limitation is all the rule in labour.

Dan must know Iioav to paint blue to a marvel, but must be quite in the dark about painting green. If you stick to some such principle of specialty as this, you may get employment in London.' ' Ha-ha-ha ! ' said Dan, striking at a stone in the road with the stout green hazel he carried. ' A Avink is as good as a nod : thank'ee \u2014 Ave'll mind all that noAv.' ' If we do come,' said Sol, ' we shall not mix up with Mrs. Petherwin at all.' ' Oh, indeed ! ' ' Oh, no.

'Twould demean her to claim kin aau' her in London \u2014 two journeymen like we, that know nothing besides our trades.'

' Ah, you don't know Berta ! ' said Dan, looking as if he did. ' Hoav \u2014 in what way do you mean ? ' said Christo plier uneasily. ' So lofty \u2014 so very lofty ! Isn't she, Sol ? Why she'll never stir out from mother's till after dark, and then her day begins ; ancl she'll traipse about under the trees, and never go into the high road, so that nobody in the way of gentlepeople shall run up against her and know her living in such a little small hut after biding in a big mansion-place. There, avc don't find fault wd' her about it : Ave hke her just the same, though she don't speak to us in the street ; for a feller must be a fool to make a piece of Avork about a Avoman's pride, when 'tis his own sister, and hang upon her and bother her Avhen he knows 'tis for her good that he should not. Yes, her life has been quare enough. I hope she enjoys it, but for my part I like plain sailing. None of your ups and downs for me. There, I suppose 'twas her nater to Avant to look into the Avorld a bit.' ' Father and mother kept Berta to school, you understand, sir,' explained the more thoughtful Sol, ' because she was such a quick child, and they ahvays had a notion of making a governess of her.

' Why down in these parts, just as you try a man's soul by the Ten Commandments, you try his head by that there sum \u2014 hey, Sol ? ' 'Ay, that Ave do.' ' A herring and half for three-halfpence, how many can ye get for 'levenpence : that's the feller ; and a niortel teaser he is, I assure 'ee. Our parson, who's not altogether Avithout sense o' week days, said one afternoon, \" If cunning can be found in the multiplication table at all, Chickerel, 'tis in connection with that sum.\" Well, Berta was so clever in arithmetic that she was asked to teach summing at Miss Courtley's, and there she got to like foreign tongues more than ciphering, and at last she hated ciphering, and took to books entirely. Mother and we Avere very proud of her at that time : not that we be stuck-up people at aU \u2014 be we, Sol ?

Noav, the men be different. Any man will touch his hat for a pint of beer. But then, of course, there's some difference between the two. Touching your hat is a good deal less to do than bend ing your knees, as Berta used to say, when she was bloAved up for not doing it. She Avas always one of the independent sort \u2014 you never seed such a maid as she was ! Now, Picotee Avas quite the other way.' ' Has Picotee left Sandbourne entirely ?

Christopher laughed, and promised, on condition that they Avould retract the statement about their not being proud ; and then he wished his friends Good night."], [190, "172 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. CHAPTER XVII. AN INNER ROOM AT THE LODGE. At the lodge at this time a discussion of some impor tance was in progress. The scene was Mrs. Chickerel's bedroom, to which, unfortunately, she Avas confined by some spinal complaint ; and here she now appeared as an interesting-faced woman of five-and-forty, properly dressed as far as visible, ancl propped up in a bed covered with a quilt which presented a field of little squares in many tints, looking altogether like a bird's eye view of a market garden. Mrs. Chickerel had been nurse in a nobleman's family until her marriage, and after that she played the part of wife and mother upon the Avhole affec tionately and well. Among her minor differences with her husband had been one about the naming of the children ; a matter that was at last compromised by an agreement under Avhich the choice of the girls' names became her prerogative, and that of the boys' her husband's, who limited his field of selection to strict historical precedent as a set-off to Mrs. Chickerel's tendency to stray iuto the regions of romance."], [191, "173 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. The only grown-up daughters at home, Ethelberta and Picotee, with their brother Joey, Avere sitting near her ; the two youngest children, Georgina and Myrtle, avIio had been strutting in and out of the room, and otherwise endeavouring to walk, talk, and speak hke the gentleman just gone aAA-ay, Avere packed off to bed. Emmeline, of that transitional age Avhich causes its exponent to look Avistfully at the sitters when romping and at the rompers when sitting, uncertain whether her position in the household is that of child or woman, was idling in a corner. The two absent bro thers and two absent sisters \u2014 eldest members of the family \u2014 completed the round ten Avhom Mrs. Chickerel with thoughtless readiness had presented to a crowded world, to cost Ethelberta many Avakeful horns at night while she revolved schemes how they might be decently maintained. ' I still think,' Ethelberta Avas saying, ' that the plan I first proposed is the best. I am convinced that it will not do to attempt to keep on the Lodge. If Ave are all together in tOAvn, I can look after you much better than Avhen you are far aAvay from me down here.' ' Shall avc not interfere Avith you \u2014 your plans for keeping up your connections ? ' enquired her mother, glancing up towards Ethelberta by lifting the flesh of her forehead, instead of troubling to raise her face altogether."], [192, "174 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. ' Not nearly so much as by staying here.' ' But,' said Picotee, ' if you let. lodgings, won't the gentlemen and ladies know it ? ' ' I have thought of that,' said Ethelberta, ' aud this is how I shall manage. In the first place, if mother is there, the lodgings can be let in her name, all bills will be receipted by her, and all tradesmen's orders will be given as from herself. Then, Ave AviU take no English lodgers at all ; Ave will advertise the rooms only in Continental neAvspapers, as suitable for a French or German gentleman or two, ancl by this means there AviU be little danger of my acquaintance dis covering that my house is not entirely a private one, or of any lodger being a friend of my acquaintance. I have thought over every possible way of combining the dignified social position I must maintain to make my story-telling attractive with my absolute lack of money, ancl I can see no better one.' ' Then if GAvendoline is to be your cook, she must soon give notice at her present place ? ' ' Yes. Everything depends upon G\\vendoline and Cornelia. But there is time enough for them to give notice \u2014 Christmas will be soon enough. If they cannot or will not come as cook and housemaid, I am afraid the plan will break doAvn. A vital condition is that I do not have a soul in the house (beyond the lodgers) who is not one of my own relations. When we have"], [193, "175 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. put Joey into buttons, he will do very well to attend to the door.' ' But s'pose,' said Joey, after a glassy look at his future appearance in the position alluded to, ' that any of your gentlepeople come to see ye, and when I opens the door and lets 'em in a swinging big lodger stalks downstairs. What avUI 'em think ? Up will go their eyeglasses at one another till they glares each other into holes. My gracious ! ' ' The one who calls will only think that another visitor is leaving, Joey. But I shall have no visitors, or very feAV. I shall let it be well known among my late friends that my mother is an invalid, and that on this account we receive none but the most intimate friends. These intimate friends not existing, avc receive nobody at all.' ' Except Sol ancl Dan, if they get a job in London ? They'U have to call upon us at the back door, won't they, Berta ? ' said Joey. ' They must go clown the area steps. But they will not mind that ; they like the idea.' ' And father, too, must he go down the steps ? ' ' He may come whichever way he likes. He will be glad enough to have us near at any price. I know that he is not at all happy at leaving you doAvn here, ancl he away in London. You remember that he has only taken the situation at Mr. Doncastle's on the supposition that you all come to towu as soon as he"], [194, "176 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. can see an opening for getting you there ; and as nothing of the sort has offered itself to him, this will be the very thing. Of course, if I succeed wonderfully well in my schemes for story-tellings, readings of my ballads and poems, lectures on the art of versification, and what not, Ave need have no lodgers ; and then we shall all be firing a happy family \u2014 all taking our share in keeping the establishment going.' ' Except poor me ! ' sighed the mother. ' My dear mother, you will be necessary as a steady ing poAver \u2014 a flyAvheel, in short, to the concern. I wish that father could live there, too.' ' He'll never give up his present Avay of hfe \u2014 it has groAvn to be a part of his nature. Poor man, he never feels at home except in somebody else's house, and is nervous and quite a stranger in his oavu. Sich is the fatal effects of service ! ' ' Oh mother, don't ! ' said Ethelberta tenderly, but Avith her teeth on edge ; and Picotee curled up her toes, fearing that her mother was going to moralise. ' Well, what I mean is, that your father Avould not like to live upon your earnings, and so forth. But in town Ave shall be near him \u2014 that's one comfort, cer tainly.' ' And I shall not be wanted at ah,' said Picotee, in a melancholy tone. ' It is much better to stay where you are,' her"], [195, "177 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. mother said. ' You will come and spend the holidays with us, of course, as you do now.' ' I should like to live in London best,' murmured Picotee, her head sinking mournfully to one side. ' I hate being in Sandbourne now ! ' ' Nonsense ! ' said Ethelberta, severely. ' We are all contriving how to live most comfortably, and it is by far the best thing for you to stay at the school. You used to be happy enough there.' Picotee sighed, ancl said no more. VOL. I. N"], [196, "178 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. CHAPTER XVIII. A LARGE PUBLIC HALL. It was the second week in February, Parliament had just met, and Ethelberta appeared for the first time before an audience in London. There AAras some novelty in the species of enter tainment that the active young Avoman had pro posed to herself, and this doubtless had due effect in collecting the body of strangers that greeted her entry, over ancl above those friends Avho came to listen to her as a matter of course. Men and women who had become totally indifferent to new actresses, new readers, and new singers, once more felt the freshness of curiosity as they considered the promise of the an nouncement. But the chief inducement to attend lay in the fact that here was to be seen in the flesh a woman with Avhom the tongue of rumour had been busy in many romantic Avays \u2014 a Avoman who, whatever else might be doubted, had certainly produced a volume of verse Avhich had been the talk of the many who had read them, and of the many more who had not, for several consecutive Aveeks."], [197, "179 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. What Avas her story to be ? Persons interested in the enquiry \u2014 a small proportion, it may be owned, of the Avhole London public, ancl chiefly young men \u2014 answered this question for themselves by assuming that it would take the form of some pungent and gratifying revelation of the innermost events of her own life, from Avhich her gushing lines had sprung as an inevitable consequence, and which being once known, Avould cause such musi cal poesy to appear no longer Avonderful. The front part of the room was well filled, rows of listeners shoAving themselves like a drilled-in crop of which not a seed has failed. They were listeners of the right sort, a majority having noses of the prominent and dignified type, which when vieAved in oblique per spective ranged as regularly as boAv-Avindows at a watering place. Ethelberta's plan was to tell her pretended history and adventures while sitting in a chair \u2014 as if she were at her own fireside, surrounded by a circle of friends. By this touch of domesticity a great appearance of truth and naturalness was given, though really the attitude was at first more difficult to maintain satisfactorily than any one wherein stricter formality should be observed. She gently began her subject, as if scarcely knowing whether a throng were near her or not, and, in her fear of seeming arti ficial, spoke too low. This defect, however, she soon corrected, and ultimately went on in a charmingly colloquial manner. What Ethelberta relied upon soon sr 2"], [198, "180 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. became evident, It Avas not upon the intrinsic merits of her story as a piece of construction, but upon her method of telling it. Whatever defects the tale pos sessed \u2014 ancl they were not a feAV \u2014 it had, as delivered by her, the one pre-eminent merit of seeming like truth. A modern critic has AveU observed of Defoe that he had the most amazing talent on record for telling lies ; and Ethelberta, in AA7ishing her fiction to appear like a real narrative of personal adventure, did Avisely to make Defoe her model. His is a style even better adapted for speaking than for Avriting, ancl the peculi arities of diction Avhich he adopts to give A-erisimilitude to his narratives acquired enormous additional force when exhibited as vivd-voce mannerisms. And although these artifices Avere not, perhaps, slaAdshly copied from that master of delusion, they Avould undoubtedly have reminded her hearers of him, had they not mostly been draAvn from an easeful section in society Avhich is especially characterised by the mental condition of knowing nothing about any author a Aveek after they have read him. The few there avIio did remember Defoe were impressed by a fancy that his Avords greeted them aneAv in a Avinged auricular form, instead of by the weaker channels of print ancl eyesight. The reader may imagine Avhat an effect this well-studied method must have produced when intensified by a clear living voice, animated action, and the brilliant ancl expressive eye of a handsome Avoman \u2014 attributes Avhich of them-"], [199, "181 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. selves almost compelled belief. When she reached the most telling passages, instead of adding exaggerated action aud sound, Ethelberta would lapse to a Avbisper and a sustained stillness, Avhich Avere more striking than gesticulation. All that could be done by art Avas there, and if inspiration was wanting nobody missed it. It was in performing this feat that Ethelberta seemed first to discover in herself the full power of that self-command which further onAvard in her career more and more impressed her as a singular possession, until at last she was tempted to make of it many fantastic uses, leading to results that affected more households than her own. A talent for demureness under diffi culties without the cold-bloodedness Avhich renders such a bearing natural and easy, a face ancl hand reigning unmoved outside a heart by nature turbulent as a wave, is a constitutional arrangement much to be desired by people in general ; yet, had Ethelberta been framed Avith less of that gist in her, her life might have been more comfortable as an experience, ancl brighter as au example, though perhaps duUer as a story. ' Ladywell, how came this Mrs. Petherwin to think of such a queer trick as telling romances, after doing so well as a poet ? ' said a man in the stalls to his friend, who had been gazing at the Story-teller with a rapt face. 'What \u2014 don't you know? \u2014 everybody did, I thought,' said the painter."], [200, "182 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 'A mistake. Indeed, I should not have come here at all had I not heard the subject mentioned by acci dent yesterday at Grey's ; and then I remembered her to be the same Avoman I had met at some place \u2014 Belmaiue's I think it was \u2014 last year, Avhen I thought her just getting on for handsome and clever, not to put it too strongly.' 'Ah ! naturally you Avould not know much,' replied LadyAvell in an eager whisper. ' Perhaps I am judging others by myself a httle more than \u2014 but, as you have heard, she is an acquaintance of mine. I know her very AveU, and, in fact, I originally suggested the scheme to her as a pleasant way of adding to her fame. \" Depend upon it, dear Mrs. PethenAdu,'' I said, during a pause in one of our dances together some time ago, \" any public appearance of yours would be successful beyond description.\" ' ' Oh, I had no idea that you knew her so well ! Then it is quite through you that she has adopted this course ? ' ' Well, not entirely \u2014 I could not say entnely. She said that some clay, perhaps, she might do such a thing ; and, in short, I reduced her vague ideas to form.' ' I should not mind knowing her better \u2014 I must get you to throAV us together in some Avay,' said Neigh, Avith some interest. ' I had no idea that you Avere such an old friend. You could do it, I suppose ? ' ' Really, I am afraid \u2014 hah -hah \u2014 may not have the"], [201, "183 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. opportunity of obliging you.

' said Neigh with a flavour of superciliousness unheeded by his occupied companion."], [202, "184 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. Further back in the room were a pair of faces whose keen interest in the performance contrasted much with the languidly permissive air of t those in front. When the ten-minutes' break occurred, Chris topher was the first of the two to speak. ' Well, what clo you think of her, Faith ? ' he said, shifting restlessly on his seat. ' I like the quiet parts of the tale best, I think,' replied the sister ; ' but, of course, I am not a good judge of these things. Hoav still the people are at times ! I continually take my eyes from her to look at the listeners. Did you notice the fat old lady in the second row, Avith her cloak a little throAvn back? She was absolutely unconscious, and stayed Avith her face up and lips parted like a little child of six.' ' She AveU may : the thing is a triumph.

If I were a woman I would rather go donkey- driving than stick myself up there, for gaping fops to quiz and say Avhat they like about ! But she had no choice, poor thing ; for it was that or nothing with her.' Faith, avIio had secret doubts about the absolute necessity of Ethelberta's appearance in public, said, with remote meanings, ' Perhaps it is not altogether a severe punishment to her to be looked at by well dressed men. Suppose she feels it as a blessing, instead of an affliction ? '"], [203, "185 TIIE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. ' She is a different sort of woman Faith, and so you Avould say if you kneAv her. Of course, it is natural for you to criticise her severely just now, and I don't wish to defend her.' 'I think you do a little, Kit' 'No; I am indifferent about it all. Perhaps it would have been better for me if I had never seen her ; and possibly it might have been better for her if she had never seen me. She has a heart, and the heart is a troublesome encumbrance when great things have to be done. I wish you knew her : I am sure you would like each other.' ' Oh yes,' said Faith, in a voice of rather weak con viction. ' But, as Ave live in such a plain way, it woidd be hardly desirable at present.' Ethelberta being regarded, in common Avith the latest conjuror, spirit-medium, aeronaut, giant, dwarf, or monarch, as a new sensation, she was duly criticised in the morning papers, and even obtained a notice in some of the weekly reviews. ' A handsome woman,' said one of these, ' may have her own reasons for causing the flesh of the London public to creep upon its bones by her undoubtedly remarkable narrative powers ; but Ave question if much good can result from such a form of entertainment. Nevertheless, some praise is due.

' Mrs. Pethenvin's personal appearance is decidedly in her favour,' said another. ' She affects no uncon sciousness of the fact that form and feature are no mean vehicles of persuasion, and she uses the powers of each to the utmost. There spreads upon her face when in repose an air of innocence which is charmingly belied by the subtlety we discover beneath it when she begins her tale ; and this amusing discrepancy between her physical presentment and the inner Avoman is further illustrated by the misgiving, whicli seizes us ou her entrance, that so impressionable a lad}7 will never bear up in the face of so trying an audience. . . .

After such successes as these, Christopher could not forego the seductive intention of calling upon the poetess ancl romancer, at her iioav established town resi dence in Connaught Crescent. One wintry afternoon he reached the door \u2014 now for the third time \u2014 and gave a knock Avhich had in it every tender refinement that could be thrown into the someAvhat antagonistic vehicle of noise. Turning his face down the street he waited restlessly on the step. There Avas a strange light in the atmosphere : the glass of the street-lamps, the varnished back of a passing cab, a milk-woman's cans, and a row of church-windows glared in his eyes like new-rubbed copper ; and on looking the other way he beheld a bloody sun hanging among the chimneys at the upper end, as a danger-lamp to warn him off. By this time the door was opened, and before him stood Ethelberta's young brother Joey, thickly popu lated with little buttons, the remainder of him consist ing of invisible green. ' Ah, Joseph !

Mr. Julian Avas shoAvn to the drawing room, and there he found Ethelberta alone. She gave him a hand so cool and still that Chris topher, much as he desired the contact, Avas literally ashamed to let her see and feel his OAvn, trembling with unmanageable excess of feeling. It Avas ahvays so, always had been so, ahvays Avould be so, at these meet ings of theirs: she Avas immeasurably the strongest; and the deep-eyed young man fancied, in the chagrin Avhich the perception of this difference always bred in him, that she triumphed in her superior control. Yet it was only in little things that their sexes AA7ere thus reversed : Christopher would receive quite a shock if a little dog barked at his heels, ancl be totally unmoved when in danger of his life. Certainly the most self-possessed Avoman in the world, under pressure of the incongruity between their"], [208, "190 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. last meeting and the present one, might have shown more embarrassment than Ethelberta showed ongreeting him to-day. Christopher was only a man in believing that the shyness which she did evince was chiefly the result of personal interest. She might or might not have been said to blush \u2014 perhaps the stealthy change upon her face was too slow an operation to deserve that name : but, though pale Avhen he called, the end of ten minutes saw her colour high and wide. She soon set him at his ease, and seemed to relax a long-sustained tension as she talked to him of her arrangements, hopes, and fears. ' And how do you like London society ? ' said Ethelberta. ' Pretty well, as far as I have seen it : to the surface of its front door.' ' You wiU find nothing to be alarmed at if you get inside.' ' Oh, no \u2014 of course not \u2014 except my oavii short comings,' said the modest musician. ' London society is made up of much more refined people than society anywhere else.' ' That's a very prevalent opinion ; and it is nowhere half so prevalent as in London society itself. HoAvever, come and see my house \u2014 unless you think it a trouble to look over a house ? ' ' No ; I should like it very much.'"], [209, "191 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. The decorations tended toAvards the artistic gym nastics prevalent in some quarters at the present day. Upon a general flat tint of duck's-egg green appeared quaint patterns of conventional foliage, ancl birds, done in bright auburn, several shades nearer to redbreast red than Avas Ethelberta's hair, Avhich Avas thus thrust further toAvards brown by such juxtaposition \u2014 a possi ble reason for the choice of tint. Upon the glazed tiles Avithin the chimney-piece were the forms of owls, bats, snakes, frogs, mice, spiders in their Avebs, moles, and other objects of aversion aud darkness, shaped in black and burnt in after the approved fashion. ' My brothers Sol ancl Dan did most of the actual work,' said Ethelberta, ' though I drew the outlines, and designed the tiles round the fire. The floAvers, mice, and spiders are done very simply, you know : you only press a real floAver, mouse, or spider out flat under a piece of glass, and then copy it, adding a little more emaciation and angularity at pleasure.' ' In that \" at pleasure \" is where all the art lies,' said he. 'Well, yes \u2014 that is the case,' said Ethelberta, thoughtfully ; and, preceding him upstairs, she threw open a door on one of the floors, disclosing Dan in person, engaged upon a similar treatment of this floor also. Sol appeared bulging from the door of a closet, a little further on, Avhere he Avas fixing some shelves ;"], [210, "192 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. and both Avore Avorknien's blouses. At once coming doAvn from the short ladder he was standing upon, Dan shook Christopher's hand with some velocity. ' We do a little at a time, you see,' he said, ' because Colonel doAvn below, and Mrs. Pethenvin's visitors, sha'n't smell the turpentine.' ' We be pushing on to-day to get it out of the Avay,' said Sol, also coming forward ancl greeting their visitor, but more reluctantly than his brother had done. ' Now I'll tell ye AA'hat \u2014 you tAvo,' he added, after an uneasy pause, turning from Christopher to Ethelberta ancl back again in great earnestness : ' you'd better not bide here, talking to Ave rough ones, you know, for folks might find out that there's something closer betAveen us than Avorkmen and employer and employer's friend. So Berta and Mr. Julian, if you'll go on and take no more notice o' us, in case of visitors, it Avould be Aviser \u2014 else, perhaps, if we should be found out intimate Avith ye, and bring clown your gentility, you'll blame us for it, I get as nervous as a cat when I think I may be the cause of any disgrace to ye.' ' Don't be so silly, Sol,' said Ethelberta, laughing. ' Ah, that's all very well,' said Sol with an unbe lieving smile ; ' but if Ave baint company for you out of doors, you baint company for we within \u2014 not that I find fault with ye or mind it, and shan't take anything for painting your house, nor will Dan neither, any more for that \u2014 no, not a penny; in fact, we are glad to do"], [211, "193 TIIE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. it for ye.

' ' I can but OAvn it,' said Dan. The tAvo brothers then turned their backs upon their visitors, and went on working, and Ethelberta and her lover left the room. ' My brothers, you perceive,' said she, ' represent the respectable British Avorkman in his entirety, and a touchy individual he is, I assure you, on points of dignity, after imbibing a few town ideas from his leaders. They are painfully off-hand Avith me, absolutely refusing to be intimate, from a mistaken notion that I am ashamed of their dress ancl manners ; which, of course, is absurd.' ' Which, of course, is absurd,' said Christopher. ' Of course it is absurd ! ' she repeated with Avarmth, and looking keenly at him. But, finding no harm in his face, she continued as before : ' Yet, all the time, they will do anything under the sun that they think will advance my interests. In our hearts we are one. All they ask me to do is to leave them to themselves, and therefore I do so. Now, would you like to see some more of your acquaintance ?

' I am giving them the rudiments of education here,' said Ethelberta ; ' but I foresee several difficulties in the way of keeping them here, whicli I must get over as best I can. One trouble is, that they don't get enough air and exercise.' ' Is Mrs. Chickerel living here as well ? ' Christo pher ventured to enquire, when they Avere downstairs again. ' Yes ; but confined to her room as usual, I regret to say. Tavo more sisters of mine, whom you have never seen at all, are also here.

It is from a more general cause : simply an underfeeding I have that at the most pro pitious moment the distance to the possibility of sorrow is so short that a man's spirits must not rise higher than mere cheerfulness out of bare respect to his in sight. As long as skies are blue, and fields are green, Evening must usher night, night urge the morrow, Month follow month with Avoe, and year wake year to sorrow.' Ethelberta boAved uncertainly ; the remark might refer to her past conduct or it might not. ' My great cause of uneasiness is the children,' she presently said, as a new page of matter. ' It is my duty, at all risk and all sacrifice of sentiment, to educate ancl provide for them. The grown-up ones, older than myself, I cannot help much, but the little ones I can. I keep my two French lodgers for the sake of them.' ' The lodgers, of course, don't know the relation ship between yourself and the rest of the people in the house ?

' You must improve your Avay of speaking,' she said, with quick embarrassment, whether at the men tion of LadyweU's name before Julian, or at the way Joey coupled herself Avith Christopher, AA-as quite un certain. 'Will you excuse me for a few moments ? ' she said, turning to Christopher. ' Pray sit down ; I shall not be long.' And she glided doAvnstairs. They had been standing just by the draAving-room door, ancl Christopher turned back into the room Avith no A-ery satisfactory countenance. It Avas very odd, he thought, that she should go down to LadyweU in that mysterious manner, Avhen he might have been admitted to where they were talking Avithout any trouble at all.

Julian Avalked up and doAvn the room, every mo ment expanding itself to a minute in his impatience at the delay ancl vexation at the cause. After scrutinising for the fifth time every object on the walls as if afflicted with microscopic closeness of sight, his hands under his coat-tails, and his person jigging up and clown upon his toes, he heard her coming up the stairs. When she entered the apartment her appearance was decidedly that of a person subsiding after some little excitement. ' I did not calculate upon being so long,' she said sAveetly, at the same time throwing back her face and smiling. ' But I \u2014 was longer than I expected.' ' It seemed rather long,' said Christopher, gloomily ; ' but I don't mind it.' ' I am glad of that,' said Ethelberta. ' As you asked me to stay, I was very pleased to do so, and always should be ; but I think that noAv I wdl wish you good-bye.' 'You are not vexed AA'ith me?' she said, looking quite into his face. 'Mr. LadyAvell is nobody, you know.' 'Nobody?'"], [218, "200 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. ' Well, he is not much, I mean.

' May I say,' said Christopher, ' that if you Avant yourself painted, you are ill-adA'ised not to let it be done by a man who knoAvs Iioav to use the brush a little ? ' ' Oh, he can paint !

' Yes, but \u2014 hoAV provoking you are ! \u2014 nobody, I mean, to talk to. He is a true artist, nevertheless.' Christopher made no reply. The warm under standing betAveen them had quite ended now7, aud there was no fanning it up again.

Chris topher Avent downstairs Avith Avell-behaved moodiness, ancl left the house forthwith. The postman came to the door at the same time.

You see, I should be close to you, ancl should have the benefit of your experience. I would not mind Avhat I did for a living could I be there where you all are. It is so like banishment to be here.

When this letter reached its destination the next morning, Picotee, in her over-anxiety, could not bring herself to read it in anybody's presence, and put it in her pocket tiU she Avas on her Avalk across the moor. She still lived at the cottage out of the toAvn, though at some inconvenience to herself, in order to teach at a small village night-school Avhilst still carrying on her larger occupation of pupil-teacher in Sandbourne.

To Avish to get near a man only because he had been kind to her, and had admired her pretty face, and had given her floAvers, to be attached to him all the more because of its hopeless impracticability, Avere things to dream of, not to tell. Picotee was quite an unreasoning animal. Her sister arranged situations for her, told her how to conduct herself in them, Iioav to make up anew, in unobtrusive shapes, the valuable"], [223, "205 TIIE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. wearing apparel she sent from time to time \u2014 so as to provoke neither exasperation in the little gentry, nor superciliousness in the big \u2014 the goodness of which materials had attracted Faith Julian's quiet eyes. Ethel berta did everything for her, in short ; and Picotee obeyed orders with the abstracted ease of mind Avliich people show avIio have their thinking clone for them, ancl put out their troubles as they do their washing. She Avas quite Avilling not to be clever herself, since it was unnecessary Avhile she had a much-admired sister, Avho was clever enough for two people and to spare. This arrangement, by Avhich she gained an un troubled existence in exchange for freedom of wdl, had Avorked very pleasantly for Picotee until the anomaly of falling in love on her own account created a jar in the machinery. Then she began to know how wearing were miserable days, and hoAV much more wearing were miserable nights. She pictured Chris topher in London calling upon her dignified sister (for Ethelberta innocently mentioned his name sometimes in Avriting) and imagined over ancl over again the mutual signs of warm feeling between them. And now Picotee resolved upon a noble course.

To set herself to pray that she might have strength to see him Avithout a pang the lover of her sister, Avho deserved him so much more than herself, would be a grand penance and corrective. After uttering petitions to this effect for several days, she still felt very bad ; indeed, in the psycho logical difficulty of striA'ing for what in her soul she did not desire, rather Avorse, if anything. At last, weary of Avalking the old road and never meeting him, and blank in a general poAverlessness, she Avrote the letter to Ethelberta, which Avas only the last one of a series that had previously been Avritten and torn up. Now this hope had been Avhirled away like thistle down, ancl the case Avas grievous enough to distract a greater stoic than Picotee. The end of it Avas that she left the school on insufficient notice, gave up her cottage home on the plea \u2014 true in the letter \u2014 that she Avas going to join a relative in London, and went off thither by a morning train, leaving her things packed ready to be sent on Avhen she should Avrite for them. Picotee arrived in town late on a cold February afternoon, bearing a small bag in her hand. She crossed Westminster-bridge on foot just after dusk, and saw a luminous haze hanging over each Avell lighted street as it AvithdreAv into distance behind the nearer houses, showing its direction as a train of morning mist shows the course of a distant stream when the stream itself is hidden.

She enquired her way to Connaught Crescent, and betAveen five and six o'clock reached her sister's door. Tavo or three minutes Avere passed in accumulating resolution sufficient to ring the bell, Avhich Avhen at last she did, was not performed in a way at all calcu lated to make the young man Joey hasten to the door. After the lapse of a certain time he did, however, find leisure to stroll and see what the caller might want, out of curiosity to knoAv avIio there could be in London afraid to ring a bell twice. Joey's delight exceeded even his surprise, the ruling maxim of his life being the more the merrier, under all circumstances. The beaming young man was about to run off and announce her upstairs and down stairs, left and right, when Picotee called him hastily to her. In the hall her quick young eye had caught sight of an umbrella Avith a peculiar horn handle \u2014 an umbrella she had been accustomed to meet on Sand bourne Moor on many happy afternoons. Christopher was evidently in the house. ' Joey,' she said, as if she were ready to faint,"], [226, "208 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. ' don't tell Berta I am come. She has company, has she not ? ' ' 0 no only Mr. Julian ! ' said the brother. 'He's quite one of the family.' 'Never mind \u2014 can't I go doAvn into the kitchen with you ? ' she enquired. There had been bliss and misery mingled in those tidings, and she scarcely knew for a moment which way they affected her. What she did know Avas that she had run her dear fox to earth; and a sense of satisfaction at that feat prevented her just now from counting the cost of the performance. ' Does Mr. Julian come to see her very often ? ' said she. ' Oh, yes \u2014 he's always a-coming \u2014 a regular bore to me.' ' A regular Avhat ?

Within a few yards of them was the morning-room door, now standing ajar ; and an intermittent flirtation in soft male and female tones could be heard going on inside. Picotee's lips parted at thus learning the condition of things, and she leant against the stair-newel. ' My ! What's the matter ? ' said Joey. ' If this is London, I don't like it at aU !

' They won't fight ; bless you, they busts out quarrelling like this times and times when they've been over-friendly, but it soon gets straight Avith 'em again.' There was noAv a quick walk across the room, and Joey and his sister drew down their heads out of sight. Then the room door Avas slammed, quick footsteps Avent along the hall, the front door closed just as loudly, ancl Christopher's tread passed into nothing along the pavement.

They got downstairs again ; and when the dinner of the French lady and gentleman had been sent up and cleared aAvay, and also Ethelberta's evening tea (Avhich she formed into a genuine meal, making a dinner of luncheon, Avhen nobody was there, to give less trouble to her servant-sisters), they all sat round the fire. Then the rustle of a dress was heard on the staircase, and squirrel-haired Ethelberta appeared in person. It Avas her custom thus to come clown every spare evening, to teach Joey ancl her sisters something or other \u2014 mostly French, which she spoke fluently ; but the cook and housemaid showed more ambition than inteUigence in acquiring that tongue, though Joey learnt it readily enough. There Avas consternation in the camp for a moment or two, on account of poor Picotee, Ethelberta being not without firmness in matters of discipline. Her eye instantly lighted upon her disobedient sister, now looking tAvice as disobedient as she reaUy was. 'Oh, you are here, Picotee? I am glad to see you,' said the mistress of the house, quietly.

But innocent Picotee was as Avily as a religionist in sly elusions of the letter Avhilst in fringing the spirit of a dictum ; and by talking very softly and earnestly about the Avondrous good she could do by remaining in the house as governess to the chil dren, and playing the part of lady's-maid to her sister at show times, she so far coaxed Ethelberta out of her intentions that she almost accepted the plan as a good one.

It became evident to all the family that some mis understanding had arisen between Ethelberta and Mr. Julian.

If Christopher became cold to- Avards her sister he Avould not come to the house ; if he continued to come it would really be as Ethelberta's lover \u2014 altogether, a pretty game of perpetual check for Picotee.

At first Ethelberta seemed blithe enough without him. One more day went, and he did not come, and then her manner Avas that of apathy. Another day passed, and from fanciful elevations of the eyebrow, and long breathings, it became apparent that Ethel berta had decidedly passed the indifferent stage, and was getting seriously out of sorts about him. Next morning she looked all hope. He did not come that day either, and Ethelberta began to look pale Avith fear. ' Why don't you go out ? ' said Picotee, timidly. ' I can hardly tell : I have been expecting someone.' ' When she comes I must run up to mother at once, must I not ? ' said clever Picotee. ' It is not a lady,' said Ethelberta, blandly. She came then and stood by Picotee, and looked musingly out of the windoAv. ' I may as AveU tell you, perhaps,' she continued. ' It is Mr. Julian. He is \u2014 I suppose \u2014 my lover, in plain English.' ' Ah ! ' said Picotee. ' Whom I am not going to marry until he gets rich.' ' Ah\u2014 how strange !

Picotee recovered from the snubbing which she felt that she deserved, and charged gallantly by saying, with delicate showings of indifference, ' Do you love this Mr. What's -his-name of yours ? ' 'Mr. Julian? Oh, he's a very gentlemanly man. That is, except Avhen he is rude, and ill-uses me, and will not come ancl apologise ! ' ' If I had him \u2014 a lover, I would ask him to come if I wanted him to.' Ethelberta did not give her mind to this remark ; but, drawing a long breath, said, with a pouting laugh, which presaged unreality, ' The idea of his getting indifferent now ! I have been intending to keep him on until I got tired of his attentions, and then put an end to them by marrying him ; but here is he, before he has hardly declared himself, forgetting my existence as much as if he had voAved to love ancl cherish me for life.

The pavements looked Avhite as if mantled Avith snow ; ordinary houses Avere sublimated to the rank of public buildings, public buildings to palaces, and the faces of women Avalking the streets to those of calendared saints and guardian-angels, by the pure bleaching light from the sky. In the quiet little street where opened the private door of the HaU chosen by Ethelberta for her story teUing, a brougham was waiting.

She hastened across to the carriage, when a second thoucht arrested her motion : telling the man-servant and a female inside the brougham to Avait for her, she Avrapped up her features and glided round to the front of the house, Avhere she paused to observe the car riages and cabs driving up to receive the fashionable"], [240, "220 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. croAvd stepping doAvn from the doors. Standing here in the throng which her own talent and ingenuity had draAvn together, she appeared to enjoy herseU by listen ing for a minute or two to the names of several persons of more or less distinction as they were called out, and then regarded attentively the faces of others of lesser degree : to scrutinise the latter Avas, as the event proved, the real object of the journey from round the corner. When nearly everyone had left the doors, she turned back disappointed. Ethelberta had been fancying that her alienated lover Christopher Avas in the back rows to-night, but, as far as could now be observed, the hope ful supposition Avas a false one. When she got round to the back again, a man came forward. It was Ladywell, whom she had spoken to already that evening. ' AUow me to bring you your note-book, Mrs. Petherwin : I think you had forgotten it,' he said. ' I assure you that nobody has handled it but myself.' Ethelberta thanked him, and took the book. ' I use it to look into between the parts, in case my memory should fail me,' she explained. 'I remember that I did lay it down, now you remind me.' Ladywell had apparently more to say, and moved by her side towards the carriage ; but she declined the arm he offered, and said not another Avord till he Avent on, haltingly : ' Your triumph to-night Avas very great, and it was"], [241, "221 TIIE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. as much a triumph to me as to you ; I cannot express my feeling \u2014 I cannot say half that I would. If I might only ' 'Thank you much,' said Ethelberta, Avith dignity. 'Thank you for bringing my book, but I must go home now. I know that you will see that it is not necessary for us to be talking here.' ' Yes \u2014 you are quite right,' said the repressed young painter, struck by her seriousness. ' Blame me ; I ought to have known better. But perhaps a man \u2014 well, I will say it \u2014 a lover Avithout indiscretion is no lover at aU. Circumspection and devotion are a con tradiction in terms. I saw that, and hoped that I might speak without real harm. ' You calculated how to be uncalculating, and are natural by art ! ' she said, Avith the shghtest accent of sarcasm. ' But pray do not attend me further \u2014 it is not at all necessary or desirable. My maid is in the carriage.' She boAved, turned, and entered the vehicle, seating herself beside Picotee. ' It was harsh ! ' said LadyAvell to himself, as he looked after the retreating carriage. 'I was a fool; but it Avas harsh. Yet what man on earth likes a woman to show too great a readiness at first ? She is right : she Avould be nothing without repulse !

' The shght depression at finding that Christopher was not present, which had followed Ethelberta's pubhc triumph that evening, was covered over, if not removed, by Ladywell's declaration, and she reached home serene in spirit. That she had not the slightest notion of accepting the impulsive painter made little difference ; a lover's arguments being apt to affect a lady's mood as much by measure as by Aveight. A useless declaration, hke a rare china tea-cup with a hole in it, has its orna mental value in enlarging a collection.

' Is he the man you punished the Aveek before last by forbidding him to come ? ' ' Perhaps he is ; but he does not Avant civility from me. Where there's much feeling, there's little cere mony.' ' It certainly seems that he does not want civility from you to make him attentive to you,' said Picotee, stifling a sigh ; ' for here is a letter in his handAvriting, I believe.' ' You might have given it to me at once,' said Ethelberta, opening the envelope hastily. It contained very feAV sentences : they Avere to the effect that Chris topher had received her letter forbidding him to call ; that he had therefore at first resolved not to call or ever see her more, since he had become such a shadoAv in her path. Still, as it Avas ahvays best to do nothing hastily, he had on second thoughts decided to ask her to grant him a last special favour, and see him again just once, for a few minutes only that afternoon, in which he might at least say Farewell. To avoid all possibility of compromising her in anybody's eyes, he would call at half-past six, when other callers were hkely to be gone, knowing that from the peculiar constitution of her household the hour would not inter fere Avith her arrangements. There being no time for an answer, he would assume that she Avould see him,"], [258, "238 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. and keep the engagement ; the request being one which could not rationally be objected to. ' There read it ! ' said Ethelberta, with glad dis pleasure. ' Did you ever hear such audacity ? Fixing a time so soon that I cannot reply, and thus making capital out of a pretended necessity, when it is really an arbitrary arrangement of his OAvn. That's real rebellion \u2014 forcing himself into my house AA'hen I said strictly he Avas not to come ; and then, that it cannot rationally be objected to \u2014 I don't like his \" rationady.\" ' 'Where there's much love there's httle cere mony, didn't you say just iioav?' observed innocent Picotee. ' And where there's httle love, no ceremony at all. These manners of his are dreadful, and I believe he Avill never improve. ' It makes you care not a bit about him, does it not, Berta ? ' said Picotee, hopefully. ' I don't answer for that,' said Ethelberta. ' I feel, as many others do, that a blindness to ceremony which is produced by abstraction of mind is no defect in a poet or musician, fatal as it may be to an ordinary nian.' ' Mighty me ! You soon forgive him.' ' Picotee, don't you be so quick to speak. Before I have finished, how do you know what I am going to say? I'll never tell you anything again, if you take me up so. Of course I am going to punish him at"], [259, "THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 239 once, and make him remember that I am a lady, even if I do hke him a little.' ' How do you mean to punish him ? ' said Picotee, with interest. ' By writing and telling him that on no account is he to come.' ' But there is not time for a letter \u2014 ' That doesn't matter. It AviU show him that I did not mean him to come.' At hearing the very merciful nature of the punish ment, Picotee sighed Avithout replying ; and Ethelberta despatched her note. The hour of appointment drew near, and Ethelberta showed symptoms of unrest. Six o'clock struck and passed. She Avalked here and there for nothing, and it Avas plain that a dread was filling her : her letter might accidentally have had, in addition to the moral effect which she had intended, the practical effect which she did not intend, by arriving before, instead of after, his purposed visit to her, thereby stopping him in spite of all her care. ' How long are letters going to Bloomsbury ? ' she said, suddenly. 'Tavo hours, Joey tells me,' replied Picotee, Avho had already enquired on her own private account. ' There ! ' exclaimed Ethelberta, petulantly. ' Hoav I dislike a man to misrepresent things ! He said there was not time for a reply ! '"], [260, "240 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. ' Perhaps he didn't knoAV,' said Picotee, in angel tones ; ' and so it happens all right, and he has got it, and he will not come after all.' They Avaited and waited, but Christopher did not appear that night ; the true case being that his declar ation about insufficient time for a reply was merely an ingenious suggestion to her not to be so cruel as to for bid him. He was far from suspecting when the letter of denial did reach him \u2014 about an hour before the time of appointment \u2014 that it was sent by a refinement of art, of which the real intention Avas futility, and that but for his OAvn mis-statement it Avould have been care fully delayed. The next day another letter came from the musician, decidedly short and to the point. The irate lover stated that he Avould not be made a fool of any longer : under any circumstances he meant to come that self-same afternoon, and should decidedly expect her to see him. ' I will not see him ! ' said Ethelberta. ' Why did he not call last night ? ' ' Because you told him not to,' said Picotee. ' Good gracious, as if a Avoman's words are to be translated as literally as Homer ! Surely he is aware that more often than not \" No \" is said to a man's im portunities because it is traditionally the correct modest reply, and for notliing else in the world. If all men took words as superficially as he does, Ave should die of decorum in shoals.'"], [261, "241 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. ' Ah, Berta ! hoAV could you Avrite a letter that you did not mean should be obeyed ? ' ' I did in a measure mean it, although I could have shown Christian forgiveness if it had not been. Never mind ; I AviU not see him. I'll plague my heart for the credit of my sex.' To ensure the fulfilment of this resolve, Ethelberta determined to give way to a headache that she was beginning to be aware of, go to her room, disorganise her dress, ancl ruin her hair by lying doAvn ; so putting it out of her power to descend ancl meet Christopher on any momentary impulse. Picotee sat in the room with her, reading, or pre tending to read, and Ethelberta pretended to sleep. Christopher's knock came up the stairs, and Avith it the end of the farce. ' I'll tell you what,' said Ethelberta, in the prompt ancl broadly-aAvake tone of one who had been concen trated on the expectation of that sound for a length of time, ' it was a mistake in me to do this ! Joey will be sure to make a muddle of it.' Joey Avas heard coming up the stairs. Picotee opened the door, and said, Avith an anxiety transcend ing Ethelberta's, ' Well ? ' ' Oh, will you tell Mrs. Petherwin that Mr. Julian says he'll wait.' ' You were not to ask him to wait,' said Ethelberta within. it vol. I."], [262, "242 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. ' I know that,' said Joey, ' and I didn't. He's doing that out of his own head.' ' Then let Mr. Julian wait, by all means,' said Ethelberta. ' AUoav him to Avait if he likes, but tell him it is uncertain if I shall be able to come down.' Joey then retired, and the two sisters remained in silence. ' I wonder if he's gone,' Ethelberta said at the end of a long time. ' I thought you were asleep,' said Picotee. ' Shall we ask Joey ? I have not heard the door close.' Joey was summoned, and after a leisurely ascent, interspersed by various gymnastic performances over the handrail here and there, appeared again. ' He's there jest the same : he don't seem to be in no hurry at all,' said Joey. ' What is he doing ? ' enquired Picotee, solicitously. ' Oh, only looking at his watch sometimes, and humming tunes, and playing rat-a-tat-tat upon the table. He says he don't mind Avaiting a bit.' ' You must have made a mistake in the message,' said Ethelberta within. ' Well, no. I am correct as a jineral thing. I jest said perhaps you would be engaged all the evening, and perhaps you wouldn't.' When Joey had again retired, and they had waited another ten minutes, Ethelberta said, ' Picotee, do you go doAvn and speak a few words to him. I am deter-"], [263, "243 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. mined he shall not see me. You know him a little : you remember when he came to the Lodge ? ' ' What must I say to him ? ' Ethelberta paused before replying. ' Try to find out if \u2014 if he is much grieved at not seeing me, and say \u2014 give him to understand that I will forgive him, Picotee.' ' Very well.' ' And Picotee ' Yes.' ' If he says he must see me \u2014 I think I wdl get up. But only if he says must : you remember that.' Picotee departed on her errand. She paused ou the staircase trembling, and thinking between the thrills how very far would have been the conduct of her poor slighted self from proud recalcitration had Mr. Julian's gentle request been addressed to her instead of to Ethelberta ; and she went some way in the painful discovery of hoAV much more tantalising it was to watch an envied situation that was held by another than to be out of sight of it altogether. Here was Christopher waiting to bestow love, and Ethelberta not going doAvn to receive it : a commodity unequalled in value by any other in the whole wide world was being Avantonly wasted within that very house. If she could only have stood to-night as the beloved Ethel berta, and not as the despised Picotee, how different Avould be this going down ! Thus she went along, red R 2"], [264, "244 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. and pale moving in her cheeks as in the Northern Lights at their strongest time. MeaiiAvhile Christopher had sat Avaiting minute by minute till the evening shades grew broAvner, and the fire sank Ioav. Joey, finding himself not particularly wanted upon the premises after the second enquiry, had slipped out to witness a nigger performance round the corner, and Julian began to think himself forgotten by all the household. The perception graduaUy cooled his emotions, and enabled him to hold his hat quite steadily. When Picotee gently thrust open the door she was surprised to find the room in darkness, the fire gone completely out, and the form of Christopher only visible by a faint patch of light, Avhich, coming from a lamp on the opposite side of the way and falling upon the mirror, Avas thrown as a pale nebulosity upon his shoulder. Picotee Avas too flurried at sight of the familiar outline to 1_iioav what to do, and, instead of going or calling for a light, she mechanically advanced into the room. Christopher did not turn or move in any way, and then she perceived that he had be^un to doze in his chair. Instantly, Avith the precipitancy of the timorous she said, ' Mr. Julian ! ' and touched him on the shoulder \u2014 murmuring then, ' Oh, I beg pardon, I I will get a light.' Christopher's consciousness returned, and his first"], [265, "245 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. act, before rising, was to exclaim, in a confused man ner, ' Ah \u2014 you have come \u2014 thank you, Berta ! ' then impulsively to seize her hand, as it hung beside his head, and kiss it warmly. He stood up, still holding her fingers. Picotee gasped out something, but was completely deprived of articulate utterance, and in another mo ment, being unable to control herself at this sort of first meeting with the man she had gone through fire and water to be near, and more particularly by the overpowering kiss upon her hand, not meant for hers at all, burst into hysterical sobbing. Julian, in his inability to imagine so much emotion \u2014 or at least the exhibition of it \u2014 in Ethelberta, gently chew Picotee further forward by the hand he held, ancl utilised the solitary spot of light from the mirror by making it fall upon her face. Recognising the childish features, he at once, with an exclamation, dropped her hand and started back. Being in point of fact a complete bundle of nerves ancl nothing else, his thin figure shook like a harp-string in painful excitement at a contretemps which would scarcely have quickened the pulse of an ordinary man. Poor Picotee, feeling herself in the wind of a civil d , started back also, sobbing more than ever. It was a little too much that the first result of his dis covery of the mistake should be absolute repulse. She leant against the mantelpiece, when Julian, much be-"], [266, "246 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. wildered at her superfluity of emotion, assisted her to a seat in sheer humanity. But Christopher Avas by no means pleased when he again thought round the circle of circumstances. ' How could you alloAv such an absurd thing to happen ? ' he said, in a stern, though trembhng voice. ' You knew I might mistake. I had no idea you were in the house : I thought you were miles away, at Sand bourne or somewhere ! But I see : it is just done for a joke, ha-ha ! ' This made Picotee rather worse still. ' O-o-o-oh ! ' she rephed, in the tone of pouring from a bottle. ' What shall I do-o-o-o ! It is \u2014 not done for a \u2014 joke at aU-1-1-1 ! ' ' Not done for a joke ? Then never mind \u2014 don't cry, Picotee. What Avas it done for, I Avonder ? ' Picotee, mistaking the purport of his enquiry, imagined him to refer to her arrival in the house, quite forgetting, in her guilty sense of having come on his account, that he would have no right or thought of asking questions about a natural visit to a sister, and she said : ' When you \u2014 went away from \u2014 Sandbourne, I \u2014 I \u2014 I didn't know what to do, and then I ran away, and came here, and then Ethelberta \u2014 was angry with me ; but she says I may stay ; but she doesn't know \u2014 that I know you, and Iioav avc used to meet along the road every morning \u2014 and I am afraid to tell her \u2014 Oh, what shall I clo ! '"], [267, "247 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. ' Never mind it,' said Christopher, a sense of the true state of her case daAvning upon him with unpleasant distinctness, and bringing some irritation at his aAvkward position ; though it Avas impossible to be long angry with a girl who had not reasoning foresight enough to perceive that doubtful pleasure ancl certain pain must be the result of any meeting whilst hearts Avere at cross purposes in this way. 'Where is your sister? ' he asked. ' She wouldn't come down, unless she must,' said Picotee. ' You have vexed her, ancl she has a head ache besides that, and I came instead.' ' So that I mightn't be wasted altogether. Well, it's a strange business between the three of us. I have heard of one-sided love, and reciprocal love, ancl all sorts, but this is my first experience of a concatenated affection. You foUow me, I folloAv Ethelberta, and she foUows \u2014 Heaven knows who ! ' ' Mr. Ladywell ! ' said the mortified Picotee. ' Good Lord, if I didn't think so ! ' said Christopher, feehng to the soles of his feet like a man in a legitimate drama. ' No, no, no ! ' said the frightened girl, hastily. ' I am not sure it is Mr. LadyAvell. That's altogether a mistake of mine ! ' ' Ah, yes, you Avant to screen her,' said Christopher, with a withering smile at the spot of hght. ' Very sisterly, doubtless ; but none of that wiU do for me. I"], [268, "248 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA am too old a bird by far \u2014 by very far ! Now are you sure she does not love Ladywell ? ' ' Yes ! ' ' Well, perhaps I blame her Avrongly. She may have some little faith in her \u2014 a woman has, here and there. Hoav do you know she does not love LadyAvell ? ' ' Because she would prefer Mr. Neigh to him, any day.' 'Ha!' No, no \u2014 you mistake, sir \u2014 she doesn't love either at all \u2014 Ethelberta doesn't. I meant that she cannot love Mr. LadyAvell because he stands loAver in her opinion than Mr. Neigh, and him she certainly does not care for. She only loves you. If you only kneAv how true she is you wouldn't be so suspicious about her, and I wish I had not come here \u2014 yes, I do ! ' ' I cannot tell what to think of it. Perhaps I don't know much of this world after aU, or what girls wiU do. But you don't excuse her to me, Picotee.' Before this time Picotee had been simulating haste in getting a light ; but in her dread of appearing visibly to Christopher's ej'es, and showing him the precise condition of her tear-stained face, she put it off moment after moment, and stirred the fire, in hope that the faint illumination thus produced Avould be sufficient to save her from the charge of stupid conduct as enter tainer."], [269, "TUE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 249 Fluttering about on the horns of this dilemma, she was greatly relieved Avhen Christopher, who read her difficulty, ancl the general painfulness of the situation, said that since Ethelberta was really suffering from a headache he would not wish to disturb her till to morrow, and went off doAvnstairs and into the street Avithout further ceremony. Meanwhile other things had transpired upstairs. No sooner had Picotee left her sister's room, than Ethelberta thought it Avould after all have been much better if she had gone down herself to speak to this admirably persistent lover. Was she not drifting some what into the character of coquette, even if her ground of offence \u2014 a Avord of Christopher's about somebody else's mean parentage, Avhich Avas spoken in utter forget fulness of her oavii position, but had Avounded her to the quick nevertheless \u2014 was to some extent a tenable one ? She knew what facilities in suffering Christopher always showed ; how a touch to other people was a bloAv to him, a bloAv to them his deep Avound, although he took such pains to look stolid and unconcerned under those inflictions, and tried to smile as if he had no feelings Avhatever. It would be more generous to go down to him, ancl be kind. She jumped up with that alertness which comes so spontaneously at those sweet bright times Avhen desire and duty run hand in hand. She hastily set her hair and dress in order \u2014 not"], [270, "250 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. such matchless order as she could have wished them to be in, but time was precious \u2014 and descended the stairs. When on the point of pushing open the draw ing-room door, whicli Avanted about an inch of being closed, she Avas astounded to discover that the room was in total darkness, and still more to hear Picotee sobbing inside. To retreat again was the only action she was capable of at that moment : the clash between this picture and the anticipated scene of Picotee and Christopher sitting in frigid propriety at opposite sides of a well-lighted room was too great. She flitted up stafrs again Avith the least possible rustle, and flung herseU down on the couch as before, panting with excitement at the new knoAvledge that had come to her. There was only one possible construction to be put upon this in Ethelberta's rapid mind, and that approxi mated to the true one. She had known for some time that Picotee once had a lover, or something akin to it, and that he had disappointed her in a way Avhich had never been told. No stranger, save iu the capacity of the one beloved, could wound a woman sufficiently to make her weep, and it followed that Christopher was the man of Picotee's choice. As Ethelberta recalled the conversations, conclusion after conclusion came hke pulsations in an aching head. ' Oh, Iioav did it happen, and who is to blame ? ' she exclaimed. ' I cannot doubt"], [271, "251 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. his faith, and I cannot doubt hers ; and yet how can I keep doubting them both ?

CHAPTER XXV. ethelberta's house \u2014 {continued). Picotee was heard on the stairs : Ethelberta covered her face. 'Is he Avaiting?' she said faintly, on finding that Picotee did not begin to speak. ' No ; he is gone,' said Picotee. ' Ah, why is that ? ' came quickly from under the handkerchief. ' He has forgotten me \u2014 that's what it is ! ' ' Oh no, he has not ! ' said Picotee just as bitterly. Ethelberta had far too much heroism to let much in this strain escape her, though her sister was prepared to go any lengths in the same. ' I suppose,' continued Ethelberta, in the quiet way of one who had only a headache the matter Avith her, ' that he remembered you after the meeting at Anglebury ? ' ' Yes, he remembered me.' ' Did you tell me you had seen him before that time ? ' ' I had seen him at Sandbourne. I don't think I told you.'"], [273, "THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 253 ' At whose house did you meet him ? ' ' At nobody's. I only saAV him sometimes,' replied Picotee, in great distress. Ethelberta, though of all Avomen most miserable, was brimming with compassion for the throbbing girl so nearly related to her, in Avhom she continually saw her own weak points Avithout the counterpoise of her strong ones. But it was necessary to repress herself awhile : the intended Avays of her life were blocked ancl broken up by this jar of interests, and she wanted time to ponder new plans. ' Picotee, I would rather be alone now, if you don't mind,' she said. ' You need not leave me any light ; it makes my eyes ache, I think.' Picotee left the room. But Ethelberta had not long been alone and in darkness when somebody gently opened the door, and entered Avithout a candle. ' Berta,' said the soft voice of Picotee again, ' may I come in ? ' ' Oh, yes,' said Ethelberta. ' Has everything gone right with the house this evening ? ' ' Yes ;, and Gwendoline went out just uoav to buy a few things, and she is going to call round upon father when he has got his dinner cleared away.' 'I hope she will not stay and talk to the other servants. Some day she will let drop something or other before father can stop her.' ' Oh, Berta ! ' said Picotee, close beside her. She"], [274, "254 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. was kneeling in front of the couch, and now flinging her arm across Ethelberta's shoulder and shaking violently, she pressed her forehead against her sister's temple, and breathed out upon her cheek : ' I came in again to tell you something which I ought to have told you just now, and I have come to say it at once because I am afraid I shan't be able to to-morrow.

Ethelberta descended to the kitchen, it being now about ten o'clock. The room was empty, GAvendoline not having yet returned, and Cornelia being busy about her OAvn affairs upstairs. The French family had gone to the theatre, and the house on that account was very quiet to-night. Ethelberta sat doAvn in the dismal place Avithout turning up the gas, and in a feAV minutes admitted Gwendoline. The round-faced country cook floundered in, un tying her bonnet as she came, laying it doAvn on a chair, and talking at the same time. ' Such a place as this London is, to be sure !

As she ascended the stairs, Ethelberta ached with an added pain not much less than the primary one whicli had brought her down. It was that old sense of disloyalty to her class and kin by feeling as she felt now Avhich caused the pain, and there was no escaping it.

' I am so glad \u2014 I Avas just coming down,' Cornelia said in a Avhisper ; whenever they spoke as relations in this house it was in Avhispers. 'Noav, how do you think this bonnet will do ? May I come down, and see Iioav I look in your big glass ? ' She clapped the bonnet upon her head. ' Won't it do beautiful for Sunday afternoon ? '"], [279, "259 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. ' It looks very attractive, as far as I can see by this light,' said Ethelberta. ' But is it not rather too bril liant in colour\u2014 blue and red together, like that? Remember, as I often tell you, people in town never Avear such bright contrasts as they do in the country.' ' 0, Berta ! ' said Cornelia, in a deprecating tone ; ' don't object. If there's one thing I do glory in it is a nice flare-up about my head o' Sundays \u2014 of course if the family's not in mourning, I mean.' But, seeing that Ethelberta did not smile, she turned the subject, and added docilely : ' Did you come up for me to do anything ? I will put off finishing my bonnet if I am wanted.' ' I was going to talk to you about family matters, and Pictoee,' said Ethelberta. ' But, as you are busy, and I have a headache, I will put it off till to-morrow.' Cornelia seemed decidedly relieved, for family matters were far from attractive at the best of times ; and Ethelberta went down to the next floor, and entered her mother's room. After a short conversation Mrs. Chickerel said, ' You say you want to ask me something ? ' ' Yes ; but nothing of importance, mother. I was thinking about Picotee, and what would be the best thing to do ' ' Ah, well you may, Berta.

I know you are doing your best ; but I cannot help thinking that the coming to London and living Avith you Avas wild and rash, and not well weighed afore we set about it. You should have counted the cost first, and not advised it. If you break down, and we are all discovered living so queer and unnatural, right in the heart of the aristocracy, we should be the laughing-stock of the country : it would kill me, and ruin us all \u2014 utterly ruin us ! ' ' Oh, mother, I knoAv all that so wrell ! ' exclaimed Ethelberta, tears of anguish filling her eyes. ' Don't depress me more than I depress myseU by such fears, or you will bring about the very thing we strive to avoid ! My only chance is in keeping in good spirits ; and why don't you try to help me a little by taking a brighter vieAv of things ?

People wiU find you out as one of a family of servants, and their pride will be stung at having gone to hear your ro manciug; then they Avill go no more, ancl Avhat will happen to us and the poor little ones ?

Mrs. Chickerel, in deploring the risks of their present speculative mode of life, was far from imagining that signs of the foul future so much dreaded were actually apparent to Ethelberta at the time the lament was spoken. Hence the daughter's uncommon sensitiveness to prophecy. It was as if a dead-reckoner poring over his chart should remark that breakers were possible ahead to one who already beheld them. That her story-telling Avould prove so attractive Ethelberta had not ventured to expect for a moment when she first originated the undertaking ; that having once proved attractive there should be any falling-off until such time had elapsed as would enable her to harvest some solid fruit by her labour was equally a surprise. Future expectations are often based without hesitation upon one happy accident, when the only similar condition remaining to subsequent sets of cir cumstances is that the same person forms the centre os' them. Her situation was so peculiar, and so unlike"], [284, "264 THE hand of ethelberta. that of most public people, that there was hardly an argument explaining this triumphant opening which could be used in a fair calculation as to its close ; unless, indeed, more strategy Avere employed in the conduct of the campaign than Ethelberta seemed to show at present. There Avas no denying that she commanded less attention than at first : the audience had lessened, and, judging by appearances, might soon be expected to be decidedly thin. Iu excessive loAAmess of spirit, Ethel berta translated these signs Avith the bias that a linger ing echo of her mother's dismal words naturaUy in duced, reading them as conclusive evidence that her adventure had been chimerical in its birth. Yet it was very far less conclusive than she supposed. Public interest might without doubt have been renewed after a due interval, some of the falling-off being only an accident of the season. Her novelties had been hailed with pleasure the rather that their freshness tickled than that their intrinsic merit was appreciated ; and, like many inexperienced dispensers of a unique charm, Ethelberta, by bestowing too liberally and too fre quently, was destroying the A'ery element upon whicli its popularity depended. Her entertainment, had been good in its conception, and partly good in its execution ; yet her success had but little to do with that goodness. Indeed, what might be called its badness in a histrionic sense \u2014 that is, her look sometimes of being out of place,"], [285, "the hand of ethelberta. 265 the sight of a beautiful Avoman on a platform, revealing tender airs of domesticity which showed her to belong by character to a quiet drawing-room \u2014 had been pri marily an attractive feature. But alas, custom was staling this by improving her up to the mark of an utter impersonator, thereby eradicating the pretty abash ments of a poetess out of her sphere ; and more than one well-wisher who observed Ethelberta from afar feared that it might some day come to be said of her that she had Enfeoffed herself to popularity : That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes, They surfeited with honey, and began To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little More than a little is by much too much. But this in its extremity was not quite yet. We discover her one day, a little after this time, sitting before a table strewed with accounts and bills from different tradesmen of the neighbourhood, Avhich she examined with a pale face, collecting their totals on a blank sheet. Picotee came into the room, but Ethelberta took no notice whatever of her. The younger sister, who subsisted on scraps of notice and favour, like a dependent animal, even if these were only an occasional glance of the eye, could not help saying at last, ' Berta, how silent you are. I don't think you know I am in the room.'"], [286, "266 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. ' I did not observe you,' said Ethelberta. ' I am very much engaged : these bills have to be paid.' 'What, and cannot we pay them?' said Picotee, in vague alarm. ' Oh yes, I can pay them. The question is, how long shall I be able to do it.' ' That is sad ; and we are going on so nicely, too. It is not true that you have really decided to leave off story-telling now the people don't croAvd to hear it as they did ? ' ' I think I shall leave ofl'.' ' And begin again next year ? ' ' That is very doubtful.' ' I'll tell you what you might do,' said Picotee, her face kindling Avith a sense of great originality. ' You might travel about to country towns and teU your story splendidly.' ' A man in my position might perhaps do it with impunity ; but I could not without losing ground in other domains. A woman may drive to Mayfair from her house in Connaught Crescent, and speak from a platform there, and be supposed to do it as an original way of amusing herself; but when it comes to starring in the provinces she estabhshes herself as a woman of a different breed and habit. I wish I Avere a man ! I would give up this house, advertise it to be let furnished, and sally forth with confidence. But I am driven to think of other ways to manage than that.'"], [287, "TIIE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 267 Picotee fell into a conjectural look, but could not guess. ' The Avay of marriage,' said Ethelberta. ' Other wise perhaps the poetess may live to become what Dryden called himself when he got old and poor \u2014 a rent-charge on Providence. . . . Yes, I must try that way,' she continued, with a sarcasm toAvards people out of hearing. ' I must buy a \"Peerage\" for one thing, ancl a \"Baronetage,\" and a \"House of Commons,\" and a \"Landed Gentry,\" and learn what people are about me. I must go to Doctors' Commons and read up wills of the parents of any likely gudgeons I may know. I must get a Herald to invent an escutcheon of my family, and throw a genealogical tree into the bargain in consider ation of my taking a few second-hand heirlooms of a pawnbroking friend of his. I must get up sham ances tors, and find out some notorious name to start my pedigree from. It does not matter what his character was : either villain or martyr will do, provided that he lived five hundred years ago. It would be considered far more creditable to make good my descent from Satan in the age when he went to and fro on the earth than from a ministering angel under Victoria.' ' But, Berta, you are not going to marry any stranger who may turn up ? ' said Picotee, who had creeping sensations of dread when Ethelberta talked like this. ' I had no such intention. But, having once put my hand to the plough, how shall I turn back ? '"], [288, "268 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. ' You might marry Mr. LadyAvell,' said Picotee, who preferred a return to the concrete. ' Yes, marry him villanously ; in cold blood, Avith out a moment to prepare himself ' Ah, you won't ! ' ' I am not so sure about that.

I must prove my promises, ev7en if Heaven should fall upon me for it, or Avhat a miserable future will theirs be ! We must not be poor in London.

' I see it ; and you ought to marry before the house is gone, if you mean to marry high,' murmured Picotee in an inadequate voice, as one in a world so tragic that any hope of her assisting therein was out of the question. It Avas not long after this exposition of the family affairs that Christopher called upon them ; but Picotee was not present, having gone to think of superhuman work on the spur of Ethelberta's awakening talk. There was something neAv in the Avay in which Ethel berta received the announcement of his name ; passion had to do with it, so had circumspection ; the latter most, for the first time since their re-union. ' I am going to leave this part of England,' said Christopher, after a few gentle preliminaries. ' I Avas one of the applicants for the post of assistant organist at Melchester Cathedral when it became vacant, and I find I am likely to be chosen, through the interest of one of my father's friends.' ' I congratulate you.' ' No, Ethelberta, it is not AA'orth that. I did not originally mean to folloAv this course at all ; but events seemed to point to it in the absence of a better.' ' I too am compelled to folloAv a course I did not originally mean to take.' After saying no more for a few moments, she added, in a tone of sudden openness, a richer tincture creeping up her cheek, ' I want to put a question to you boldly \u2014 not exactly a question \u2014 a thought. Have you considered Avhether the relations"], [290, "270 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. between us which have lately prevaded are \u2014 are the best for you \u2014 and for me ? ' ' I know what you mean,' said Christopher, hastily anticipating all that she might be going to say ; ' and I am glad you have given me the opportunity of speaking upon that subject. It has been very good and con siderate in you to allow me to share your society so frequently as you have done since I have been in towm, and to think of you as an object to exist for and strive for. But I ought to have remembered that, since you have nobody at your side to look after your interests, it behoved me to be doubly careful. In short, Ethel berta, I am not in a position to marry, nor can I discern when I shall be, and I feel it would be an injustice to ask you to be bound in any Avay to one lower ancl less talented than you. You cannot, from what you say, think it desirable that the engagement should continue. I have no right to ask you to be my betrothed, Avithout having a near prospect of making you my wife. I don't mind saying this straight out \u2014 I have no fear that you wiU doubt my love ; thank Heaven, you know what that is well enough ! However, as things are, I wish you to knoAv that I cannot conscientiously put in a claim upon your attention.' A second meaning Avas Avritten in Christopher's look, though he scarcely uttered it. A woman so delicately poised upon the social globe cotdd not in honour be asked to wait for a lover who was unable to set bounds"], [291, "271 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. to the waiting period. Yet he had privily dreamed of an approach to that position \u2014 an unreserved, ideally perfect declaration from Ethelberta that time and prac tical issues Avere nothing to her ; that she would stand as fast without material hopes as with them ; that love was to be an end with her henceforth, having utterly ceased to be a means. Therefore this surreptitious hope of his, founded on no reasonable expectation, was hke a guilty thing surprised when Ethelberta answered, with a predominance of judgment over passion still greater than before : ' It is unspeakably generous in you to put it all before me so nicely, Christopher. I think infinitely more of you for being so unreserved, especially since I too have been thinking much on the indefiniteness of the days to come. We are not numbered among the blest few who can afford to trifle with the time. Yet to agree to anything like a positive parting will be quite unnecessary. You did not mean that, did you ? for it is harsh if you did.' Ethelberta smiled kindly as she said this, as much as to say that she was far from really upbraiding him. ' Let it be only that Ave will see each other less. We will bear one another in mind as deeply attached friends if not as definite lovers, and keep up friendly remembrances of a sort which, come what may, will never have to be ended by any painful process termed breaking off. Different persons, differ ent natures ; and it may be that marriage would not be"], [292, "272 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. the most favourable atmosphere for our old affection to prolong itself in. When do you leave London ? ' The disconnected query seemed to be subjoined to disperse the crude effect of Avhat had gone before. ' I hardly know,' murmured Christopher. ' I sup pose I shall not call here again.' Whilst they A\\rere silent somebody entered the room softly, and they turned to discover Picotee. ' Come here, Picotee,' said Ethelberta. Picotee came with an abashed bearing to Avhere the other two were standing, and looked down stedfastly. 'Mr. Julian is going aAvay,' she continued, with determined firmness. ' He will not see us again for a long time.' And Ethelberta added, in a loAver tone, though still in the unflinching manner of one who had set herself to say a thing, and Avould say it \u2014 ' He is not to be definitely engaged to me any lonoer. We are not thinking of marrying, you know, Picotee. It is best that Ave shoidd not.' ' Perhaps it is,' said Christopher, hurriedly, taking up his hat. ' Let me noAv Avish you good-bye ; and, of course, you AviU ahvays know Avhere I am and Iioav to find me.' It was a tender time. He inclined fonvard that Ethelberta might give him her hand, Avhich she did ; whereupon their eyes met. Mastered by an impelling instinct she had not reckoned with, Ethelberta pre sented her cheek. Christopher kissed it faintly. Tears"], [293, "It was a tender time"], [294, ""], [295, "273 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. were in Ethelberta's eyes now, and she was heartfull of many emotions. Placing her arm round Picotee's waist, Avho had never lifted her eyes from the carpet, she drew the slight girl forward, and Avhispered quickly to him \u2014 \u25a0' Kiss her, too. She is my sister, and I am yours.' It seemed all right and natural to their respective moods and the tone of the moment that free old Wessex manners should prevail, and Christopher stooped and dropped upon Picotee's cheek likewise such a fareAvell kiss as he had imprinted upon Ethel berta's. ' Care for us both equally ! ' said Ethelberta. ' I will,' said Christopher, scarcely kuoAving what he said. When he had reached the door of the room, he looked back and saw the two sisters standing as he had left them, ancl equally tearful. Ethelberta at once said, in a last futde struggle against letting him go altogether, and with thoughts of her sister's heart : ' I think that Picotee might correspond Avith Faith ; don't you, Mr. Julian ? They know each other.' ' My sister would much hke to do so,' said he. 'And you Avould like it too, would you not, Picotee ? ' ' Oh, yes,' she replied. ' Ancl I can tell them all about you.'

He coidd scarcely believe as he walked along that those late Avords, yet hanging in his ears, had really been spoken, that still visible scene enacted. He could not eveu recollect for a minute or tAvo how the final result had been produced. Did he himself first enter upon the long-looming theme, or did she ? Christopher had been so nervously alive to the urgency of setting before the hard-striving Avoman a clear outline of him- self, his surroundings and his fears, that he fancied the main impulse to this consummation had been his, not- Avithstanding that a faint initiative had come from Ethelberta. All had completed itself quickly, uncere- moniously, and easily. Ethelberta had let him \"o a second time ; yet on foregoing mornings and evenings, when contemplating the necessity of some such explan- ation, it had seemed that nothing less than Atlantean force could overpoAver their mutual gravitation towards each other again. On his reaching home Faitli was not in the house, and, iu the restless state which demands something to talk at, the musician went off to find her, AveU knowing her haunt at this time of the day. He entered the spiked and gilded gateway of the Museum hard by, turned to the Aving devoted to sculptures, and descended"], [297, "275 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. to a particular basement room, which was lined Avith bas-reliefs from Nineveh. The place was cool, silent, and soothing ; it was empty, save of a little figure in black, that was standing with its face to the wall in au innermost nook. This spot was Faith's oavii temple ; here, among these deserted antiques, Faith was ahvays happy. Christopher looked on at her for some time before she noticed him, and dimly perceived how vastly differed her homely suit and unstudied contour \u2014 pain fully unstudied to fastidious eyes \u2014 from Ethelberta's Avell-arranged draperies, even from Picotee's clever bits of ribbon, by which she made herself look pretty out of nothing at all. Yet thi3 negligence Avas his sister's essence ; AA'ithout it she Avould have been a spoilt product. She had no outer Avorld, and her rusty black Avas as appropriate to Faith's unseen courses as Avere Ethelberta's correct lights and shades to her more prominent career. ' Look, Kit,' said Faith, as soon as she knew avIio Avas approaching, 'This is a thing I never learnt before ; this person is really Sennacherib, sitting on his throne ; ancl these with fluted beards and hair like l dough-furrows, and fingers with no bones in them, are his Avarriors \u2014 really carved at the time, you know7.

And Hezekiah, King of Judah, sent to the King of Assyria to Lachish,\" and so on. Well, there it actually is, j'ou see. There's Sennacherib, ancl there's Lachish. Is it not glorious to think that this is a picture done at the time of those very events ? ' ' Yes. We did not quarrel this time, Ethelberta aud I. If I may so put it, it is worse than quarrelling.

' ' Yes, I will really listen,' she said, fluttering her eyelids in her concern at having been so abstracted, and excluding Sennacherib there and then from Christo pher's affairs by the firm settlement of her features to a present-day aspect, ancl her eyes upon his face.

Ethelberta was a firm believer in the kindly effects of artistic education upon the masses. She held that de filement of mind often arose from ignorance of eye ; and her philanthropy being, by the simple force of her situation, of that sort which lingers in the neighbour hood of home, she concentrated her efforts in this kind upon Sol and Dan. Accordingly, the Academy exhibi tion having noAv just opened, she ordered the brothers to appear in their best clothes at the entrance to Burlington House just after noontide on the Saturday of the first week, this being the only day and hour at which they could attend without ' losing a half,' and therefore it was necessary to put up with the in convenience of arriving at a crowded and enervating time.

They welcomed her with a painfully lavish exhibition of large neAv gloves, ancl chests covered Avith broad trian gular areas of padded blue silk, occupying the position that the shirt-front had occupied in earlier clays, and supposed to be lineally descended from the tie of a neckerchief. The dress of their sister for to-day was exactly that of a respectable workman's relative who had no parti cular ambition in the matter of fashion \u2014 a black stuff gOAvn, a plain bonnet to match.

' Noav,' said Ethelberta, in a Avarning whisper, ' we are coming near the picture Avhich was partly painted from myself.

While they were standing here in the very heart of the throng Ethelberta's ears Avere arrested by two male voices behind her, Avhose Avords formed a novel con trast to those of the other speakers around.

' Of course, of course.' Then there Avas a slight laugh, and the companions proceeded to other gossip. Ethelberta, calm and compressed in manner, sidled along to extricate herself, not daring to turn round, and Dan and Sol followed, till they were all clear of the spot. The brothers, who had heard the words equally well Avith Ethelberta, made no remark to her upon them, assuming that they referred to some peculiar system of courtship adopted in high life, with which they had rightly no concern. Ethelberta ostensibly continued her business of tutoring the young workmen just as before, though every emotion in her had been put on the alert by this discovery. She had knoAvn that Neigh admired her; yet his presumption in uttering such a remark as he Avas reported to have uttered, confidentially or other wise, nearly took aAvay her breath. Perhaps it Avas not altogether disagreeable to have her breath so taken away. ' I mean to marry that lady.' She Avhispered the words to herself twenty times in the course of the after noon. Sol and Dan were left considerably longer to their private perceptions of the false and true in art than they had been earlier in the day. When she reached home Ethelberta Avas still far-"], [305, "283 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. removed in her reflections ; and it Avas noticed after wards that about this time in her career her openness of manner entirely deserted her. She mostly Avas silent as to her thoughts, and she Avore an air of unu sual stillness. It was the silence ancl stillness of a starry sky, Avhere all is force and motion. This deep undecipherable habit sometimes suggested, though it did not reveal, Ethelberta's busy brain to her sisters, and they said to one another, ' I cannot think what's coining to Berta : she is not so nice as she used to be.' The evening under notice Avas passed desultorily enough after the discovery of Neigh's self-assured state ment. Among other things that she did after dark, while still musingly examining the probabilities of the report turning out true, Avas to wander to the large attic Avhere the children slept, a frequent habit of hers at night to learn if they were snug and comfortable. They Avere talking noAv from bed to bed, the person under discussion being herself. Herself seemed every where to-day. ' I know that she is a fairy,' Myrtle was insisting, ' because she must be, to have such pretty things in her house, and Avear silk dresses such as mother and we and Picotee haven't got, and have money to give us whenever we want it.' ' Emmeline says perhaps she knows the fairy's god mother, and is not a fairy herself, because Berta is too tall for a real fairy.'"], [306, "284 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. ' She must be one ; for when there was a notch burnt in the hem of my pretty blue frock she said it should be gone in the morning if I would go to bed and not cry ; and in the morning it was gone, ancl ali mee and straight as new.' Ethelberta was recalling to mind how she had sat up ancl repaired the damage alluded to by cutting off half an inch of the skirt all round and hemming it aneAV, when the breathing of the children became regular, and they fell asleep. Here were bright little minds ready for a training, whicli Avithout money and influence she could never give them. The wisdom which knoAA'ledge brings, and the poAver which Avisdom may bring, she had always assumed would be theirs in her dreams for their social elevation. By what means were these things to be ensured to them if her skill in bread-winning should fail her? Would not a well contrived marriage be of service ? She covered and tucked in one more closely, lifted another upon the pillow and straightened the soft limbs to an easy posi tion ; then sat down by the windoAv and looked out at the flashing stars. Thoughts of Neigh's audacious statement returned again upon Ethelberta. He had said that he meant to marry her. Of what standing was the man avIio had uttered such an intention respecting one to Avhom a politic marriage had become almost a necessity of existence ? She had often heard Neigh speak indefinitely of"], [307, "285 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. some estate \u2014 ' my httle place' he had called it \u2014 which he had purchased no very long time ago. All she knew AA'as that its name was Harefield, that it lay from twenty to forty miles out of London in a south-westerly direction, a railway station in the district bearing the same name, so that there was probably a village or small toAvn adjoining. Whether the dignity of this landed property was that of domain, farmstead, allot ment, or garden-plot, Ethelberta had not the slightest conception. She AA'as almost certain that Neigh never lived there, but that might signify nothing. The exact size and value of the estate would, she mused, be cu rious, interesting, and almost necessary information to her Avho must become mistress of it were she to alloAv him to carry out his singularly cool and crude, if tender, intention. Moreover, its importance would afford a very good random sample of his worldly sub stance throughout, from which alone, after all, could the true spirit and Avorth and seriousness of his words be apprehended. Impecuniosity may revel in unquali fied voavs and brim over with confessions as blithely as a bhd of May, but such careless pleasures are not for the solvent, whose very dreams are negotiable, and are expressed Avith due care accordingly. That Neigh had used the Avords she had far more than primd-facie appearances for believing. Neigh's own conduct toAvards her, though peculiar rather than devoted, found in these Avords alone a reasonable key."], [308, "286 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. But, supposing the estate to be such a verbal hallucina tion as, for instance, hers had been at ArroAvthorne, Avhen her poor, unprogressive, hopelessly impracticable Christopher came there to visit her, aud Avas so won derfully undeceived about her social standing : what a fiasco, ancl Avhat a cuckoo-cry Avould his utterances about marriage seem then. Christopher had often told her of his expectations from ' ArroAvthorne Lodge,' and of the blunders that had resulted in consequence. Had not Ethelberta's affection for Christopher partaken less of lover's passion than of old-established tutelary tenderness she might have been reminded by this re flection of the transcendent fidelity he had shoAvn under that trial \u2014 as severe a trial, considering the abnormal, almost morbid, development of the passion for position in present-day society, as can be prepared for men Avho move in the ordinary, unheroic channels of life. By the folloAving evening the consideration of this possibility, that Neigh's position might furnish scope for such a disillusive discovery by herself as hers had afforded to Christopher, decoyed Ethelberta into a curious little scheme. She was piqued into a practical undertaking by the man who could say to his friend Avith such sangfroid, ' I mean to marry that ladj-.'

With the decline and departure of the sun a fog gathered itself out of the low meadow land that bor dered the railway as they went along toAvards the west, stretching over it like a placid lake, till, at the end of the journey, the mist became generally pervasive, though not dense. Avoiding observation as much as they conveniently could, the two sisters walked from the long Avooden shed Avhich formed the station here, into the rheumy air and along the road to the open country. Picotee occasionally questioned Ethelberta on the object of the strange journey : she did not question closely, being satisfied that in such sure hands as Ethelberta's she was safe. Deeming it unwise to make any enquiry just yet beyond the simple one of the way to Harefield, Ethel berta led her companion along a neAvly-fenced road across a heath. In due time they came to an orna mental gate Avith a semicircular Avail on each side, signifying the entrance to some enclosed property or other. Ethelberta, being quite free from any digested plan for encouraging Neigh in his resolve to Avive, Avas startled to find a hope in her that this very respectable beginning before their eyes was the entrance to the Harefield property : that she hoped it was nevertheless unquestionable. Just beyond lay a turnpike-house,"], [310, "288 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. Avhere was dimly visible a woman in the act of putting up a shutter to the windoAv looking upon the road. Compelled by this time to come to special questions, Ethelberta instructed Picotee to ask of this person if the place they had just passed Avas the entrance to Harefield Park. The Avoman replied that it was. Directly she had gone indoors Ethelberta turned back again toAvards the park gate. ' What have Ave come for, Berta ? ' said Picotee, as she turned also. ' I'll tell you some day,' replied her sister. It was now much past eight o'clock, and, from the nature of the evening, dusk. The last stopping up train Avas about ten, so that half an hour could well be afforded for looking round. Ethelberta went to the gate, Avhich Avas found to be fastened by a chain and padlock. ' Ah, the London season,' she murmured. There was a wicket at the side, and they entered. An avenue of young fir trees three or four feet in height extended from the gate into the mist, and doAvn this they Avalked. The drive Avas not in very good order, and the two Avomen Avere frequently obliged to walk on the grass to avoid the rough stones in the carriage-way. The double line of young firs now abruptly terminated, and the road SAvept lower, bend ing to the right, immediately in front being a large lake, calm and silent as a second sky. They could"], [311, ""], [312, "TlllC J-lAIUCfclJCLD ESTATIC."], [313, "TIIE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 289 hear from somewhere on the margin the purl of a weir, and around were clumps of shrubs, araucarias and deo dars being the commonest. Ethelberta could not resist being charmed with the repose of the spot, and hastened on Avith curiosity to reach the other side of the pool, Avhere, by every law of manorial topography, the mansion Avould be situate. The fog concealed aU objects beyond a distance of twenty yards or thereabouts, but it Avas nearly full moon, and though the orb was hidden, a pale diffused light enabled them to see objects in the foreground. Eeaching the other side of the lake the drive enlarged itself most legitimately to a large oval, as for a sweep before a door, a pile of rockwork standing in the midst. But where should have been the front door of a mansion Avas simply a rough rail fence, about four feet high. They drew near and looked over. In the enclosure, and on the site of the imaginary house, was an extraordinary group. It consisted of numerous horses in the last stage of decrepitude, the animals being such mere skeletons that at first Ethelberta hardly recognised them to be horses at all ; they seemed rather to be specimens of some attenuated heraldic animal, scarcely thick enough through the body to cast a shadow ; or enlarged castings of the fire-dog of past times. These poor creatures were endeavouring to make a meal from herbage so trodden and thin that vol. i. u"], [314, "290 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. scarcely a Avholesome blade remained; the little that there was consisted of the sourer sorts common on such sandy soils, mingled Avith tufts of heather and sprouting ferns. ' Why have we come here, dear Berta ? ' said Picotee, shuddering. ' I hardly know,' said Ethelberta. Adjoining this enclosure Avas another and smaller one, formed of high boarding, within which appeared to be some sheds and outhouses. Ethelberta looked through the crevices, and saw that in the midst of the yard stood trunks of trees as if they Avere growing, with branches also extending, but these Avere sawn off at the points where they began to be flexible, no twigs or boughs remaining. Each torso Avas not unlike a huge hat-stand, and suspended to the pegs and prongs were lumps of some substance Avhich at first she did not recognise ; they proved to be a chronological sequel to the previous scene. Horses' skulls, ribs, quarters, legs, and other joints were hung thereon, the Avhole forming a huge open-air larder emitting not too SAveet a smell. But Avhat Stygian sound Avas this ? There had arisen at the moment upon the mute aud sleepy air a varied hoAvling from a hundred tongues. It had burst from a spot close at hand \u2014 a Ioav Avooden buildiu\u00b0- by a stream which fed the lake \u2014 ancl reverberated for miles. No further explanation was required."], [315, "291 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. ' We are close to a kennel of hounds,' said Ethel berta, as Picotee held tightly to her arm. ' They can not get out, so you need not fear. They have a horrid Avay of suddenly beginning thus at different horns of the night, for no apparent reason : though perhaps they hear us. These poor horses are Avaiting to be killed for their food.' The experience altogether, from its intense melan choly, was very depressing, almost appalling to the two lone young women, and they quickly retraced their footsteps. The pleasant lake, the purl of the Aveir, the rudimentary laAvns, shrubberies, and avenue, had changed their character quite. Ethelberta fancied at that moment that she could not have married Neigh, even had she loved him, so horrid did his belongings appear to be. But for many other reasons she had been gradually feehng within this horn that she Avould not go out of her way at a beck from a man whose interest was so unimpassioned. Thinking no more of him as a possible husband she ceased to be afraid to make enquiries about the pecu liarities of his possessions. In the high road they came upon a local man, resting from wheeling a wheelbar row, and Ethelberta asked him, Avith the air of a coun trywoman, who owned the estate across the road. ' The man owning that is one of the name of Neigh,' said the native, wiping his face.

' Indeed ! ' ' Yes, and since then he has let the land to the Honourable Mr. Mountclere, a brother of Lord Mount clere's, and a sort of chum of Mr. Neigh's. Mr. Mountclere wanted the spot for a kennel, and as the land is too poor and sandy for cropping, Mr. Neigh let him have it. 'Tis his hounds that you hear howling.' ' What did Mr. Neigh's father do to so disgust his son?' ' Married his cook, and 'tAvas considered a disgrace to the famdy by young Neigh, who hated that one of the servant class should mix up with his blood.' They passed on. ' Berta, why did we come down here ? ' said Picotee. ' To see the nakedness of the land. It Avas a Avhim only, and as it will end in nothing, it is not A\\-orth Avhile for me to make further explanation.' It was with a curious sense of renunciation that Ethelberta Avent homeAA'ard.

CHAPTEE XXVTH ETHELBERTA'S DRAWING-ROOM. While Ethelberta during the next feAV days was dis missing that evening journey from her consideration, as an incident altogether foreign to the organised course of her existence, the hidden fruit thereof Avas rounding to maturity in a species unforeseen. Inferences unassailable as processes are, neverthe less, to be suspected from the almost certain deficiency of particulars on some side or other. The truth in re lation to Neigh's supposed frigidity was brought before her at the end of the following Aveek, Avhen Dan and Sol had taken Picotee, Corneha, and the young children to Kew for the afternoon. Early that morning, hours before it was necessary, there had been such a chatter of preparation in the house as was seldom heard there. Sunday hats and bonnets had been retrimmed Avith such cunning that it would have taken a milliner's apprentice at least to discover that any thread in them Avas not quite new. There was an anxious peep through the blind at the sky at daybreak by Georgina and Myrtle, and the per-"], [319, "295 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. plexity of these rural children was great at the weather signs of town, where atmospheric effects had nothing to do with clouds, and fair days and foul came apparently quite by chance. Punctually at the hour appointed two friendly human shadows descended across the kitchen window, followed by Sol and Dan, much to the relief of the children's apprehensions that they might forget the day. The brothers were by this time acquiring something of the air and manners of London workmen ; thev were less spontaneous and more comparative ; less genial, but smarter ; in obedience to the usual law by Avhich the emotion that takes the form of humour in country workmen becomes transmuted to irony among the same order in town. But the fixed and dogged fidelity to one another under apparent coolness, by which this family Avas distinguished, remained unshaken in these members as in aU the rest, leading them to select the children as companions in their holiday in preference to casual acquaintance. At last they were ready, and departed, and Ethelberta, after chatting with her mother awhde, proceeded to her personal duties. The house was very sdent that day, Gwendohne and Joey being the only ones left below stairs. Ethel berta Avas wishing that she had thrown off her state and gone to Kew to have an hour of childhood over again in a romp with the others, when she was startled by the announcement of a male visitor \u2014 none other than Mr. Neigh."], [320, "296 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. Ethelberta's attitude on receipt of this information sufficiently expressed a revived sense that the incidence of Mr. Neigh on her path might have a meaning after all. Neigh had certainly said he was going to marry her, and iioav here he Avas come to her house \u2014 just as if he meant to do it forthwith. She had mentally dis carded him ; yet she felt a shock Avhich was scarcely painful, and a dread which was almost exhilarating. Her flying visit to Harefield she thought little of at this moment. From the fact that the mind prefers imagi nings to recapitulation, conjecture to history, Ethelberta had dwelt more upon Neigh's possible plans and antici pations than upon the incidents of her evening journey ; and the former assumed a more distinct shape in her mind's eye than anything on the visible side of the curtain. Neigh Avas perhaps not quite so placidly nonchalant as in ordinary ; still, he was by far the most trying visitor that Ethelberta had lately faced, and she could not get above the stage \u2014 not a very high one for the mistress of a house \u2014 of feeling her personality to be inconveniently in the Avay of his eyes. He had some- Avhat the bearing of a man who Avas going to do Avith out any fuss what gushing people Avould call a philan thropic action.

' If that's the case I may as weU say no more. To burden you with my regrets Avould be out of place, I suppose,' said Neigh, looking calmly out of the window.

If it had not been for that I should never have ventured to call. I might otherwise have sup posed your interest to be fixed in another quarter ; but your acting in that manner encouraged me to think you could listen to a word.' ' What do you allude to ? ' said Ethelberta. ' How have I acted ? ' Neigh appeared reluctant to go any further ; but the allusion soon became sufficiently clear. ' I wish my little place at Harefield had been worthier of you,' he said brusquely. ' However, that's a matter of time only. It is useless to build a house there yet. I wish I had known that you would be looking over it at that time of the evening. A single word, when we were talking about it the other day, that you were going to be in the neighbourhood, would have been sufficient. Nothing could have given me so much delight as to have driven you round.' He knew that she had been to Harefield : that knowledge was what had inspired him to call upon her to-day! Ethelberta breathed a sort of exclamation, not right out, but stealthily, like a parson's damn.

' Yes, I walked round,' said Ethelberta, faintly. Neigh was decidedly master of the position at last ; but he spoke as if he did not value that. His know ledge had furnished him with grounds for calling upon her, and he hastened to undeceive her from supposing that he could think ill of any motive of hers Avhich gave him those desirable grounds. ' I supposed you, by that, to give some little thought to me occasionally,' he resumed, in the same slow and orderly tone. ' Hoav could I help thinking so ? It was your doing that which encouraged me. Now, was it not natural \u2014 I put it to you ?

' I hope sincerely that I never said anything to disturb you.' ' Yes, you did \u2014 not to me, but to somebody,' said Ethelberta, Avith her eyes over-full of retained tears. ' What have I said to somebody that can be in the least objectionable to you ? ' enquired Neigh, with much concern. ' You said \u2014 you said, you meant to marry me \u2014 just as if I had no voice in the matter ! And that annoyed me, and made me go there out of curiosity.' Neigh changed colour a httle. ' WeU, I did say it : I own that I said it,' he replied at last. Probably he knew enough of her nature not to feel long discon- certed by her disclosure, however she might have become possessed of the information. The explanation was certainly a great excuse to her curiosity ; but if Ethel- berta had tried she could not have given him a better ground for making light of her objections to his suit. 'I felt that I must marry you, that we were pre- destined to marry ages ago, and I feel it still ! ' he continued, Avith listless ardour.

' And would you marry any woman off-hand, Avith out being thoroughly acquainted with her circum stances ?

I know you are beautiful, for all London owns it ; I know you are talented, for I have read your poetry and heard your romances ; ancl I know you are politic and discreet ' ' For I have examined your property,' said she, with a weak smile.

Ethelberta as she sat felt herself much less a Pe thenvin than a Chickerel, much less a poetess richly freighted Avith fancy than an adventuress with a nebulous prospect. Neigh was one of the few men whose presence seemed to attenuate her dignity in some mysterious Avay to its very least proportions ; and that act of espial, Avhich had so quickly and inexplicably come to his knoAvledge, helped his influence still more. She knew little of the nature of the town bachelor ; there were opaque depths in him Avhich her thoughts had never definitely plumbed. Notwithstanding her exaltation to the atmosphere of the Petherwin family, Ethelberta was very far from having the thoroughbred London woman's knoAvledge of sets, grades, coteries, cliques, forms, glosses, and niceties, particularly on the masculine side. Setting the years from her infancy to her first look into town against those linking that epoch with the present, the former period covered not only the greater time, but contained the mass of her most vivid impressions of life and its Avays. But in recognising her oavii ignorance of the ratio that words to Avomen bear to deeds to women in the ethical code of the bachelor of the club, she forgot that human nature in the gross differs little Avith situation, and that a gift Avhich, if the germs were lacking, no amount of training in clubs and coteries could supply, was mother wit like her oavu. x AOL. l."], [330, "THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 306 CHAPTEE XXIX. MRS. BELMAINE'S \u2014 CRIPPLEGATE CHURCH. Neigh's remark that he beheved he should see Ethel berta again the next day referred to a contemplated pilgrimage of an unusual sort which had been arranged for that day by Mrs. Belmaine upon the ground of an incidental suggestion of Ethelberta's. One afternoon in the week previous they had been chatting over tea at the house of the former lady, Neigh being present as a casual caller, when the conversation was directed upon Milton by somebody opening a volume of the poet's Avorks that lay on a table near. ' Milton ! thou shouldst be living at this hour : England hath need of thee- said Mrs. Belmaine with the degree of flippancy Avhich is considered correct for immortal verse, the Bible, God, &c. in these days. And Ethelberta rephed, ht up by a quick remembrance, 'It is a good time to talk of Milton ; for I have been much impressed by reading the \"Life;\" and I have decided to go and see his tomb. Could Ave not all go ? We ought to quicken our memories of the"], [331, "307 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA great, ancl of Avhere they lie, by such a visit occa sionally.' ' We ought,' said Mrs. Belmaine. 'And why shouldn't Ave ? ' continued Ethelberta Avith interest. ' To Westminster Abbey ? ' said Mr. Belmaine, a common man of thirty, younger than his wife, who had lately come into the room. ' No ; to where he lies comparatively alone \u2014 Crip plegate Church.' ' I ahvays thought that Milton Avas buried in Poet's Corner,' said Mr. Belmaine. ' So did I,' said Neigh ; ' but I have such an indif ferent head for places that my thinking goes for nothing.' ' Well, it would be a pretty thing to do,' said Mrs. Belmaine, ' and instructive to all of us. If Mrs. Pether- Avin would like to go, I should. We can take you in the carriage, and call round for Mrs. Doncastle on our way, and set you both doAvn again coming back.' ' That Avould be excellent,' said Ethelberta. ' There is nowhere I like going to so much as the depths of the city. The absurd narrowness of Avorld-renoAvned streets is so surprising \u2014 so crooked and shady as they are too, and full of the quaint smeUs of old cupboards and cellars. Walking through one of them reminds me of being at the bottom of some crevasse or gorge, x 2"], [332, "THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 308 the proper surface of the globe being the tops of the houses.' ' You will come to take care of us, John ? And you, Mr. Neigh, would like to come ? We wul teU Mr. Ladywell that he may join us if he cares to,' said Mrs. Belmaine. ' Oh, yes,' said her husband quietly ; and Neigh said he should like nothing better, after a faint aspect of apprehension at the remoteness of the idea from the daily track of his thoughts. Mr. Belmaine observing this, and mistaking it for an indication that Neigh had been dragged into the party against his avUI by his over hasty Avife, arranged that Neigh should go independently and meet them there at the hour named if he chose to do so, to give him an opportunity of staying aAvay. Ethelberta also Avas by this time doubting if she had not been too eager with her proposal. To go on such a sentimental errand might be thought by her friends to be simply troublesome, their adherence having beeu given only in the regular course of complaisance. She was still comparatively an outsider here, her life Avith Lady Petherwin having been passed chiefly in alterna tions between English watering-places and continental towns. However, it was too late now to muse on this, and it may be added that from first to last Ethelberta never discovered from the Belmaines A\\diether her pro posal had been an infliction or a charm, so perfectly were they practised in sustaining that complete divorce"], [333, "309 TIIE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. betAveen thinking and saying Avhich is the hall-mark of high civilisation. ' BetAveen these and my poor crude Sol ancl Dan Iioav great a gulf is fixed ! ' she said to herself, well knowing Iioav plainly they Avould have grumbled at first if under such circumstances they had seen no pleasure to themselves iu accompanying her, and on second thoughts how determined they would have been to go, on the moral ground of giving pleasure to her. The same result, it is true ; but reached openly ; and her heart naturally clung to the manners familiar to her in childhood, though imprac ticable now. But, however she might doubt the Belmaines, she had no doubt as to Neigh's true sentiments : the time had come when he, notwithstanding his air of being oppressed by almost every lively invention of town and country for charming griefs to rest, would not be at all oppressed by a quiet visit to the purlieus of St. Giles's, Cripplegate, since she was the originator, and was going herself. It Avas a bright hope-inspiring afternoon in this mid-May time when the carriage containing Mr. ancl Mrs. Belmaine, Mrs. Doncastle, and Ethelberta crept along the encumbered streets towards Barbican ; till turning out of that thoroughfare into Eedcross Street they beheld the bold shape of the old tower they sought, clothed in every neutral shade, standing clear against the sky, dusky and grim in its upper stage, and"], [334, "310 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. hoary grey below, where every corner of every stone was completely rounded off by the Avaves of wind and storm. AU people were busy here : our visitors seemed to be the only idle persons the city contained ; and there was no dissonance \u2014 there never is \u2014 betAveen antiquity and such beehive industry ; for pure industry, in failing to observe its own existence and aspect, partakes of the unobtrusive nature of material things. This intramural stir was a flyAvheel transparent by infinite motion, through which Milton and his day could be seen as if nothing intervened. Had there been ostensibly har monious accessories, a crowd of observing people in search of the poetical, conscious of the place aud the scene, what a chscord Avould have arisen there ! But everybody passed by Milton's grave except Ethelberta and her friends, and for the moment the city's less invidious conduct appeared to her more respectful as a practice than her OAvn. But she was brought out of this rumination by the halt at the church door, ancl completely reminded of the present by finding the church open, and Neigh \u2014 the, till yesterday, unimpassioned Neigh \u2014 Avaitino- in the vestibule to receive them, just as if he lived there. LadyAvell had not arrived. It Avas a long time before Ethelberta could get back to Milton again, for Neio-li was continuing to impend over her future more and more visibly. Tlie objects along the journey had dis-"], [335, "311 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. tracted her mind from him ; but the moment iioav Avas as a direct renewal and prolongation of the declaration time yesterday, and as if in furtherance of the conclu sion of the episode. They all alighted and Avent in, the coachman being told to take the carriage to a quiet nook further on, and return in half-an-hour. Mrs. Belmaine and her car riage some years before had accidentally got jammed crosswise in Cheapside through the clumsiness of the man in turning up a side street, blocking that great artery of the civilised world for the space of a minute and a half, when they were pounced upon by half-a dozen policemen and forced to back ignominiously up a little slit between the houses where they did not mean to go, amid the shouts of the drivers by ; and it Avas her nervous recoUection of that event which caused Mrs. Belmaine to be so precise in her direc tions now. By the time that they Avere grouped around the tomb the visit had assumed a much more solemn com plexion than anyone among them had anticipated. Ashamed of the influence that she discovered Neigh to be exercising over her, and opposing it steadily, Ethel berta drew from her pocket a small edition of Milton, and proposed that she should read a few lines from 'Paradise Lost.' The responsibility of producing a suc cessful afternoon Avas upon her shoulders; she was, moreover, the only one present Avho could properly"], [336, "312 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. manage blank verse, and this was sufficient to justify the proposal. She stood with her head against the marble slab just below the bust, ancl began a selected piece, Neigh standing a feAV yards off on her right looking into his hat in order to listen accurately, Mr. and Mrs. Belmaine and Mrs. Doncastle seating themselves in a pew directly facing the monument. The ripe Avarm colours of after noon came in upon them from the west, upon the saUow piers and arches, and the infinitely deep broAvn peAvs beneath, the aisle over Ethelberta's head being in misty shade through which glowed a lurid light from a dark stained -window behind. The sentences fell from her lips in a rhythmical cadence one by one, and she could be fancied a priestess of him before whose image she stood Avhen with a vivid suggestiveness she delivered here, not many yards from the central money-miU of the Avorld, yet out from the very tomb of their author, the passage containing the Avords Mammon led them on ; Mammon, the least erected spirit that fell From heaven. When she had finished reading Ethelberta left the monument, and then each one present strayed indepen dently about the building, Ethelberta turning to the left along the passage to the south door. Neigh \u2014 from whose usually apathetic face and eyes there had pro ceeded a secret smouldering light as he listened and re-"], [337, "THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 313 garded her \u2014 followed in the same directiou and vanished at her heels into the churchyard, Avhither she had noAv gone. Mr. and Mrs. Belmaine exchanged glances, and instead of folloAving the pair they went with Mrs. Don castle into the vestry to enquire of the person in charge for the register of the marriage of Oliver Crom well, which Avas solemnised here. The church was noAv quite empty, and its stillness Avas as a vacuum into which an occasional noise from the street overflowed and became rarefied aAvay to nothing. Something like five minutes had passed Avhen a hansom stopped outside the door, and Ladywell entered the porch. He stood still, and, looking enquiringly round for a minute or two, sat down in one of the high peAvs, as if under the impression that the others had not yet arrived. While he sat here Neigh reappeared at the south door opposite, and came slowly in. LadyweU, in rising to go to him, saw that Neigh's attention was engrossed by something he held in his hand. It was his pocket book, and Neigh was looking at a few loose flower petals Avhich had been placed between the pages. When Ladywell came forward Neigh looked up, started, and closed the book quickly, so that some of the petals fluttered to the ground between the two men. They were striped, red and white, and appeared to be leaves of the Harlequin rose. ' Ah ! here you are, Ladywell,' he said, recovering"], [338, "314 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. himself. ' We had given you up : my aunt said that you would not care to come. They are all in the vestry.' How it came to pass that Neigh designated those in the vestry as ' aU,' when there was one in the churchyard, Avas a thing that he himself could hardly have explained, so much more had it to do with instinct than Avith calculation. ' Never mind them \u2014 don't interrupt them,' said LadyAvell. ' The plain truth is that I have been very greatly disturbed in mind ; and I could not appear earher by reason of it. I had some doubt about coming at all.' ' I am sorry to hear that. ' Neigh \u2014 I may as well tell you and have done with it. I have found that a lady of my acquaintance has two strings to her bow, or I am very much in error.' 'What\u2014 Mrs. Petherwin?' said Neigh, uneasily. ' But I thought that \u2014 that fancy was over with you long ago. Even your acquaintance with her was at an end, I thought.' ' In a measure it is at an end. But let me teU you that what you call a fancy has been anything but a fancy with me, to be over like a spring shoAver. To speak plainly, Neigh, I consider myself badly used by that Avoman ; d badly used.' ' Badly used ? ' said Neigh, mechanically, and won-"], [339, "THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. 315 dering all the time if Ladywell had been informed that Ethelberta Avas to be one of the party to-day. ' Well, I ought not to talk like that,' said LadyweU, adopting a lighter tone. ' All is fair in courtship, I suppose, now as ever. Indeed, I mean to put a good face upon it : if I am beaten, I am. But it is very pro voking, after supposing matters to be going on smoothly, to find out that you are quite mistaken.' ' I told you you were quite mistaken in supposing she cared for you.' ' That is just the point I was not mistaken in,' said Ladywell, Avarmly. ' She did care for me, and I stood as well Avith her as any man could stand until this felloAv came, whoever he is. I sometimes feel so dis turbed about it that I have a good mind to call upon her and ask his name. Wouldn't you, Neigh ? WiU you accompany me ? ' ' I would in a moment, but, but \u2014 I strongly advise you not to go,' said Neigh, earnestly. ' It would be rash, you know, and rather unmannerly ; and would only hurt your feelings.' ' Well, I am always ready to yield to a friend's arguments .... A sneaking scamp, that's what he is. Why does he not show himself? ' ' Don't you really know Avho he is ? ' said Neigh, in a pronounced and exceptional tone, on purpose to give Ladywell a chance of suspecting, for the position was getting awkward. But LadyAvell was blind as"], [340, "316 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. Bartimeus in that direction, so AveU had indifference to Ethelberta's charms been feigned by Neigh untd he thought seriously of marrying her. Yet, unfortunately for the interests of calmness, LadyAvell was less blind with his outward eye. In his reflections his glance had lingered again upon the pocket-book which Neigh still held in his hand, and upon the tAvo or three rose leaves on the floor, until he said idly, superimposing humorousness upon misery, as men in love can : ' Eose-leaves, Neigh ? I thought you did not care for flowers. What makes )-ou amuse yourself with such sentimental objects as they, only fit for women, or painters like me ? If I had not observed you with my oavii eyes I should have said that you were about the last man in the world to care for things of that sort. Whatever makes you keep rose-leaves in your pocket-book ? ' ' The best reason on earth,' said Neigh. 'A woman gave them to me.' ' That proves nothing unless she is a great deal to you,' said LadyAvell, with the experienced air of a man who, Avhatever his inferiority in years to Neigh, was far beyond him in knoAvledge of that sort, by virtue of his recent trials. ' She is a great deal to me.' ' If I chd not knoAv you to be such a con firmed misogynist I should say that this is a serious matter.'"], [341, "317 TIIE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. ' It is serious,' said Neigh quietly. ' The proba bility is that I shall marry the Avoman who gave me these. AnyhoAV I have asked her the question, and she has not altogether said no.' ' I am glad to hear it, Neigh,' said Ladywell heartily. ' I am glad to hear that your star is higher than mine.' Before Neigh could make further reply LadyweU Avas attracted by the gloAv of green sunlight reflected through the south door by the grass of the church yard, iioav in all its spring freshness and luxuriance. He bent his steps thither, followed anxiously by Neigh. ' I had no idea there was such a lovely green spot in the city,' LadyAvell continued, passing out. ' Trees, too, planted in the manner of an orchard. What a charming place ! ' The place Avas truly charming just at that date. The untainted leaves of the lime and plane-trees and the neAvly-sprung grass had in the sun a brilliancy of beauty that was brought into extraordinary prominence by the sable soil showing here and there, ancl the charcoaled stems and trunks out of Avhich the leaves budded : they seemed an importation, not a produce, and their delicacy such as would perish in a day. ' What is this round tower ? ' Ladywell said again, walking towards the iron-grey bastion, partly covered with ivy ancl Virginia creeper, Avhich stood obtruding into the enclosure."], [342, "318 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. ' Oh, didn't you know that was here ? That's a piece of the old city wall,' said Neigh, looking furtively around at the same time. Behind the bastion the churchyard ran into a long narroAv strip, grassed like the other part, but completely hidden from it by the cylinder of ragged masonry. On rounding this pro jection, Ladywell beheld Avithin a few feet of him a lady whom he knew too well. ' Mrs. Petherwin here ! ' exclaimed he, proving hoAV ignorant he had been of the composition of the party he Avas to meet, and accounting at the same time for his laxity in attending it. ' I forgot to teU you,' said Neigh aAvkwardly, behind him, ' that Mrs. Petherwin was to come with us.' Ethelberta's look Avas someAvhat blushful and agi tated, as if from some late transaction : she appeared to have been secluding herself there till she should have recovered her equanimity. HoAvever, she came up to him ancl said, ' I did not see you before this moment : Ave had been thinking you Avould not come.' While these Avords AA'ere being prettily spoken, Ladywell's face became pale as death. On Ethelberta's bosom Avere the stem and green calyx of a rose, almost all its flower having disappeared. It had been a Harlequin rose, for two or three of its striped leaves remained to tell the tale. She could not help noticing his fixed gaze, and she said quickly, ' Yes, I have lost my pretty rose : this"], [343, "319 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. may as well go now,' and she plucked the stem from its fastening in her dress and flung it away. Poor LadyAvell turned round to meet Mr. and Mrs. Belmaine, whose voices were beginning to be heard just within the church door, leaving Neigh and Ethel berta together. It was a graceful act of young Lady well's that, in the midst of his oavii pain at the strange tale the rose-leaves suggested \u2014 Neigh's rivalry, Ethel berta's mutability, his own defeat \u2014 he was not regard less of the intense embarrassment which might have been caused had he remained. The two were silent at first, and it was evident that Ethelberta's mood was one of anger at something that had gone before. She turned aside from him to folloAv the others, Avhen Neigh spoke in a tone somewhat bitter and somewhat stern. ' What \u2014 going like that ? After being compro mised together, why don't you close with me ? Lady- Avell knows all : I had already told him that the rose leaves were given me by my intended wife. We seem to him to be practismg deceptions all of a piece, and what foUy it is to play off so ! As to Avhat I did, that I ask your forgiveness for.' Ethelberta looked upon the ground and maintained a compressed lip. Neigh resumed : ' If I showed more feeling than you care for, I insist that it Avas not more than was natural under the circumstances, if not quite proper. Opinions may differ, but my experience goes"], [344, "320 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. to prove that conventional squeamishness at such times as these is more talked ancl written about than practised. Plain behaviour must be expected Avhen marriage is the question. Nevertheless, I do say \u2014 and I cannot say more \u2014 that I am sincerely sorry to have offended you by exceeding my privileges. I will never do so again.' c' ' Don't say privileges. You have none.' ' I am sorry that I thought othenvise, and that others will think so too. LadyAvell is, at any rate, bent on thinking so. . . . It might have been made knoAvn to him in a gentle AA-ay \u2014 but God disposes.' ' There is nothing to make known \u2014 I don't under stand,' said Ethelberta, going from him. By this time LadyAvell had walked round the gravel walks AA'ith the two other ladies and Mr. Belmaine, and they were all turning to come back again. The young painter had deputed his voice to reply to their remarks, but his understanding continued poring upon other things. When he came up to Ethelberta, his agitation had left him : she too was free from constraint ; Avhile Neigh was some distance off, carefully examining nothing in particular in an old fragment of waU. The little party was noAv united again as to its persons ; though in spirit far otherwise. They Avent through the church in general talk, LadyAvell sad but serene, aud Ethelberta keeping far-removed both from him and from Neigh. She had at this juncture entered"], [345, "321 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. upon that Sphinx-like stage of existence in which, con trary to her earlier manner, she signified to no one of her Avays, plans, or sensations, ancl spoke little on any subject at all. There Avere occasional smiles now which came only from the face, and speeches from the lips merely. The journey home was performed as they had come, Ladywell not accepting the seat in Neigh's .cab which Avas phlegmatically offered him. Mrs. Doncastle's ac quaintance with Ethelberta had been slight until this day ; but the afternoon's proceeding had much im pressed the matron with her younger friend. Before they parted she said, with the sort of affability which is meant to signify the beginning of permanent friend ship : ' A friend of my husband's, Lord Mountclere, has been anxious for some time to meet you. He is a great admirer of the poems, ancl more still of the story telling invention, and your power in it. He has been present many times at the Mayfair Hall to hear you. When wdl you dine with us to meet him ? I know you will like him. Will Thursday be convenient ? ' Ethelberta stood for a moment reflecting, and reflecting hoped that Mrs. Doncastle had not noticed her momentary perplexity. Crises were becoming as common as blackberries ; and she had foreseen this one lone7- time. It was not that she was to meet Lord Mountclere, for he was only a name and a distant file to her : it was that her father would necessarily vol. i. Y"], [346, "322 THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. be present at the meeting, in the most anomalous position that human nature could endure. However, having often proved in her disjointed experience that the shortest way out of a difficulty lies straight through it, Ethelberta decided to dine at the Doncastles', and, as she murmured that she should have great pleasure in meeting any friend of theirs, set about contriving how the encounter with her dearest relative might be made safe and unsuspected. She bade them adieu blithely ; but the thoughts engendered by the invitation stood before her as sorroAvful and rayless ghosts which could not be laid. Often at such conjunctures as these, AA-hen the futility of her great undertaking was more than usually manifest, did Ethel berta long like a tired child for the conclusion of the Avhole matter ; when her work should be over, and the evening come ; when she might draw her boat upon the shore, and in some thymy nook await eternal night with a placid mind.
