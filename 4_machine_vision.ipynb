    "We will use below a well-established architecture for machine vision tasks, called **ResNet18**. This is the smallest ResNet available. [The ResNet architecture was introduced in Kaiming He et al. in 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before discussing ResNet, we need to explain **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, the building block.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are a class of deep learning models specifically designed to process and analyze data that has a grid-like topology, such as images. CNNs are a type of artificial neural network and are particularly well-suited for tasks like image recognition, object detection, and various other computer vision tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components of CNNs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convolutional Layers**:\n",
    "   - The core building block of a CNN is the convolutional layer, which applies a set of filters (also known as kernels) across the input image. These filters move across the image spatially (in two dimensions), performing element-wise multiplications and summing up the results. This operation is called a convolution.\n",
    "   - The filters help detect features such as edges, textures, and patterns in the image. As you move deeper into the network, the filters become more complex, detecting higher-level features like shapes and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/Convolutional_neural_network.png\" width=\"600px\" heigth=\"600px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "*[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pooling Layers**:\n",
    "   - Pooling layers are used to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, making the computation more efficient and helping to achieve some level of spatial invariance. The most common pooling operation is max pooling, which selects the maximum value in each patch of the feature map.\n",
    "   - Pooling helps in reducing the number of parameters and computations in the network, which can help prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/Max_pooling.png\" width=\"600px\" heigth=\"600px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "*[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fully Connected Layers**:\n",
    "   - After a series of convolutional and pooling layers, the output is typically passed through one or more fully connected layers (similar to a traditional neural network). These layers combine the features extracted by the convolutional layers to classify the input image or perform other tasks like regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Activation Functions**:\n",
    "   - CNNs use activation functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) to introduce non-linearity into the model. This non-linearity helps the network learn more complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Dropout Layers**:\n",
    "   - To prevent overfitting, dropout layers are often included, which randomly deactivate a portion of the neurons during training. This encourages the network to learn more robust features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How CNNs Work:\n",
    "When an image is passed through a CNN, each layer applies a series of transformations to the image, gradually abstracting and recognizing more complex features. For example, the first layers might detect simple edges, while deeper layers might detect parts of objects like eyes, and the final layers might recognize full objects like faces.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of CNNs:\n",
    "- **Spatial Hierarchy**: CNNs leverage the hierarchical structure of images, where lower layers capture basic features and higher layers capture more complex patterns.\n",
    "- **Parameter Efficiency**: By sharing the weights of filters across the image, CNNs require fewer parameters than fully connected networks, making them more efficient and less prone to overfitting.\n",

    "## ResNet Architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "**ResNet** (Residual Network) is a family of deep convolutional neural networks introduced by [Kaiming He et al. in 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385). The architecture is designed to tackle the challenge of training very deep networks, which typically suffer from problems like vanishing gradients and degradation. ResNet overcomes these issues using residual learning, where shortcut connections bypass one or more layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an illustration of the ResNet (right side), compared with previous architectures:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/res_net.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ResNet-18\n",
    "- **Depth**: 18 layers.\n",
    "- **Architecture**: ResNet-18 uses basic residual blocks, each containing two 3x3 convolutional layers followed by a ReLU activation function. The residual connections bypass these two layers and add the input directly to the output. This network is relatively shallow and is computationally efficient, making it suitable for smaller tasks and scenarios where resources are constrained.\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Suitable for tasks requiring moderate complexity, often used in academic settings for benchmarks and on datasets that do not require deep architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ResNet-50\n",
    "- **Depth**: Depth: 50 layers\n",
    "- **Architecture**: ResNet-50 introduces a more complex block called the bottleneck block. A bottleneck block consists of three layers: a 1x1 convolutional layer for reducing dimensionality, a 3x3 convolutional layer, and another 1x1 convolutional layer to restore the dimensionality. This block reduces the number of parameters while maintaining the network’s depth.\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Often used in practical applications where a balance between model complexity and performance is needed. ResNet-50 is more computationally intensive than ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 but provides better performance on complex tasks.\n",
